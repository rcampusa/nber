                                        ABSTRACT

Using county-level data on COVID-19 mortality and infections, along with county-level
information on the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the United States, we
examine how the speed of NPI adoption affected COVID-19 mortality. Our estimates suggest
that advancing the date of NPI adoption by one day lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4
percent. This finding proves robust to alternative measures of NPI adoption speed, model
specifications that control for testing and mobility, and across various samples: national,
restricted to the Northeast region, excluding New York, and excluding the Northeast region. We
also find that the adoption speed of NPIs is associated with lower infections, as well as lower
non-COVID mortality, suggesting that these measures slowed contagion and the pace at which
the healthcare system might have been overburdened by the pandemic. Finally, NPI adoption
speed appears to have been less relevant in Republican counties, suggesting that political
ideology might have compromised their efficiency.

1.       Introduction

         The COVID-19 pandemic and the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented

in many countries to suppress the contagion have unsettled lives fundamentally and cratered the

global economy. Epidemiologists contend that NPIs—such as safer-at-home orders, closures of

non-essential businesses and schools, or bans on large gatherings—combined with testing,

tracing, and isolating, are the only options to fight the pandemic until a vaccine is identified and

made widely available or societies achieve herd immunity (Ferguson et al., 2006; Pichler et al.,

2017; Tian et al., 2020). Yet, the intensity and vigor of NPI implementation have varied across

countries, reflecting skepticism regarding their efficacy and concerns about their social and

economic impacts.

         In the United States, where COVID-19 has taken a high toll in terms of infections and

mortality, skepticism toward NPIs reigns high among the public and legislators (Funk and

Tyson, 2020). Early in the pandemic, President Trump famously criticized NPIs by remarking

that “the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” The nation remained divided on the

effectiveness of NPIs, even as the pandemic raged from March to early May 2020 in the

northeast, spreading to the rest of the country thereafter.      Surveys show that conservative

Republicans expressed more skepticism about NPIs than liberal Democrats (Funk and Tyson,

2020).    State and local implementation and lifting of NPIs were often driven by political

ideology.    Republican-governed cities were slower in adopting NPIs, whereas cities led by

Democrats were more aggressive (Willetts, 2020).

         Amidst the highly partisan response to the pandemic, the question remains: has the

timeliness of NPIs been effective in saving lives in the United States? Have these interventions

helped reduce the spread of the virus? Has political ambivalence on NPIs influenced their



                                                                                                  1
effectiveness? The aim of this paper is to address these questions using county-level data on

mortality, infections, and NPIs.

        If NPIs have not been successful in the United States, that would mean the government

has needlessly cratered the economy, compromised children’s education, disrupted lives and

livelihoods, and reduced the pace at which herd immunity can be achieved—ultimately

validating public skepticism about these policies. Arguably, NPIs reduce the pace at which a

population can acquire widespread immunity. For this reason, a number of countries, including

the United Kingdom in the initial stages of the pandemic, and Sweden, opted against

implementing NPIs. Additionally, the implementation of NPIs inevitably brings economies to a

halt, resulting in tidal unemployment claims.              Many countries and localities delayed their

adoption and effective implementation to lessen their economic and social effects. These delays

could have adversely affected the spread of the pandemic. Indeed, if NPIs are effective at

reducing contagion, the politicization of NPIs can be blamed for the ambivalence and hesitation

toward their implementation. This ambivalence and hesitation could explain the United States’

failure to contain the virus, even as other developed countries have successfully reduced

infections and mortality.

        A couple of studies in the United States have investigated the effect of stay-at-home

orders on infections and mortality from COVID-19 (Dave et. al. 2020; Fowler et al. 2020).1

Both studies find that NPIs are associated with lower infection and mortality rates. We build on

this research by assessing the relevance of the adoption timing of two NPIs—safer-at-home

orders and non-essential business closures—on mortality.                  Our research differs in that we


1
 There is growing international research on the effects of NPIs including Yun, Chen and Shi (2020) using Chinese
data, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) using data from Spain, and Hsiang et al. (2020) and Imai et al. (2020) using
cross-national data.


                                                                                                                   2
specifically study the effect of NPI timeliness. To that end, we construct a measure that captures

the relative speed of NPI adoption based on a county’s rate of contagion when the NPI was

adopted.2

        Further, we investigate whether NPI efficacy differed across counties with different

political ideologies and different degrees of demographic, economic, and health-related

vulnerabilities.    To do the former, we construct a dummy to identify Republican counties,

defined as counties where most residents voted for President Trump in the 2016 election, and

estimate if NPI efficacy differed in those areas compared to other counties. For the latter, we use

several pre-COVID county demographic, economic, and health characteristics to explore the

differential efficacy of NPIs across counties with distinct degrees of vulnerability. Ideally, we

would use data on COVID-19 mortality according to these traits, but such data are not available.

Instead, we use pre-COVID county-level characteristics to explore differences in the relevance

of NPI adoption timing across counties with different characteristics associated with poor

COVID-19 health outcomes. Finally, we explore mechanisms through which NPI adoption

speed might be critical, focusing on the spread of the infection and the ability to avert an

overwhelmed health care system.

        A challenge in estimating the causal effect of NPIs on mortality is that these interventions

are adopted in response to the spread and severity of the virus. Because of the likely presence of

reverse causality (i.e., COVID-linked deaths could be the cause behind the adoption of NPIs), a

simple correlation between NPIs and COVID-linked mortality or infection will likely result in

biased estimates, although they would likely be biased downwards. We address this by

                                                                                                              3
supplementing our primary analysis with an event study examining how COVID-19 death rates

respond to NPI adoption.

       Because of the ongoing nature of the pandemic, an additional challenge is the chosen

temporal frame for our analysis. We focus on the early months of the pandemic, capturing when

states and counties first adopted NPIs, through the first re-opening.         This means we are

comparing counties at various initial stages of the pandemic. To address this limitation, we

estimate models that separate specific outliers during that period. Specifically, we experiment

with: (i) restricting samples to Northeastern states that were the epicenter of the pandemic during

our study period, (ii) excluding Northeastern states, and (iii) excluding New York. These sample

modifications allow us to compare NPI speed between counties that experienced roughly similar

stages of the pandemic during our study period.

       Any research on the efficacy of NPIs in the United States is affected by the fact that data

on reported infections and COVID-linked mortality are highly correlated with COVID-19

testing, which has varied across the country and over time. In counties with inadequate testing,

reported infections likely underestimate actual infections and deaths attributable to COVID are

likely to be reported as non-COVID mortalities. Further, if testing is correlated with NPIs, it will

confound the estimates of the efficacy of NPIs. We address this by explicitly controlling for

testing. Similarly, to address concerns regarding the possibility that the NPI estimates might be

capturing any endogenous self-distancing potentially taking place prior to the adoption of an

NPI, we include controls for the daily median maximum distance traveled by county residents as

an estimate of mobility at the county level.

       To explore the mechanisms at play, we examine how NPI adoption speed affects

infections, and conduct state-level analyses of the association between NPIs and non-COVID



                                                                                                  4
deaths. Studies document that non-COVID deaths increased during the period of our study

(Woolf et al. 2020). This could have occurred for various reasons, including the voluntary

postponement of procedures or, in some instances, through an overwhelmed healthcare system.

If timely adoption of the NPIs helped reduce the burden on the healthcare system, they should

also lower non-COVID deaths.

        We find that advancing the implementation date of NPIs by one day would have lowered

the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent. The finding proves robust to the use of alternative

measures of NPI adoption speed, to controlling for testing and mobility, and to the removal of

outliers—such as New York and the Northeast region, from the analysis. We also find that the

NPI adoption speed is associated with lower infections and lower non-COVID fatality,

suggesting these measures operated both via slowing down the contagion and the burden of the

pandemic on the healthcare system. We also find that the adoption speed of NPIs proves less

critical in Republican counties, suggesting that the attitudes of the Republican leadership towards

NPIs (e.g. social distancing, wearing masks, business closures) may have compromised their

efficacy.


2.      Data

2.1     Mortality and Infections

        To determine how NPIs affected COVID-19 mortality in the United States, we use

county-level data on COVID-19 deaths and infections collected by the Johns Hopkins

University. This data includes information on the accumulated number of daily COVID-19 cases

and deaths reported by state and local health departments (Dong, Du, and Gardner, 2020).3 We

use 2018 population figures from the American Community Survey to derive daily COVID-19

mortality rates by county.

        We focus our analysis on the period from February 15, 2020 to April 23, 2020. While the

first confirmed case of COVID-19 occurred in late January, country-wide contagion was

reported starting in late February and early March. We lack information on the timing of re-

openings by county.          To avoid confounding the effects of NPI adoption speed with the

continuation of NPI policies, we cap our study period at April 23, 2020, the day before the first

NPI was lifted. 4

        We also collect information on state-level testing and overall mortality from the COVID

Tracking Project and the Centers for Disease Control, respectively. Given that the identification

of COVID-19 infections and attribution of causes of deaths are contingent upon detection, we

use the most detailed information available from the COVID Tracking Project—daily test results

by state—to account for variation in testing. 5 We also collect information on mortality by cause

of death from the Centers for Disease Control to estimate non-COVID deaths. 6 We use the most

detailed information available—weekly deaths by state—to explore some of the mechanisms

responsible for our estimated impact of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality.




deaths were reported. This affected five counties in New York (New York City’s five boroughs were originally
grouped under New York county), two counties in Massachusetts (Dukes and Nantucket), Rhode Island’s five
counties, and 22 counties in Utah. In each of these instances, we aggregate population counts and apply population
weights to estimate aggregated county characteristics for these consolidated areas, which in most cases, we collapse
onto the most populous county. Cases and deaths that were not assigned to a particular geographic area are
excluded from our analysis. These consolidations bring our county total to 3,117, down from 3,142.

2.2     Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions

        We use data from the National Association of Counties (NACo) and Boston University’s

School of Public Health to identify counties with NPIs in place during our study period. NACo

compiles information on the type and timing of NPIs for every county in the United States. 7 We

complement this information with a comprehensive database assembled by Boston University

researchers that records similar measures taken by states. 8 We focus on two types of NPIs: non-

essential business closures and safer-at-home policies.

        While there is overlap between non-essential business closures and safer-at-home orders,

business closure policies only restrict the activities of certain businesses, whereas safer-at-home

orders include provisions that close non-essential businesses in addition to restricting individual

movement. Safer-at-home policies—also referred to as “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place”—

explicitly restrict the movement and activities of individual residents unless they are engaged in

“essential” activities. 9 These policies prohibit residents from gathering or travelling outside of

their homes unless for an essential activity and, as such, often consist of the closure of non-

essential businesses (i.e., restaurants, bars, gyms).             Though policies and enforcement vary,

residents who ignore safer-at-home orders may face a misdemeanor punishable by fine,

imprisonment or both (Harris, 2020).

2.3     Mobility

        We make use of daily mobility data for each county obtained from Descartes Labs to

carry out identification checks and account for variation in compliance with the social distancing

imposed by the NPIs. 10 Commercially available location data from smartphones and other

mobile devices are used to sample the movement of individuals (Warren and Skillman, 2020).

We use estimates of the median maximum distance traveled by residents to estimate daily

mobility at the county level. These statistics are available for March 1, 2020 and beyond.

2.4     County Characteristics

        To investigate whether NPI efficacy differed across counties with different political

ideologies and different degrees of demographic, economic, and health-related vulnerabilities,

we collect information on a series of county-level characteristics. We use information from the

MIT Election Lab to capture county political affiliation, measured as the Republican vote share

in the 2016 presidential election, which we use to identify Republican counties as those with a

Republican vote share exceeding 50 percent. 11             We collect information on a series of

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics sourced from 2018 5-year American Community

Survey estimates. Specifically, we compile estimates on the percent of county residents that are:

(i) over the age of 65, (ii) without health insurance, (iii) unemployed, and (iv) living below the

federal poverty line. Lastly, we use data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Service to

measure county-level chronic disease prevalence. We use information from 2017, the latest year

available, to create a comorbidity index that aggregates the percent of Medicare beneficiaries

with chronic diseases associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, including chronic lung

disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma), heart conditions (atrial fibrillation,

heart failure, Ischemic heart disease), cancer, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, chronic kidney

disease, and liver disease (hepatitis). 12 We standardize the index to have a mean of 0 and a

standard deviation of 1, with larger values indicating higher comorbidities.


3.      Methodology

        Our primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality.

To that end, we start by estimating the following difference-in-differences model specification:

(1)     𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 ) + 𝜌𝜌𝑐𝑐 + 𝜗𝜗𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

where the vector 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 represents the number of COVID deaths per 100,000 in county c and date t.

        We consider two different types of NPIs: safer-at-home policies and non-essential

business closures. Our main regressor is an interaction term made up of two variables: (1)

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , a dummy variable indicative of the period in county c when the NPI was in effect; and

(2) 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 , the relative speed of NPI adoption based on county c’s rate of contagion when

the NPI was adopted. The post-NPI dummy (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) includes a two-week delay to account for

the average amount of time between infection and possible death (Lauer et al., 2020). The

vector 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 measures the number of days between the adoption of the NPI and the first

day-to-day doubling of county-level infections per capita. 13 We multiply this count by minus

one, so that higher values indicate a faster response. 14 This operationalization allows us to gauge

the impact of both the adoption of a particular NPI, as well as the effect of a faster response.

        Equation (1) also includes daily fixed-effects to capture temporal shifts in the incidence

and treatment of the disease across the country, and county fixed-effects to account for time-

invariant differences potentially related to COVID mortality, such as population density, health

infrastructure, and population comorbidities. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.


4.     Descriptive Evidence

       Our methodological approach is inspired in the daily variation in COVID-19 deaths and

deaths per capita displayed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. As shown therein, early- versus

late-adopters of NPIs were seemingly impacted differently. We distinguish among three groups

of counties: (1) early adopters, which include those with safer-at-home or business closure in

place prior to the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita; (2) late adopters, which

include counties that adopted after the first day-to-day doubling; and (3) counties that never

adopted a safer-at-home or business closure policy during our study period. COVID-19 deaths

began to accelerate in mid-March for early and late adopters, but at notably different rates. Peak

COVID-19 death rates in counties classified as late adopters were over 2.5 times as large as the

peaks in early adopting counties. Also noteworthy is the relative dearth of COVID-19 mortality

in the 311 counties that were not subject to an NPI during our study period. Most of these

counties are located in sparsely populated states (i.e., North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and

Wyoming).

       Figure 3 illustrates the staggered adoption of safer-at-home and business closure policies,

which provides the temporal and geographic variation needed for identification. The first NPI

was adopted by the state of California on March 16, 2020. By March 20, a total of 134 counties,

including California’s 58, had an NPI in place. As illustrated in the subsequent maps, most NPI

adoptions occurred in late-March and early-April. By March 30, a total of 1,979 counties were

subject to a safer-at-home, business closure order, or both. This number grew to 2,806 by April

6—after which, no additional NPIs were implemented during the period covered in this study.


                                                                                                   10
       Table 1 displays basic descriptive statistics for the full sample, and by NPI adoption

timing for the 3,117 counties included in our sample.        Counties were observed daily from

February 15 April 23, 2020 (69 days). The descriptive statistics confirm the trends illustrated in

the figures. COVID-19 infections and mortality were lower in early-adopting counties when

compared to counties adopting NPI measures late, despite the larger number of tests performed

in the latter group. Counties that never adopted the measures were the smallest in size and had

COVID-19 infections and mortality figures that were well below those of late and early NPI

adopters. There are other differences worth noting across counties. For instance, counties that

were early NPI adopters were somewhat between non-adopters and late adopters in terms of size.

In terms of pre-COVID characteristics, the early adopters had higher mobility indexes, a larger

share of elderly and people living in poverty, and were more likely to be classified as

Republican. In contrast, late NPI adopting counties were, by far, the largest in size and had

higher comorbidity indexes. However, differences in unemployment rates and health insurance

were not large across counties that adopted NPIs early, late, or never.


5.     Main Findings and Robustness Checks

       Our main objective is to learn about the importance of timing when adopting NPIs in

fighting COVID-19 mortality. If timing proves critical, a secondary objective is to gain a better

understanding of the channels enabling the effectiveness of the NPI in curtailing deaths—an

investigation that involves uncovering heterogenous impacts of the adopted NPIs.

       To achieve our main aim, we start by estimating several model specifications of equation

(1). Initially, we simply consider the adoption timing of either business closures or stay-at-home

orders—the most common NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this exercise

are displayed in Table 2. The baseline specification only includes date and county fixed effects.


                                                                                               11
Subsequently, we control for the level of testing in the state, as well as mobility measured as the

median maximum distance traveled by county residents. COVID testing was inadequate in the

initial months after the outbreak and began to improve over our study period. Controlling for

testing allows us to account for any mechanical association between testing, infections, NPIs,

and COVID mortality. 15 Accounting for mobility allows us to capture the role played by any

endogenous self-distancing irrespective of whether the NPIs were in place. Regardless of the

model specification used, the speed of adoption of NPIs significantly curtails COVID-19 deaths.

Based on the estimates from the most complete model specification, we find that moving up the

implementation date of any of the NPIs (if both were adopted, whichever came first) by one day

lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent.16

         o gain a better understanding of which of the two most common NPIs matters the most,

we re-estimate the models including separate measures of adoption speed for each NPI. As can

be seen in Table 3, both measures seem to help curtail deaths. Adopting business closures one-

day earlier lowers COVID-19 deaths by 1.5 percent and, similarly, moving up the adoption of a

stay-at-home order by one day would curtail the COVID-19 mortality rate by 1.2 percent. 17

         Finally, in Table 4, we conduct several robustness checks to assess the sensitivity of our

findings to: (1) alternative measures of the NPI adoption speed; (2) the application of population

weights to derive nationally representative estimates; and (3) using different samples that

exclude New York and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New

Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) as potential

outliers during the period under analysis, or look at the Northeast region separately. In what

follows, we briefly refer to each robustness check.

        As noted earlier, the estimates in Table 2 use a contagion threshold equal to the first day-

to-day doubling of infections per capita in each county. In columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, we

experiment with different contagion thresholds: the first day infections per capita exceeded the

national average from January 21, 2020 to March 7, 2020 (column 1), and the first day infections

per capita exceeded the county average prior to any NPI adoption (column 2). 18 Our results

prove robust to the use of these alternative contagion thresholds. Accelerating the adoption

speed of the NPIs by one day lowers the COVID-19 mortality rate by 2 percent in column (1),

and by 4.4 percent in column (2).

        Next, we experiment with using population weights to derive nationally representative

estimates. As can be seen in column (3) of Table 4, we continue to find that speeding up the

adoption of the NPIs by one day would have significantly lowered mortality from COVID-19. In

this case by 4.6 percent, as opposed to 2.4 percent using the unweighted estimates of Table 2.

        Finally, we test the sensitivity of our findings across different geographic samples. First,

we exclude New York, which was the epicenter of the pandemic during the period under

consideration, to check if our results were driven by its presence in the sample. As can be seen

in column (4) of Table 4, the results are somewhat lower, but remain robust to this exclusion.

Speeding up NPI adoption by one day would have lowered the COVID-19 mortality rate by 2.2

percent. We next experiment with excluding the entire Northeast region of the country (column

5), as well as with focusing entirely on that region (column 6). As shown therein, the results

confirm our prior findings, underscoring the significance of NPIs in lowering mortality in the

18
  National infection rates between January 1 and March 7, 2020 averaged 7.30 infections per 100,000. The pre-NPI
county average infection rate was 1.83 infections per 100,000.


                                                                                                              13
Northeast. Specifically, speeding up the implementation of the NPIs by one day would have

lowered COVID-19 deaths by approximately 2 percent if we exclude the entire Northeast region.

However, in that region alone, deaths from COVID-19 would have dropped by 7.6 percent.

        In sum, the analyses in Table 4 confirm the robustness of our estimates presented Table 2

to alternative definitions of a contagion outbreak, to the use of population weights, and to

changes to the geographic scope of our sample. 19




6.      Identification

        An important caveat of the difference-in-difference approach adopted above refers to the

non-random adoption of NPIs. Given their implicit economic cost, counties are likely reticent to

impose social distancing, unless it is suspected that the health care system will be overwhelmed

as the death toll climbs. Luckily, from an inferential standpoint, if NPIs are implemented once

contagion has surpassed a threshold, the estimated impact of NPIs in curtailing COVID-related

deaths would likely represent a lower bound estimate of the true effectiveness of the adopted

measures if they were adopted in a timely manner. A related concern refers to endogeneity

biases stemming from unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, if the adoption of an NPI is

related to unobserved or unaccounted for factors, such as the county’s political ideology, which

may affect timely adoption of NPIs as well as cause laxity in the adoption of other measures,

including use of face masks or social distancing (Dave et al., 2020), the estimated impact of

NPIs might confound the impact of other unobserved factors.




19
  This is also true if we distinguish between business closures and stay-at-home orders, as shown in Table A in the
appendix.


                                                                                                                 14
       To address these endogeneity concerns, we conduct an event study. The latter allows us

to gauge if COVID-19 mortality trends already systematically differed across counties that

adopted NPIs earlier versus later, prior to the adoption of any NPI. In this manner, we address

concerns regarding pre-existing differential pre-trends across early- versus late-adopting

counties. Secondly, we are able to gauge if there is a clear break in the trend of COVID-19

mortality following the adoption of the NPIs. This enables us to dissipate concerns regarding the

confounding impact of unobserved and unaccounted for factors. Finally, we can examine the

dynamic impact of NPIs and assess if it makes sense based on how these policies reduce

infections and deaths. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

(2)    𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + ∑35
                      −35 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜌𝜌𝑐𝑐 + 𝜗𝜗𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐


       Equation (2) differs from equation (1) in that it includes leads and lags to the NPI

adoption timing, allowing us to examine the existence of pre-trends up to 35 days prior, as well

as dummies for up to 35 days after NPI adoption to learn about the impact of the implemented

policies. Figure 4 displays the coefficients from the event study corresponding to the most

complete model specification used in Table 2, along with 95 percent confidence intervals. All

estimates for the days preceding the adoption of the first NPI in the county are close to zero,

strongly supporting the assumption of no pre-trends. In addition, there is a clear break in the

trend in COVID-19 deaths approximately 4 weeks later—a common turn around period from

infection to recovery of most mild cases (Britt, 2020), staying down thereafter.

       Another concern regarding identification refers to the start of social distancing, as well as

the observance of business closures and stay-at-home orders. If residents in early-adopting

counties were already practicing self-distancing prior to the adoption of an NPI, its estimated

effectiveness in curtailing deaths would be biased upwards. (The opposite would be the case if,


                                                                                                 15
instead, that was predominantly the case among residents in counties that were late adopters of

NPIs—namely, the estimated impact of the NPI would be biased downwards). In addition, it is

important for the orders to have been observed by the public similarly across counties. If orders

were observed differentially in counties that were early- versus late-adopters, the estimated

impact of the NPI could also be biased. Fortunately, both concerns have been addressed by

recent research (e.g., Alexander and Karger, 2020) showing that county-level measures of

mobility declined sharply the day after stay-at-home orders went into effect, but not prior to their

implementation.        Furthermore, the authors find that responses to stay-at-home orders were

uniform across the country, and did not vary by income, political leanings, or urban/rural status.

Those findings reinforce the notion of no obvious self-distancing taking place prior to the

adoption of NPIs, as well as the obedient response to the mandated orders.


7.         Mechanisms

           According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the COVID-19 virus is

primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets emitted during coughing or

sneezing and through fomites in the environment around the infected person. 20 By reducing

close contact between individuals, the adoption of NPIs, such as business closures and stay-at-

home orders, may slow down the COVID-19 virus transmission and, therefore, deaths. In the

absence of vaccines and reliable tracking systems, NPIs have also been invoked to flatten the

pandemic curve by lowering the demands on public healthcare services, allowing for COVID-19

patients to be properly treated (Ferguson et al., 2020). As such, NPIs could have helped lower

COVID-19 mortality directly by reducing contagion, as well as indirectly by preventing

bottlenecks in the healthcare system.

20
     See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Spread.


                                                                                                 16
       As an attempt to sort out these two channels, we look first at COVID-19 infections. If the

effectiveness of the NPIs did not stem from reducing contagion but, rather, from avoiding an

overwhelmed healthcare system, we should not necessarily observe a reduction in the infection

rate. Yet, as displayed in columns (1) through (3) of Table 5, adopting one of the two types of

NPIs under examination one day earlier would have lowered infections by roughly 2 percent,

regardless of whether we use all counties, exclude New York or the entire Northeast region.

       We then look at how the early versus late adoption of NPIs might have affected non-

COVID mortality. If NPIs primarily helped curtail pandemic deaths by preventing the healthcare

system from becoming overwhelmed, non-COVID mortality rates should also be lower in those

regions where the NPIs were adopted earlier, as non-COVID patients could still be treated.

Based on the results in columns (3) through (6) in Table 5, while negative, the estimated

coefficients are either marginally significant at the 10 percent level or not statistically different

from zero. In other words, the response speed does not significantly alter non-COVID deaths, as

one would expect if preventing congestion of the healthcare system was a primary channel for

the reduction in COVID-19 mortality following NPI adoption. Thus, our estimates suggest that

excess deaths from non-COVID causes observed in other studies (e.g. Woolf et al. 2020) during

the period of our study were not the by-product of the adoption speed of NPIs.

       In sum, the results in Table 5 point to NPIs effectively reducing COVID-19 mortality by

curtailing contagion and the spread of the virus. These findings prove robust when we further

distinguish between business closures and stay-at-home orders, as displayed in Table B of the

appendix.


8.     Heterogeneous Impacts




                                                                                                  17
       To conclude, we examine if the relative adoption speed of NPIs impacted counties

differently based on other traits associated with either their adoption, or with the uneven impact

of the disease. Studies show that attitudes towards the efficacy of NPIs have been partisan, with

Republican governors and mayors being more reluctant to implement NPIs. It is also possible

that residents in majority-Republican counties with NPIs in place may be less compliant with

health care guidelines and recommendations. In Table 6, we first examine the differential impact

that the speed of NPI adoption had in Republican counties—measured as those with a

Republican vote share above 50 percent in the 2016 presidential election—given the role of

political partisan ideology in NPI adoption (Dave et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020). As can be

seen in column (1), adopting an NPI one day earlier lowers COVID-19 mortality in majority-

Republican counties by approximately 2.4 percent, whereas the reduction in other counties

reaches 5.4 percent. In other words, speeding up the implementation of NPIs in primarily

Republican counties would lower COVID-19 mortality by half the amount it would in non-

Republican counties. Why? Perhaps, NPIs are less strictly observed in Republican counties, in

which case, speeding up their implementation does not have the same bite as in other counties.

Note that descriptive statistics in Table 1 show that, according to our NPI speed measure,

Republican counties were more likely to be early adopters, largely on account of the late

outbreak of the pandemic in these counties.       Thus, our findings suggest that, despite the

advantage of learning from the experience of counties where the virus spread earlier, the NPIs

were less effective in these counties.

       Finally, we consider how the NPI effectiveness might have varied according to various

county-level traits known to be correlated to COVID-19 mortality due to the high-incidence of

the disease among the elderly and individuals with poor health. To that end, we first explore if



                                                                                               18
the adoption speed of NPIs particularly benefits localities with a higher share of individuals age

65 and older. As shown in column (2) of Table 6, we do not find that to be the case, although the

differential impact is only marginally statistically different from zero. This could possibly be

because most COVID-related elderly fatalities were in nursing homes, where the two NPIs we

are investigating might not have been as effective in reducing contagion. Residents of nursing

homes would require other measures limiting their potential exposure to the virus, such as

restrictions of visitors or the safe distancing of residents from each other.

       We then repeat the same exercise using other county-level traits reflective of the share of

the population that lack health insurance, are unemployed, or live below the federal poverty line.

We also look at the differential impact that speeding up the implementation of NPIs might have

in counties with higher comorbidity indexes. As shown in columns (3) through (6) in Table 6,

speeding up the implementation of NPIs does not appear to affect the death rate for COVID-19

any differently in counties with higher versus lower values of the abovementioned traits. To

some degree, this is not surprising given the aggregated nature of those traits. As such, the non-

significance of those demographic traits should be interpreted with caution.


9.     Summary and Conclusions

       The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise. In the absence

of a vaccine, and to halt the devastating impact of the pandemic on lives, several countries opted

for the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The United States was no different

in that regard, even though the response has been more fragmented and piecemeal.            Prior

research has shown the effectiveness of NPIs in curtailing deaths in the United States, Europe

and Asia. Our focus is on the importance of their timeliness, the mechanisms behind it, and the




                                                                                               19
heterogeneity of any effectiveness depending on the political ideology and degree of

vulnerability of counties.

       Using county-level data on COVID-19 mortality and infections, along with county-level

information on the adoption of stay-at-home orders and business closures, we examine how the

adoption speed of NPIs has affected COVID-19 mortality.            We find that moving up the

implementation date of NPIs by one day lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent. The

effectiveness of acting early is similar for both stay-at-home orders and business closures. An

event study addresses concerns regarding the endogeneity of NPI adoption, and robustness

checks show the results persist when introducing controls for testing and mobility, altering the

definition of adoption speed, weighting counties by population size, and considering different

geographic scopes. Finally, we confirm how the relevance of responding early stems from the

ability to slow contagion, which likely prevented the overburdening of the healthcare system.

We also find that NPI adoption speed has less relevance in Republican counties—a possible

byproduct of skepticism and reluctance to apply or fully comply with NPIs. In contrast, NPIs

appear similarly effective, and their speed of implementation equally as relevant, in counties

with distinct degrees of vulnerability to the disease, as captured by an index of comorbidity and

the share of residents without health insurance, unemployed, or living in poverty.

       While we await anxiously a vaccine or cure, NPIs remain the main mechanism to curtail

COVID-19 deaths. Gaining a better understanding of their timeliness and the importance of

responding early is essential, especially in the foreseeable occurrence of additional waves.

Notes: Statistics are reported at the county-level unless otherwise specified. These estimates are not weighted by population. Counties that never adopted an
NPI during our study period were assigned an uninformative NPI speed value to ensure these cases were preserved when estimating the model outlined in Eq. 1.
Our specification interacts NPI speed with a dummy indicative of the day a county adopted an NPI—effectively rendering this value zero for never adopters.
*p<.05 in t-test comparing value with Early Adopters.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. All regressions include a constant term. Standard errors are in parentheses and clustered at the county level. This table reports
the estimates from Equation (1) using daily COVID-19 deaths occurring between February 15, 2020 and April 23, 2020. In columns (1) and (2), we alter the definition
of contagion we used to measure the speed of adoption of a safer-at-home order and/or non-essential business closure (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐 ). Specifically, we replace our original
contagion threshold, which reflected the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita in a given county to (1) the first day infections per capita exceeded the
national average from January 21, 2020 to March 7, 2020 and (2) the county average infections per capita prior to NPI adoption, the results of which are found in
columns (1) and (2), respectively. In column (3), we apply population weights to derive nationally representative estimates. In columns (4), (5), and (6), we experiment
with using alternative samples to estimate Eq. (1). In column (4), we exclude New York from the analysis. In column (5), we exclude the entire Northeast region,

 Observations vary across specifications due to missing data. Column (1) uses information from 3,089 because 28 were missing information on election returns.
 Columns (3), (4), and (5) use information from 3,116 counties because one county was missing information on the number of residents without health insurance,
 unemployed, or living below the federal poverty line.

reports the estimates from Equation (1) using daily COVID-19 deaths occurring between February 15, 2020 and April 23, 2020. In columns (1) and (2), we alter the
definition of contagion we used to measure the speed of adoption of safer-at-home orders (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 ) and non-essential business closures (𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑐𝑐 ). Specifically, we
replace our original contagion threshold, which reflected the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita in a given county to (1) the first day infections per
capita exceeded the national average from January 21, 2020 to March 7, 2020 and (2) the county average infections per capita prior to NPI adoption, the results of
which are found in columns (1) and (2), respectively. In column (3), we apply population weights to derive nationally representative estimates. In columns (4), (5),
and (6), we experiment with using alternative samples to estimate Eq. (1). In column (4), we exclude New York from the analysis. In column (5), we exclude the
entire Northeast region, which consists of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.
In column (6), we focus exclusively on the Northeast region.
