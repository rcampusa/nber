I. Introduction

       Substantial job destruction occurs during aggregate contractions. Thanks
to pioneering work by Davis and Haltiwanger [1990 and 1992], data on job
destruction have made possible much more thorough investigation of its role. This
paper looks at one critical aspect of job destruction—its concentration during
brief periods, typically the most intense parts of cyclical contractions.
       I consider the following explanation of the temporal concentration of job
destruction: Production occurs in units such as plants. Owners decide each period
whether to continue or to shut down each unit by comparing a continuation value
to a shutdown value. During periods of calm, the difference—the net continuation
value—of some units drifts toward zero as these units depreciate physically or
become obsolete. They enter a zone of vulnerability to adverse shocks. When a
shock occurs, it clears out the zone of vulnerability. Until the zone begins to fill
up again through the normal diffusion of units across the spectrum of
productivity, another shock will have less effect. Thus a shock releases job
destruction that might otherwise have occurred earlier and also accelerates
destruction that would otherwise have occurred later. Job destruction is
concentrated in one episode.
       Temporal concentration arises when productive units are heterogeneous. I
describe the simplest possible model, of the type developed by Caballero and
Hammour [1996, 1998]; Caballero, Engle and Haltiwanger [1997]; and others,
and show that it results in concentration of episodes of job destruction and
inventory runoff. Data on job destruction and employment changes show
temporal concentration. On the other hand, the model suggests that job creation is




                                          2
a more persistent process, driven by the availability of unemployed workers. Data
on job creation support this prediction as well.



II. Concentrated Processes

       I define a concentrated process as one whose current value is likely to be
lower if its values over a span of time up to the recent past have been higher. Let
dt be a covariance-stationary series. I define its concentration function with lag
τ and window N to be

                                    E d t | d t −τ +L+ d t −τ − N +1
                       cτ , N = −                                    .          (2.1)
                                     1
                                          b
                                         d +L+ d t −τ − N +1
                                     N t −τ
                                                                     g
This is negative of the coefficient of the regression of dt on the lagged moving

average,

           N
             b                        g
             d t −τ +L+ dt −τ − N +1 . For a window one observation wide, the

concentration function is the negative of the autocorrelation function,

                                              Cov (d t , dt −τ )
                           φ t = − cτ ,1 =                       .              (2.2)
                                                  V (d )

A concentrated series has a concentration function with positive values. The
concentration function provides a way to determine the degree of concentration of
a series and a way to test for concentration. The reason for skipping the first τ − 1
lags will become apparent from some examples shortly.
       Concentration is also manifested in the three standard representations of
time series. First, as noted above, a concentrated series will generally have
negative autocorrelations except at the shortest lags. Second, in the moving




                                              3
average representation of a concentrated series, the coefficients on longer lags of
the innovation are negative. An innovation causes a unit increase in the series
when it occurs, but causes lower future values. For job destruction, an impulse
that causes destruction today means less destruction is likely in the future. Third,
in the autoregressive representation, the coefficients on longer lags of a
concentrated series are negative. Concentration could be detected and measured
by estimating an autoregressive-moving average process and then studying either
its moving-average or autoregressive representations. However, it appears that the
estimation of a full process with many parameters results in weaker tests than the
direct estimation of a well-chosen point on the concentration function. I will refer
to such a single value of the concentration function as a concentration coefficient.
       A concentration coefficient can be estimated as the negative of the

coefficient in the regression of dt on
                                                1
                                                N
                                                  b                    g
                                                  d t −τ +L+ dt −τ − N +1 . Its sampling

dispersion can be measured by the Newey-West robust standard error. The reason
for choosing a window of width N greater than one is, as usual, to reduce the
effect of sampling error. With very long series, or in situations where the
autocorrelations are known with certainty, it is appropriate to use N = 1 and thus
to study the autocorrelation function or correlogram. The correlogram is also
useful to diagnose concentration even when sampling variation is considerable.

A.     Concentration with a White-Noise Driving Force
       A simple example of a concentrated process is

                                         λ
                         dt − d = −
                                      1 − φL
                                            c           h
                                             dt −1 − d + ε t .                     (2.3)


Let




                                           4
                              Vt =
                                        1
                                     1 − φL
                                               c
                                            d − d t −1 , h                  (2.4)


interpreted as the stock of vulnerable jobs, which builds up during periods of
below-average job destruction. Then the model can be written as

                                   dt = λVt + ε t .                         (2.5)

Job destruction is more likely when the stock of vulnerable jobs is high.
       The correlogram for this process is:


                                   1 − φ 2 + φλ
                         φτ = −λ
                                   1− φ   2
                                              + 2φλ
                                                    bφ − λg
                                                           τ −1
                                                                .           (2.6)


The autocorrelations are negative, starting near −λ at lag 1 and falling in
magnitude at rate φ − λ for longer lags.

B.     Concentration with a Persistent Driving Force
       A more general model is

                                          bg
                               d t = − β L d t −1 + zt ,                    (2.7)


where β( L) embodies concentration and zt is moderately persistent. The driving
force zt might be a low-order moving average or an autoregressive process with
roots not too close to one in modulus. The dynamics of dt will reflect both those
of the driving process and of concentration.
       Consider an MA(1) process for the driving force,

                                          b        g
                                   zt = 1 + θL ε t ,                        (2.8)




                                              5
with θ ≤ 1 without loss of generality, together with the concentration specification
of the previous example,


                                                                λ
                                                  β ( L) =          ,                                            (2.9)
                                                             1 − φL

The left side of Figure 1 shows the correlogram for θ = 0.7.
        In the case of an AR(1) driving process, say

                                                            1
                                                  zt =          εt ,                                            (2.10)
                                                         1 − ψL

with ψ = 0.5, the resulting correlogram is shown on the right side of Figure 1,
with the same concentration specification.

Figure 1. Correlograms of Concentrated Processes with Moderately Persistent
Driving Processes
The left panel shows the autocorrelations when the concentration results from a
geometric lag process and the driving force is first-order moving average. The right panel
refers to the same situation except that the driving force is first-order serially correlated


        For both MA and AR driving processes, the resulting correlograms of the
series combining the driving process and the concentration effect have the shape




                                                           6
characteristic of a concentrated series except for the low-order correlations.
Estimation of a concentration coefficient with an appropriate lag τ should reveal
the effect of concentration even though it is obscured by the dynamics of the
driving process for the low-order coefficients.
       As these examples illustrate, the detection of concentration is most
effective if the lag, τ , is chosen just high enough to avoid contamination by the
short-run dynamics of the driving process, and the window width, N, is chosen not
so high as to extend the window into ranges where the concentration effect has
disappeared. In results reported later in this paper for U.S. job destruction, I use τ
= 6 quarters of lag and N = 4 quarters wide.



III. A Model of Shutdowns

       The model developed in this section embodies standard ideas about job
destruction and the life cycles of units—see my companion paper Hall [1999] for
a discussion of a fuller model and the related literature. All job destruction occurs
because of shutdowns. The purpose of the model is to make some simple points
about the behavior of job destruction, not to create a general equilibrium model of
recessions. In the model, there is a discrete set of alternative levels of profit that a
unit can earn. The concept of profit is the one suited to the decision-making unit,
which may or may not internalize all costs associated with job destruction (see
Hall [1999]). A new unit starts at the highest level, of profit, 1. With probability
δ each period, profit, zt , falls by a factor ω < 1:

                                 Pr[ zt = zt −1] = 1 − δ                          (3.1)


                                 Pr[ zt = ωzt −1 ] = δ .




                                           7
Each period, all units shut down that would otherwise be at or below a cutoff level

of profit zt* ; the cutoff level evolves as a stationary random variable. Shutdowns
define the flow of job destruction in the model. Upon shutdown, workers remain
idle for one period and then have a constant probability each period, f, of
employment at a new unit, which starts at the highest level of profit.
       Figure 2 shows 270 periods of history of job destruction from the model,
with the shutdown margin following an AR(2) process. Parameter values are:

Figure 2. Job Destruction from Model.


              The model generates occasional bursts of job destruction, during times
when the shutdown margin rises into a region of the current distribution of units
across categories where there are substantial numbers of vulnerable units. Figure
3 shows the correlogram of job destruction. For lags past the first, the
autocorrelation of job destruction is negative, showing that the series is
concentrated. With τ = 6 and N=4, the concentration coefficient is 0.198 with a
standard error of 0.039 (based on 1300 observations).

Figure 3 Correlogram of Job Destruction from Model.


           Employment dynamics depend on job creation as well as job destruction.
A simple view of job creation is that a job is always created when a qualified
worker encounters an employer. The model of this section embodies that view.
The flow of job creation is proportional to the number of unemployed workers
searching for new jobs. Job creation shares the highly persistent dynamics of
unemployment. Aggregate shocks have their immediate effect on job destruction
in the short run and only affect job creation through the cumulating stock of
searching workers.
           In the simple model, an impulse that results in a sharp spike in job
destruction causes a prolonged period of unemployment and job creation. Job
creation is a geometric moving average of job destruction, so the correlogram of
creation has much more positive serial correlation at short and medium lags.
Eventually, the concentration of job destruction shows through in negative serial

IV. Job Destruction in U.S. Manufacturing

           The Davis-Haltiwanger data break job destruction into components from
plant shutdowns and from employment reductions in plants that continue to
operate. The second type of job destruction includes the elimination of shifts and
the closing of productive units within plants, as well as reductions in staffing that
do not involve shutting down discrete units. Over the entire sample period, 1972-
88, 12 percent of total job destruction in manufacturing occurred because of plant
shutdowns. Plant-shutdown job destruction is more sensitive to aggregate shocks
than is the remainder of job destruction—shutdown destruction rose to 18.5
percent of total destruction in 1974, 21.3 percent in 1981, and 23.9 percent in




                                                         11
1986. Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh [1996, p. 29] report that another 44 percent
of destruction takes the form of employment reductions of 25 percent to 99
percent.
       Figure 5 shows job destruction from plant closings, seasonally adjusted, as
measured by Davis and Haltiwanger from the Longitudinal Research Database.
For details on the construction of the data, see Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh
[1996]. In brief, the database reports employment each quarter in a large random
sample of manufacturing plants. A closing is defined as a change to zero
employment. The series is calculated as the ratio of employment in all closed
plants in the quarter before closing to total employment in the sample.

Figure 6 Correlogram of Shutdown Job Destruction


             Figure 6 shows the correlogram of the shutdown job destruction rate. The
positive values for the first three lags appear to relate to the dynamics of the
driving force. The autocorrelations for lags 5 through 17 are negative, suggesting
considerable concentration. The concentration coefficient with lag 6 and width 4
is 0.395 with a standard error of 0.183, statistically unambiguous evidence of
concentration (p = 0.035).
             The data in Figures 5 and 6 relate to plant closings. The bulk of job
destruction arises not from plant closings but from events that cause employment
in a plant to shrink to levels still above zero. Shifts may be eliminated, units
within plants shut down, or there may be reductions in staffing without explicit
shutdowns. Although these decisions involve stronger interactions with other
influences than the decision to shut a plant, the character of the decision is the
same. In particular, all forms of job destruction should be concentrated for the
reasons discussed earlier in this paper.
             Figure 7 shows job destruction at continuing plants, seasonally adjusted,
as compiled by Davis and Haltiwanger. This component of job destruction also
tends to concentrate in bursts, such as in 1982 and 1975.

       Figure 8 shows the correlogram of job destruction at continuing plants.
Again, the first few autocorrelations are positive, presumably reflecting the short-
run dynamics of the driving force. At lag 5, they turn negative and remain
consistently negative through lag 18. The concentration coefficient with lag 6 and
width 4 is 0.285 with a standard error of 0.228, reasonable but not statistically
unambiguous evidence of concentration (p = 0.217). A longer window would
probably result in a nominally stronger finding, but the test is hard to interpret if it
is based on a preliminary inspection of the correlogram.

Figure 9. Job Creation Rate in U.S. Manufacturing


       Figure 9 shows job creation in U.S. manufacturing as measured by Davis
and Haltiwanger. There is no doubt that job creation reaches its highest levels
around the time that unemployment reaches its maximum during a recession,




                                          15
usually a few quarters after the initial shock. On the other hand, in some
recessions, notably in 1975, job creation falls sharply, contrary to the simple
model. But the correlogram in Figure 10 shows that the model’s predictions about
concentration of job creation are consistent with the data. There is no systematic
tendency for the autocorrelation of job creation to turn negative after a few
quarters.

VI. Concentration of Employment Changes

             In the simple model, most of the short-run dynamics of employment come
from job destruction. Data on job destruction and creation are generally consistent
with this view, though creation has more short-run movements than is strictly
consistent with proportionality of creation and unemployment. Nonetheless, it
seems reasonable to expect to find concentration in employment changes, which




                                                     16
are the negative of the difference between job destruction and creation. Figures 11
and 12 show the correlograms of the log-changes in employment in durables
manufacturing and non-durables.

       Concentration is pronounced in durables and is statistically unambiguous.
The concentration coefficient for lag 6 and window width 4 is 0.277, with a
standard error of 0.10 (p value of 0.006). Though the correlogram for non-
durables shows signs of concentration, the evidence is ambiguous: the coefficient
is 0.172 with a standard error of 0.147 (p value of 0.243).



VII.   Concluding Remarks

       A simple model of heterogeneous jobs has a sharp testable implication:
The flow of job destruction should have the econometric property of
concentration. The likelihood of additional job destruction falls below normal a
few quarters after a spike of job destruction. On the other hand, job creation tracks
the stock of unemployed workers, and creation is more persistent than is
destruction. Data from the U.S. manufacturing sector supports these predictions.
