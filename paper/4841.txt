       The purpose of the paper is to measure the potential bias in the U.S. import price index

due to the appearance of new product varieties, or new foreign suppliers, and determine the effect

of this bias on the estimated income elasticity of import demand. Existing import price indexes

are based on a sampte of products from importing firms. We argue that if the share of import

expenditure on the sampled products is falling over time, this will lead to an upward bias in the

measured index. Using a correction based on the falling expenditure share on sampled counthes,

we find that the income elasticity of aggregate U.S. import demand is reduced from 2.5 to 1.7.

or about halfway to unity. Our estimates suggest that the aggregate import price index is upward

biased by about one and one-half percentage points annually.

1. Introduction
        Since the work of Houthakker and Magee (1967). it has been known that
estimates of the income elasticity or demand for imports to the United States
(and to other industrialized countries) are substantially greater than unity. Since
these estimates exceed roreign country's income elasticity of demand for our
products, the implication is that balanced world growth will lead to an automatic
worsening in the U.S. trade balance. Dissatisfaction with this result has led a
number of researchers to suggest that there is an upward bias in the import price
indexes and income elasticity estimates, due to the omission of neW product
varieties,   or new roreign suppliers of existing products.1 According to this

argument, over the past several decades the U.S. has experienced an expansion in

the   range of imports from rapidly growing, developing countries, but no
corresponding decrease in import prices. As a result, the rising share of imports
- Which IS correlated with rising U.S. income - is attributed to a high income
elasticity in the import demand equation.
        Helkie and Hooper (1968) attempt to correct the estimation of aggregate
U.S. import demand by including a measure of foreign country's capital stocks, as
a proxy reflecting their movement into new product     tines.   It would be preferable

to    incorporate these import varieties from new supplying countries directly into
the import price index, and then estimate the effect on the income elasticity.
Drawing on the results in Feenstra (1994), we describe in section 2 how the
appearance of new product varieties, or new suppliers of existing products. could
bias the import prices indexes. The major purpose of the paper is to measure this
bias over the at! U.S. imports, and then determine the effect of this bias on the
estimated income elasticity of import demand.
         To obtain the import price indexes, the Division of International Prices.
Bureau or Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys importing firms, as described in
Alterman (1991). For firms included in these surveys, interviews are conducted
to determine the prices or imported goods whose quality characteristics are
unchanged over time: we refer to these as 'sampled products' and sampled
prices.' These interviews necessary exclude some products from sampled firms.
and other importing firms entirely.   In section 2. we argue that if the share or
import expenditure on the sampled products is talking over time, this will lead to
an upward bias in the measured index.
      The entry of countries into new product lines is one reason to expect that
the expenditure on sampled products may be falling, though this can also reflect a
more rapid fall in prices from the new suppliers. Both of these hypotheses are
consistent with the 'product cycle theory of international trade (Vernon. 1966).
whereby production of commodities will shift over time to the lowest-cost
locations. Thus, the appearance of new suppliers can quite possibly lead to an
upward bias in the import price index. This idea is related to the potential bias
in the consumer price index due to the appearance of new retail outlets offering
lower prices (Reinsdorf, 1993). Our paper can be viewed as an international
analog to this domestic argument, with new foreign suppliers taking the place of
new retail outlets.
      In section 3, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to three issues:
the functional form of the aggregator: the absence of multinational firms; and the
availability of firm-level data. While the basic results are derived for a con-
stant elasticity of substitution (CES) aggregator function, we show that similar
results can be obtained for the translog case, so the choice of aggregator is not
crucial. On the other hand, the results are very sensitive to the assumption that
the international transactions being considered are at arms-length. i.e. these are
not transactions internal to a multinational firm. Since Imports internal to the
firm are prevalent in some industries, as we describe, the results concerning the
                                                                                           3


bias are not     expected   to hold in these cases.

         The   third issue of concern is the availability of data; the correction to the
OLS price index described in section 2 relies on having data for the expenditure on
products sampled from each importing firm. This information is not currently
collected on a continual basis. Accordingly, we are forced to rely on country-
level rather than firm-level data. That is. instead of using the expenditure share
on sampled products, we will be using the expenditure on all products from
sampled countries. These import expenditures are obtained from the U.S. Bureau
of the Census. Thus, we are relying on the Census data to construct proxies (or
the theoretically correct adjustment to the BLS indexes, which would rely on
rirmâ€”level data. The usefulness of these proxies will be judged by their
statistical significance when included in import demand equations.
         In section 4. we examine how the adjustments to the import prices indexes
affect   the   income elasticity of demand for aggregate U.S. imports. The inclusion
of the foreign capital stock proposed by Helkie and Hooper lowers the income
elasticity of import demand from about 2.5 to 2.2. In comparison, using the
correction based on the falling expenditure share on sampled countries, we find
that the income elasticity is reduced from 2.5 to 1.7, or about hallway to unity.
Our estimates suggest that the aggregate import price index is upward biased by
between one and two percentage points annually. We conclude our paper by making
a simple recommendation on the collection of additional data by the BLS when it
interviews firms.

2. Potential Bias In the Import Price Index
         To motivate our analysis, consider the case of new    retail   outlets for
domestic goods. Reinsdorf (1993) argues that very similar products will sell at
different prices across retail outlets, and cites Denison (1962) to suggest that
                                                                                              4


these price differentials are due to time lags needed for consumers to respond to
the price information, rather than quality differentials across retail outlets.
These new retail outlets are linked into the consumer price index without directly
incorporating the price differential, resulting in an potential upward bias in the
index.    In order to model this bias, it is essential to assume that the similar

goods    are imperfect substitutes across   the retail outlets. This reflects the

empirical   observation that a lower price at one outlet does not eliminate       demand

for    the same good at another outlet. Reinsdorf and Moulton (1994. sec. V) put
further   structure on the imperfect substitutes assumption by assuming that the

good    has a constant elasticity of substitution across    the retail outlets.

         We will be taking the same approach to modeling the choice       of a U.S. firm

to    import a product from various possible foreign suppliers. That is. we will
assume that the U.S. importer treats the product as imperfect substitutes across
the foreign suppliers, reflecting any quality differentials across the suppliers, as
well as differences in their time lags of delivery, ease of communication.
reliability of supply, etc. That is, even when observed quality differentials are
absent, we will suppose that the wholesale services provided by the various
foreign suppliers are enough to differentiate them from the buyers point of view.
We should stress that the buyer in our case is the U.S. importer rather than the
U.S. consumer,    since the latter may be entirely unaware of     these   differences in
wholesale services by the various suppliers. We feel that this assumption of

imperfect    substitution across foreign supplier is analogous to that made for

domestic retail outlets, provided    that the   import   in question is an arms-length
transactions between two unrelated firms.        In contrast, the import of a product

by a multinational from its own production facility abroad would not          fit into this
framework, and will have to be treated separately.
                                                                                                       S



2.1 CES Index
       Like Reinsdorf and Moulton (1994. sec. V). we will also assume the buyer
treats the product as having a           constant    elasticity of   substitution (CES) across   the

various supplying firm. This assumption is made for tractability, though we wilt
argue in the next section that similar results could be obtained under alternative
specifications. With this assumption, the minimum cost of                  obtaining   one unit of
services    from   the foreign suppliers i of some product are given by:



                          I                  (1â€”e)\1(1â€”Ã¸)
               c(pt.lt) :1           bipit                  .   0> 1.                      (1)
                              i(lt               )

where C denotes the elasticity of substitution, which we assume exceeds unity:
Itch        N} is the set of foreign suppliers in period t with prices Pit >0. itlt:
Pt denotes the corresponding vectors of prices in period t; and b>0 denotes a

quality    (or taste) parameter for the product from supplier i.
          Several features of the CES function in (1) should be noted. First, we have
treated each Foreign firm as supplying a single variety i or the differentiated
product. Multiproduct firms can be handled, however, by letting i index each
variety supplied by each firm. Thus, we will sometimes refer to i as an index of
product varieties, where it is understood that this can be across firms or across
products within a firm. Second, we have treated the quality parameters bi as
constant over time in (1). This is not essential, and we could alternatively
allow these parameters to change. In that case, we would assume that the
 qualityâ€”adjusted price is correctly measured for products that the BLS samples:
that is. movements in b are correctly evaluated for the sampled products. For
the non-sampled products, movements in b will not affect our results below,
since we will use the expenditure shares to evaluate the (unobserved) prices and
                                                                                                   6


these shares would also respond to any changes in quality (Feenstra. 1994).
          To briefly review known results, suppose that the same set of product
varieties I are available in periods tâ€”1 and t. and that the amounts purchased of
each variety, x_ and x, are castâ€”minimizing quantities for the prices Pt-i and
Pt, respectively. Let at_iCI) and st(l) denote the corresponding expenditure shares:

                              a PitXit/ PitXit                                           (2)
                                         Id



As   in Diewert (1976), the exact price index P[pti ,pt,st_i(l).st(lfl is defined as a
function of     observed   prices and expenditure shares, such that,

                      c(pt, l)/c(pt_i .1)      P[pt_j .pt.tâ€”i (I),St(l)].                (3)


The important feature of (3) is that the price index itself does not depend on the
unknown parameters b, i ci. From Sato (1976) and Vartia (1976), a formula for
the exact price index corresponding to the CES unit-cost (unction is:

                1pti .Pt.tâ€”1 (l)st(II]                              U
                                              ri (Pit/pitâ€”i )Wit(                       (4a)
                                              iii
This is a geometric mean of the individual price changes, where the weights
wit (I)   are computed using the cost shares sit(1) in the two periods, as follows:




                â€”    sit(l) â€”sitâ€”i (I)                itO) â€”sitâ€”i (I)
       wit(I)
                = (lnsit(l) - lnsjti l)                                                 (4b)
                                              / I (insitw - lnsit;WJ

The numerator on the right of (4b) is the logarithmic               mean of sitU) and sit_i (I).
and lies between these cost shares. Then the weights wt(l) are a normalized

version    of the logarithmic means, and add up to unity.2
       The exact price index in (4) requires that the same varieties are available
                                                                                        7



in the two periods, and that the prices for all these products are sampled. We
now show how the exact index can be computed when only a subset of the product
varieties are sampled. To this end, suppose that          and l are the full sets o(
imported products, and that l,(It flIt-i). 110. is sampled in both periods. We
shall let P(pti,pt,st_i(I),st(I)) denote the price index in (3) that is computed by
using data on only this set. We shall refer to this as a conventlonal' price index,
in the sense that it is computed over a constant set of (sampled) products. The
exact price index should equal the ratio c(pt,It)/c(pt_i .ltâ€”i). Our first result,
proved in Feenstra (1994). shows how this can be measured with observed prices
and quantities:


Proposition 1
Ear any setof sampled products lc(Itfllt_i), Ito, the exact price index for the
CES aggregator 5:

      c(pt,lt)/c(pti .lt-i)      P(ptj,pt,sti(l),st(I)]

where X(I)1       Pirir          PirXir, far rrt-1,t.                        (5)
                          itt,

      This result states that the exact price index equals the conventional index
P(pt_i,pt,sti(l),st(l)], times an additional term that represents the bias in the
convehtional index. To interpret this term, note that X(l)t equals the fraction of
expenditure on sampled products in period t. relative to the entire set it It.
Thus. [X(I)t/x(I)t_i) is the ratio of expenditure on sampled products over the two
periods. U this ratio is less than unity, reflecting a declining share of expen-
diture on the sampled products, then the exact price index will be tower than the
index P[pti .pt.5ti (l).st(I)). In other words, the declining share of expenditure on
the sampled products wilt Lead to an upward bias in the conventional index.
                                                                                             a


         A declining share or expenditure on the sampled products could be due to the
appearance of new suppliers, or alternatively, to a fall in the relative price of
products not included in the sample. Both of these hypotheses are consistent with
the product cycle theory or international trade (Vernon. 1966), whereby
production or commodities will shift over time to the lowest-cost locations.
Thus, the appearance of new suppliers can quite possibly lead to an upward bias in
the import price index. The potential bias in the conventional index is measured
by the change in the share of expenditure on the sampled products, raised to the
power 1 1(0-i). For example, if new suppliers are providing products that are a
perrect    substitute for existing products, so that C     approaches infinity, then there
would be no bias in the existing index. Conversely, if C is low (but stilt greater

than unity), any given change in the relative expenditure on sampled products will

indicate a greater bias in the conventional index.3


2.2   BLS Index
         The BLS samples multiple varieties of a       product within each 10-digit
Harmonized System (HS) category, and then constructs the index at that level.

More precisely, given the   ratio of   prices in the   two timeâ€”periods for each sampled
product, the BLS constructs an unweighted arithmetic mean of these prices in the

10â€”digit HS category: aggregation to broader industry levels then occurs with a

Laspeyres    formula. The use of an    arithmetic rather than geometric mean will

result   in some upward bias in the index, and the absence of weights in the index
may also introduce some error. In addition to these, we can use Proposition 1 to
determine the potential upward bias in the BLS index if the sampled products have
expenditure shares that are falling over time.                              -

         Note that Proposition 1 holds even if the set I used to construct the
conventional index price index P contains only a single variety, so that Ir(i}. In
                                                                                             9


this case the conventional index is simply the price ratio for that single variety.
                    while the term X1(i)=s11 measures that observed expenditure share on

that variety. Then taking the geometric mean of (5) of all the sampled product
varieties 1:1          N. it follows that the exact price index equals,


        c(pt.lt)/c(pt_i .'t-i) fl (Pit/Pit-i )i/N (            f                    (6)


The unweighted arithmetic mean used by the BLS exceeds the simple geometric
mean appearing in (6). We then obtain:


Corollary 1
The BLS index is related to the exact price index by:

           N                     N
                                              i/N
                    (Pit/pii) infl
                1




           Ri

                                  (c(pt,lt)/c(pti .lt-i)] fl(sit/siti 1   /1)   ,




        The final term on the right of (7) is the average decline in the expenditure
shares on products sampled by the BLS. When these shares are declining, there is
an upward bias in the measured index as compared to the exact index. This bias

reflects   either the inferred price decline on firms not sampled by       the BLS, or the

appearance      of new product varieties. If we suppose that the newest suppliers â€”
not yet in the 8LS sample - also have the most rapidly rising shares, then this
upward bias is a plausible        outcome. The data used to measure this potential bias

is   discussed in the next section, after first reviewing the sensitivity of our
results to assumptions we have made.
                                                                                       10


3. Sensitivity of Results
3.1 Functional Form
      The results above were derived under the assumption of a CES aggregator
function, and it is important to determine how sensitive the results are to this
choice. Suppose instead that the product varieties i enter into a translog
aggregator function, so that the unit-cost function (1) is rewritten as:

              Inc(pt,I) o      +
                                   oi

with oj>Q    and          The set I in this definition refers to the universe   of

possible product varieties, and is not allowed to vary. For products that are not

available   in some period, their reservations prices must be used on the right of
(8). which are generally finite (see below). This contrasts with the CES case in
(1), where the reservation prices were infinite, and products not availabte would
simply not appear in the unitâ€”cost function. Summing over this universe of
products,   the unit-cost function is homogeneous of degree one in prices provided

n is not available.
      Our goat is to determine how the translog aggregator would affect the
results in Proposition 1. To this end, we suppose that variety n is not included in
the set of sampled varieties in either period. This mau be because variety n is
new, or because it is available in both periods but not sampled. In either case.
let l/(n}E(iiLI and ixn} denote the set of sampled products. Then the change in
the price of variety n between the two periods can be computed from (9) as:


                                                                                   (11)
             tn(â€”) (srtrsnt.i)          ici/(n}      in(t)

Then the expression on the right of (11) is a weighted average of the change in
prices of all goods ixn.   Then (11) states that the change in the price of good n.
relative to a weighted average of the prices of other varieties, is proportional to
the change in the expenditure share on variety n.         Note that this expression
continues to hold if variety n is not available in one (or both) of the periods, in
which case its share is set at zero in (11).
      To determine the impact of the non-sampled variety on unit-costs, we use
the result that the ratio of unitâ€”costs for the translog function equals a Divisia
index of the changes in the individual prices (e.g. Diewert, 1976):

      ln(c(pt.lt)/c(pti it-i)]             (sit-I +sjt)In(ptt/pt..i) .             (12)

When variety n is newly available in period t, then its reservation price (10) is
used on the right of (12) in period tâ€”1. To determine the effect of omitting
variety n from the price index in both periods, we substitute (11) into (12).

           This result states that the exact index equals the sum of two terms: Ci)
a Divisia index constructed over the sampled products iei/(n}, where the shares 'jr
in this index reflect the optimal choice ii variety n was not available: and (ii) a
term reflecting the change in the expenditure share on variety n. and its average
elasticity of demand. As a proof, note that from (9) the elasticity of demand for
variety n in period t is tint          4,nIsnt). Then the following term appears when
(11) is substituted into (12):

                            1            '5nr5nt-1

                                                            â€”



where    11n   1   -(2b'nn/(snt_i 'snt)] is the elasticity of demand computed with the

average share between periods t-1 and t. This establishes part (a).

        To establish (b). let Pnr denote the observed price for variety n and Pnr its

reservation        price.   Holding all other prices fixed, it is immediate from (9) that

ln('nr/pnr):_snr/nn. Substituting this change in prices into the share equation
                                                                                       13


(9) for 5ir. it follows that ir is the implied expenditure on variety i when n is
not available. The shares ijr are not generally observed, which is a limitation of
Proposition 2. However. if the varieties icl/(n} are weakly separable from n.
then a change in the price of variety n (from its observed to reservation level),
should have no impact on the relative expenditure share (or varieties iel/(n}. In
that case, the formula for the shares in (2) â€” which simply omits variety n from
the calculation - would equal ijr, so that the Divisia index in Proposition 2 can be
readily measured.
      The condition that the products iel/{n} are weakly separable from n is
rather special, and mare so because we have already assumed that nn<0 (so that
the reservation price is finite). The latter condition means that the higher-level
function defined over the aggregate icl/ln} and variety n must be translog but not
Cobb-Douglas. However, this implies that the lower-levet function used to
aggregate the varieties iU/(nl must be Cobbâ€”Douglas. in order for the resulting
unit-cost function to be translog.4 Thus, the varieties iel/(n} will have constant
relative shares. The special nature of this separability assumption is perhaps no
worse than the CES case, however, as it is the only function for which every
subset of goods is weakly separable from every other. Indeed, it appears to be
this separability property, rather than the infinite reservation prices, that makes
the analysis of new and non-sampled goods so tractable in the CES case.
      In order to compare the translog and CES cases, let us continue to assume
that there is a single non-sampled variety n.5 Then from Proposition I the exact
price index in the CES case is:

                                                                      iâ€”sot

                          = lnP[pt_i .pt,sti (I),st(t)) â€”                     (13)
                                                                     J,

where the second tine follows if the expenditure share on the non-sampled good is
smalt. so that ln(1 -snr)=-snrâ€¢ Comparing (13) to Proposition 2. we obtain:


Corollary 2
If variety n is not sampled, then the ratio of the bias in the conventional index
for the transtog and CES cases is approximately:


                                     (     1 if ii'n:d.
                           (- J 4 = 1/2 if 5nt-1 O and TInt
                                         . a as both 5nt- and nt"Â°'

         To interpret the first result above, note that the elasticity of demand for
variety n in the CES case is ci(1 â€”snt)'snt. For small values of 5nt this is close to
c, so that if the average elasticity of demand in the translog case equals that in
the CES case, then the bias terms are approximately equal. This comparison
depends, however, on computing the elasticity of demand un using the average
share (snt_jsnt)/2, Alternatively, if     variety   n is newly available in period t   SO

that    SnI_irO, then the bias term in Proposition 2 is written as snt/2(flntâ€”1) for

1'tnt   I ('nn'5nt)' With Ttnt. this is about oneâ€”half the bias in the conventional

index   snt /Ca-i) obtained in the CES case. Since these bias terms can also be
interpreted as the welfare gain due to the introduction of the new product
variety, we have shown that this gain is approximately twice as large in the CES
case (with qnt). Finally,       the last resutt above indicates that these com-

parisons are quite sensitive to the share of the nonâ€”sampled good:        if this share
approaches zero, then the elasticity of demand ij'n for the     translog case approaches

infinite,   so the ratio of the biases approaches zero.
                                                                                              15


         White Corollary 2 summarizes the quantitative relation between the biases,
an immediate qualitative result From comparing (13) and Proposition 2 is that for
both the CES and trans log unit-cost functions, a decease (increase) in the share of
the sampled products indicates an upward (downward) bias in the conventional
price index. This result does not rely on the approximation in (13), but simply
uses the fact that both 0>1 and ifn>1 (since Wnn<O). Thus, the qualitative nature
of the bias identified in Corollary 1 â€” that sampling From firms with a falling
expenditure share on their products will lead to an upward bias in the index â€” is
preserved across these two functional forms, though the magnitude of the bias
will depend on the elasticities of substitution and demand as discussed in
Corollary 2.

3.2 Multinational Firms
         An assumption maintained through our discussion is that the quantity
purchased from foreign firms by the U.S. importer is costâ€”minimizing at the
observed prices. This assumption fails to hold, however, when the import is
internal to a multinational firm, in which case the transfer price for the import
may bear little relation to its economic value. Thus, for these internar imports
we   should not expect the bias we have identified in the conventional index to

apply.    This conclusion is   reinforced by the observation that imports internal to a

firm   may not be differentiated across sources of supply: a U.S. multinational

engaged in production abroad at two different plants may very well treat the
products from these sources as perfect substitutes. Thus, our other maintained

assumption -     that   imports are differentiated across Foreign sources -   also   fails.


         Data on intra-cornpany imports are presented in Table 1 and 2.       In Table 1.

we distinguish U.S. manufacturing imports that are internal to U.S. multinationals
(shipped from nonbank U.S. affiliates abroad), and those that are internal to
                                                                                      is

foreign multinationals (shipped to nonbank foreign affiliates in the U.S.).   In

addition, we distinguish imports that are intended for sate to consumers
(wholesale trade) from those that are intended as inputs into further production
(manufacturing imports). The most precise data â€” dealing with shipments from a
company abroad to the same company in the U.S. - are available from a 1982 or
1987 benchmark survey.
      For U.S. multinationals, the intra-company manufacturing imports amounted
to $25.4 billion in 1962, or 14% of total nonâ€”petroleum merchandise imports.6
Of this, $1 0.6 billion was accounted for by transportation imports from Canada,
reflecting the Canadaâ€”U.S. auto pact. We have listed the three largest source
countries, which were Canada, Japan and Mexico. There was an additional $2.3
billion or intra-company imports classified as wholesale trade, bring total intraâ€”
company trade from U.S. affiliates abroad to 15% of imports. Turning to the
foreign multinationals with operations in the U.S.. the internal manufacturing
imports of these firms amounted to $17.8 billion in 1981. or 5% of total
imports. The three largest source countries are Japan. Germany and Canada. A
much larger amount of imports - $65.1 billion or 23% of the total - occurs in
wholesale trade.7 The bulk of this wholesale trade was from Japan. much of
which is explained by wholesale trade in autos (such as Toyota Motor Corporation
sending its vehicles to Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A). in total, the intra-company
trade of U.S. and foreign affiliates is roughly oneâ€”half of total imports.
      More detailed evidence for individual industries is provided in Table 2.
which covers only the U.S. affiliates of foreign multinationals, and their internal
imports in manufacturing.8 The classification of industries is that used by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). and the industries are ranked according to the
share of internal (i.e. intraâ€”company) imports in total imports. At the top of the
ranking are chemicals and primary metals, followed by industrial machinery.
                                                                                         17


household audio equipment, and various food products. The average of the internal
manuFacturing imports for the entire sample is 8%.
         The borderline industry in Table 2 is motor vehicles and equipment, where
the internal manufacturing imports are 7% of the total. Given the extremely
large amount or wholesale internal imports in this industry, we ranked it as
aboveâ€”average in internal imports, and the same holds for all industries listed
above motor vehicles and equipment in Table 2. Conversely, all industries listed
below are treated as below-average in their internal imports.9 More specifically,
for those industries with the internal imports share exceeding 0.08 in Table 2
(including motor vehicles and equipment), we identiFied the corresponding 3-digit
Standard industrial Trade Classification (SITC) numbers. Excluding petroleum
products, there are roughly two hundred 3-digit SITC categories, of which about
one-half corresponded to those industries listed in Table 2 with above-average
internal imports; the other half are treated as having below-average internal
imports.      Given this crude division of our sample, our hypothesis is that the bias
in the conventional import price index should be more prominent for the industries
with belowâ€”average internal imports.


3.3 A va/lability of Data
         The potential bias in the BLS import price index is measured by the last
term appearing in Corollary 1, i.e. the change in expenditure shares on sampled
products. An immediate difficulty with implementing this formula is that the
expenditure   shares on the sampled products are not collected on a continual basis

by the BLS. While expenditure information is used to form an initial sample, once

a product has been selected for a price interview, the firm is no longer asked to

report   the expenditure on that product. For this reason, we have relied on certain
proxies for this bias term, constructed from disaggregate import data available
                                                                                        18


 from the U.S. Bureau or the Census, over 1978-88. The Census import data is
 reported according to the Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUSA)
 classification, which includes over 10.000 categories annually. The extremely
 disaggregate nature   of this data set makes it useful source for constructing

expenditure   shares on imports.

       We will consider two proxies for the bias term in Corollary 1. The first
replaces the firm-level expenditure shares with the corresponding country-level
expenditure shares in the same product category. That is. for each 3-digit SIIC
industry, we obtained from BLS a list of the countries from which price data was
actually collected. This information was obtained for the interviews conducted
at two dates - September. 1982 and March, 1985. We also need to make some
assumption about what interviews occurred in other years. In the absence or
other information, we will assume that the country-product interviews used in
the 1982 interviews remained constant over the period 1978-83, and that the
country-product interviews used in the 1985 interviews remained constant over
the (overlapping) period 1983-88.
      To describe the first proxy, suppose that the BLS obtained from information
on product i imported rrom country k(i), in years t- I and t. We have used Sj      in
Corollary I to denote the share or expenditure on product i, relative to all
imports in that product category.1 0 We only have information on the countries
sampled from at the 3-digit SITC level, so we construct the bias at that level.
Letting 5k(t) denote import share of country k(i) at the 3â€”digit SITC level, our
first proxy ror the bias term appearing in Corollary 1 is:


              SHARE1 r fl[sk(i)t/sk(i)t-1]        fl(skt'skt-l ) .          (14)


where this term is constructed for each 3-digit SITC industry.
                                                                                         19



      To obtain (14), we simply replace the product share sjt in Corollary 1 with
the country shares 5k(i)tâ€¢ We have also omitted the elasticity term 11(0-1)
which appears as a power on the bias in Corollary 1. since this wilt be estimated
when we include (14) as a variable in an import demand equation (as described in
the next section). Note that the share of country k is repeated each time an
import product i (within the same 3-digit SITC category) is interviewed from
that country. Then letting k denote the share of interviews within each 3-digit
SIIC for products coming from country k (which was provided to us by      the BLS).

the second   equality in (14) is obtained.

      Our    second measure of the potential bias is closely related to the first, but
uses inFormation on the detailed TSUSA level products supplied by each country.
In particular, a country that supplies in more TSUSA categories over time can be
judged to have increasing product variety in its exports to the U.S. The expected
impact of greater product variety would be to reduce the expenditure share jt on
each variety supplied by individual firms.    In the absence of having firmâ€”level
data, we can evaluate these changes in product variety be computing the country
share 5k(i) over only those TSUSA categories that country k supplies continuously.
That is. for each 3-digit SITC category and each source country, we identified the

TSUSA products supplied every year in the sub-periods 1978-83 and 1983-88. Then
we calculated the expenditure on these TSUSA products, relative to all U.S.
imports tn the same 3-digit SITC industry: this expenditure share is denoted by
     which is less than the country share 5kt by construction. Greater product
variety from country k will mean that         Falls relative to 5kt Our second
measure of the potential bias is then:


                     SHARE21 flst/stit ,                                     (15)

w here
                                                                                        20


        sct .S 5k1    denotes the expenditure on TSUSA products that country k

          supplies   continously over 1978-83 or   1983-88. relative to total U.S.

          imports    in the same 3-digit SITC category.

      We expect that SHARE2 would be a bettor measure of the potential bias than
SHARD, because it takes into account changes in product variety from each
country. A Limitation of SHARE2 occurs, however, when the names of the TSUSA
categories change over time, as they do in response to product innovations or
changes in U.S. trade laws.1 1     For example, as televisions of increased variety
were imported into the United States, the ISUSA categories have adjusted to
reflect this (distinguishing color versus black and white, and size of screen). If
a TSUSA category is split during our sample period, then we count that product as
not continuously supplied, and ignore it in the calculation of 4. In principle, our
calculation   is robust to these changes in ISUSA names: if a product with a fixed

percentage of    country k export sales (within    some 3-digit SITC industry) is
omitted from the calculation of s' and              because its TSUSA category split,
this would have no impact on the ratio (s't/3u-i ). However, when many of these
changes in product names occur, then this ratio is calculated over a very small
number of (continuously supplied) TSUSA products.1 2 In that case, we might
expect SHARE2 to display more erratic behavior than SHARE1. In general, we wilt
judge the usefulness of these two proxies by their significance in regressions of
import demand, as described in the next section.

4. U.S.   Import Demand

      We will follow Helkie and Hooper (1988) in specifying a Tog-linear equation
ror aggregate U.S. imports:

              lnomt         .
                                1lnP $2lnPdt . lnY + t ,
                                       +                                        (16)
                                                                                        21


where 0m1 is real non-petroleum imports. mt is the aggregate import price index
(based an the OLS interviews), dt is the U.S. GNP deflator, and Y is nominal
GNP. Since demand should be homogeneous of degree zero in prices and income, we
can impose the constraint ( +$2.flj)rO on (16) and rewrite it as;

                lr)Omt o + $ lnCPmt/Pdt) + 3ln(Yt/Pdt) + q .                   (17)

which is the form usually estimated.
        In the first row of Table 3. we show the results of estimated (17) with
quarterly data over the period 1979:1 to I 968:IV. In addition to the variables in
(17). Helkie and Hooper include a measure of capacity utilization (in the U.S.
relative to that abroad). The coefficients of the relative import price follow a
second-order polynomial with eight quarterly lags, real GNP includes one quarterLy
lag, and the equation is estimated with firstâ€”order autocorrelation, The long-run
income elasticitu is estimated at 2.5.13 Helkie and Hooper use an average of
foreign countries capital stock (relative to the U.S. capital stock) as a
determinant of their ability to move into new product lines. In the second
regression in Table 3, this relative foreign capital stock lowers the income
elasticity   to 2.15, though the coefficient of   the capital stock is insignificant.
Over the longer period 1969:1 to 1984:lV (used by Helkie and Hooper) this variable

is   more precisely estimated, though the income elasticity is nearly identical to

that in Table 3.

        As an alternative to the capital stock variabLe, we will use the bias terms

SHAREJ and SHARE2.       We suppose that the correct price to include in   the import

demand   equation (17) is the exact index, which is related to the conventional index
by Corollary 1.14 Substituting this into (11), we obtain:

        lnQmt     $o â€¢ $iln() + (ij)n(SHARE1 t) hln() . et                     (16)
                                                                                        22


where SHARE2 is alternatively used. We take a weighted geometric mean over
these variables at the 3-digit SITC tevel to arrive at the aggregate value for
SHARE1 or SHARE?, where we distinguish those industries with above-average and
below-average intra-company imports (using Table 2).1 5 Thus, SHAREIA denotes
the mean or SFIARE1 over the industries with above-average imports. SHARE1B
denotes the mean over the industries with below-average imports, and similarly
for SHARE2A and SHARE2B. Using the aggregates for both groups of industries in
(18). we arrive at the estimating equation:

  InomI $o
               ln(!).oi lfl(SHARE1At).(j)lfl(SHARE1 Bt)8sIn(vL}et. (19)

where SHARE2A and SHARE2B are alternatively used.
      In Figure 1 we show the values for SHARE1A and SHARE2A. aggregated over
industries with above-average intra-cornpany imports, and in Figure 2 we show
SHARE1 B and SHARE2B, for industries with below-average internal imports.1 6 All
the SHARE variables are normalized at 1.0 in 1976. In Figure 1, the SHAREA
variables are quite erratic, showing little trend aside from a decline in the last
gears of the sample. In Figure 2 by contrast, the SHAREB variables for industries
with below-average internal imports show a marked tendency to decline. SHARE1B
reflects the import shares of countries with sampled products, and declines to
0.68, or about one percent annually. A greater decline - to 0.75 - is shown by
SHARE2B, or about 2.5 percent annually. This fall indicates that the countries
with sampled products were also moving into new product lines, so that the
expenditure share on the products supplied continuously declined more rapidly.
      The results of including the SHARE variables in the import demand equations
are reported in the third and fourth regressions of   Table   3, where the third uses
SHARE1A and SHARE1B, while the fourth uses SHARE2A and SHARE2B. In both
                                                                                             23


 cases, we see that SHAPEA enters with a positive sign and SHAREB with a
 negative sign. The sign on SHAREB is expected, since $'cO in (19) in the price
 elasticity or demand, so with 0>1 the coefficient on SHAREB is negative. We
 have not offered any prediction about the sign on SHAREA, however.

         One   rationalization for the positive coefficient on SHAREA is that when       a

company decides to shift production offshore, rather than produce domestically,
we will observe both an increase in quantity and share of imports from that
foreign county source. Conversely, when a foreign company decides to expand its
U.S. manufacturing base, rather than import, there wilt be a decline in both the
quantity and share of expenditure from that source country.         It is entirety
possible that the products internally imported by these companies are included in
the BLS interviews, so that the positive correlation between SHAREA and imports
is to be expected.17

         This argument concerning the sign of SHAREA highlights the fact that all
the    SHARE variables are likely to be correlated with the error in (19), since     any
random     change in the   import quantity   from the sampled countries wilt also affect
their   expenditure shares. To address this, the third and fourth regressions in
Table 3 use instrumental variables when including the SHARE variables: the

instruments are time, time2, tim&, and the other variables on the right of (19).

Since    the SHARE variables are measured as annual values, quarterly dummies are
also    included in the instruments and the regression.

         In the third regression in Table 3,   using SHAREIA and SHARE1 B. the income
elasticity falls from 2.5 to 1.9, and the coefficients of both SHARE variables are

significant at the 10% level. The autocorrelation coefficient is also reduced. A

slightly larger impact on the income elasticity is obtained when using SI4ARE2A

and SHARE2B. calculated according to (15).        In the fourth regression, the income

elasticity falls to 1.7, though the standard errors of the SHARE coefficients are
                                                                                       24


higher than before. The reduction in the income elasticity in either case is the
principal result of our paper:   the SHARE variables has a substantial effect on the
income elasticity of aggregate import demand, moving it about halfway towards
unity. This result supports the hypothesis that the high income elasticity or
import demand is due, at least in part, to the inability of conventional indexes to
account for the expansion of product varieties from new foreign suppliers.
      Using the coefficient or SHARE2B in the fourth regression, along with the
long-run price elasticity $. we can obtain an estimate of       from (19) as
a: 1 .(l .1 49/O.926)r2.24 (with a standard error or   .08). This estimate seems
Low for an elasticity of substitution between a product differentiated across
suppliers, and is smaller than the disaggregate estimates in Feenstra (1994). One
reason for this might be that the SHARE variables are proxies for the true
expenditure shares from interviewed firms, which could bias the elasticity
estimate, For example, if SHARE2B measures only a fraction of the true expansion
in product varieties, then this variable would fall too slowly, and the resulting
elasticity estimate of $I(c-1) in (19) is upward biased â€” so a is downward
biased. More generally, from our results in section 3.1, we need not assume that
the true aggregator is CES, so that the coefficient of SHARE2B is open to
interpretation.
      Regardless of how we interpret the coefficients of the SHARE variables, we
can combine these two term with the relative import price and rewrite (18') as:

 lnomt :
           . $i[ln().(1)1n(sHARE2At) .(â€”2-â€”)ln(SIIARE2Bt)]. Bsln(-). Ct.

The term in brackets is our estimate of the (relative) exact import price index.
Then using the estimates from the fourth regression in Table 3, we construct.

      ln(PRICEBt) : ln(Pmt/Pdt) + (2-!)ln(sHARE23t)
                                                                                      25


and!
                                        .926                   .478
        ln(PRICEABt) z tn(Pmt/Pdt) + (?149)ln(SHARE2Bt)_ (i4g)lnsHARE2At


The first or these series only takes account or the industries with below-average
intra-company imports, white the second series takes into account atl industries.
Also, tet PRICEtr(Pmt/Pdt) denote the (relative) BLS import price index.
        In Figure 3, we ptot PRICE. PRICEB and PRICEAB (with 1978.1:100). The
fall in PRICE over 1960-85 ref tects the appreciation of the dollar. Both of the
other series tie below PRICE. indicating the upward bias of the conventionat index,
with PRICEAB tying below PRICES in atl years except 1987-88. The difference
between PRICE and PRICES in 1988 is 16.4, relative to their initial values of 100,
while the dirference between PRICE and PRICEAB in 1988 is 12.9. Since these
differences develop over the decade 1978-88, we conctude that the conventional
price index is upward biased by about one and one-half percentage points annually,
as compared to an exact index.


5. Conclusions
        As a necessary result of the sampling procedure used by BLS to construct
(domestic or international) price indexes, some products will be excluded from
these indexes. In this paper, we have discussed the consequences of this exclusion.
Our basic result is the expenditure shares on the sampled products provided very

useful inrormation on the movement in prices of the non-sampled goods. in

particular,   a fatling expenditure share of   the sampled products means that we

infer   a falling relative price for the nonâ€”sampled products. This inference is
particularty usetut when we consider that some of the non-sampled products may
be new, with prices are falling from their reservation to observed levels when
they are first avaitabte, Since these reservation prices are never observed (and
                                                                                         26


difficult to estimate when dealing with many goods simultaneously), the strategy
of using the expenditure shares to infer the movements in prices seems quite
attractive.
        In   Figure 3, we have plotted the (relative) U.S. import price index along
with two constructed indexes, to illustrate the upward bias in the former. It
should be stressed that this diagram is not meant to demonstrate any limitation
of the BLS procedures in collecting the import price data. Even with the best
practice techniques, we would expect any price index constructed from interview
data to be potentially biased from the exclusion of products. It would be futile
(and prohibitively expensive) to attempt      to collect such a broad range of prices
that   this potential bias is eliminated, since the (reservation) prices for new

product varieties are simply not      available.
        Rather than expanding the scope of the price interviews, the recommendation

of   this paper is to collect   expenditure data from firms at the same time as the
price data. Currently,     the expenditure   on sampled products is not collected on a
continual basis. While expenditure information is used to form an initial sample.

once a product has been selected For a price interview, the firm is no longer asked
to report the sates (for domestic price indexes) or purchases (for import price
indexes) of that product. The collection of this information would impose some
extra time-costs on the reporting firms, but it would not require any new
procedures for selecting the products to interview. That is. once a narrowlyâ€”
defined product has been identified to obtain price data, the firm could be asked
to supply (quarterly or annual) value data on exactly that same product. These
data could be reported at the same level of aggregation as the price indexes, so
that the confidentiality of firms is maintained. We have argued that this
expenditure data would be very useful to deal with the potential bias in import
prices, and it would undoubtedly be useful for domestic indexes, as well.

    If there are multiple non-sampled goods, then we assume that this set of
varieties (n is weakly separable from the set icl/jn}, and use the scalar n to
denote the aggregate of the non-sampled goods.      If these varieties {n) originally
entered the translog function (6). then the aggregator over them must be Cobb-
Douglas, for the reasons discussed in note 4. Alternatively, we could use any
aggregator over the non-sampled varieties jn}, and then just assume that this
aggregate enters the translog function (6).
6   In both 1982 and 1967, imports from majority-owned U.S. affiliates abroad
accounted for over 80% of the total intra-company imports of u.s. multinationals.
7 Zeile (1993) provides a general description of the merchandise trade of U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies, including both manufacturing and wholesale trade.
6 These data are obtained directly from Brianard (1993). whom the authors thank

internal imports of U.S. multinationals, but this was not as readily available.

above-average internal imports and it was included in the former group.
10 The BLS will sample multiple products within each 10-digit Harmonized
System category (which has replaced the TSUSA classification since 1989). so in
principle,   Sit denotes   the share within this category.
       The TSUSA numbers change very frequently, and for this reason, we ignore the
numbers and use only the TSLJSA names.
12     In an extreme case, there could be no TSLJSA category within a 3-digit SITC
that an interviewed country supplied in continuously. When this happened (which
was infrequent) we replaced the value of (s't/sti) for country k with (skt/skt.1)
before computing (15).
13     If a (linear) time trend is introduced in this equation, its coefficient is

0.002,    which is highly insignificant and reduces the income elasticity to 2.25.     In

contrast, for disaggregate import demand equations, Alterman (1993) argues that
the    inclusion of   a time trend can significantly reduce the income elasticities.
14
          can be questioned whether using the exact price index in (17) also means
that   the exact quantity index should be used on the left. We will follow usual

practtce   by using the real imports obtained by deflating nominal imports by the
BLS index, rather than deflating by an exact price index. Note that the issue of
how to construct the quantity variable goes away if the share of imports in total
expenditure ts used on the left, as in Feenstra (1994). for example.
       The weights in this geometric mean are the average export values in each 3-
digit SITC industry over the 1970-63 period, or over the 1983-68 period.

Notes:

Standard errors are in parentheses.

Dependent variable is the log of the import quantity.

Sample range is 1978:1 to 1988:IV. The coefficients of the relative import price follow a second-
order polynomial with eight quarterly lags; real GNP includes one quarterly lag; and the relative
foreign capital stock is entered as a lagged value.

The third regression uses SHARE IA and SHARE1B, while the fourth regression uses SHARE2A
and SHARE2B; in both cases the instruments for this variable are 1, t2, 0, and the other variables
in the regression. Since the share variables are measured annually, quarterly dummies are included
as instruments, and are also included in the third and fourth regressions above (but not reported).
