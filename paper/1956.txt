The Intrafamily Allocation of Goods - How to Separate the Men from the Boys?




                                  ABSTRACT


        The paper integrates the basic
                                         principles of consumption theory and the
   economics of human resources to generate a powerful method for estimating the

   distribution of consumption between parents ap.d   children.   Invoking the
   assumption of separability between parents' and children's
                                                                  consumption and the

  corresponding assumption of two—stage budgeting, It is shown that one can

  estimate the parents' share in total
                                         consumption by analyzing the effect of
  demographic changes on the consumption of adult goods (i.e.,, goods consumed

  exclusively by parents).

       Using the U.S. 1972/73 Consumption Expenditure Survey it is found that

  white married families tend to allocate about three—quarters of their

  consumption to parents and one quarter to children. The children's share of

  consumption in black families does not fall short of those in white families,

  and the share in white families where the father is absent is even higher. The

  share increases with the number of children, uut the absolute level of

 consumption per child declines. These findings are quite robust to changes in

 functional form and data—base.

 I. Introduction


The intrafamily allocation of resources has long intrigued economists of diverse

 interests: human—resources economists interested in investment in children,

economic demographers interested in the cost of children, theorists interested

in intergenerational transfers, econometricians measuring the effect of

demographic variables on consumption, and those (macro, development, public

finance and consumption economists) interested in-adult equivalence scales.

Common to them all is the recognition of the important ramifications of the

distribution of resources between parents and children, husband and wife, to

fertility patterns, marital stability, capital accumulation, growth rates,

income distribution and even to the efficacy of macro—economic policy.

     If so little is still known about this aspect of household behavior it is

not for lack of trying. Direct and indirect estimates of intrafamily allocation

date back to Engel's estimates of adult equivalence scales (1895). The major

obstacle to empirical research in this field is the lack of direct evidence.

Very few expenditure items are assigned to specific household members, and

consumption is generally reported on a household level with no way of assigning

portions of it to individual household members without additional assumptions.

Disagreement on the nature of these assumptions has prevented empiricists from

reaching a consensus.

    Past studies adopted one of two approaches: economic demographers trying

to measure the cost of children were guided by the theory of fertility, while

those interested in adult equivalence scales used the theory of consumption as
                                       —2--




their   point of departure. Cross—fertilization is still quite rare. This paper

enlists the principles of both consumption theory and the economics of human

resources to establish a common ground for the imputation of the intrafamily

allocation of resources.

     The present analysis reveals that in the absence of direct infomation the

imputation of the distribution of goods between parents and children requires

the assumption that parents' preferences for their own consumption are

unaffected by the existence of children and by the composition of children's

consumption. The assumption of separability between parents' and children's

consumption (and the corresponding assumption of two—stage budgeting) serves as

a base for estimation, where the observed effect of demographic variables on

goods consumed exclusively by parents (adult goods) is used as an indicator of

their effect on parent's overall consumption.

     A preliminary discussion of the nature of the problems faced by the

empirical researcher lays the groundwork for the formal model. Separability

between parents' and children's consumption and the distinction between

preferences and home technology are the cornerstones for the estimation

procedure. Preliminary estimates based on the U.S. 1972 Consumption Expenditure

Survey and allowing for a linear distribution rule indicate that white married

families tend to allocate about three—quarters of their consumption to parents

and one—quarter to children. Further investigation reveals that the finding is

quite robust to changes in population, in functional form, and in data—base.




II. Preliminary Discussion — Master and Slaves


The imputation of the intrafamily allocation of resources implicit in the
                                           —3—




 estimation of both adult equivalence scales and the cost of children is beset

 with controversy.1     The controversy focuses on two central questions: how to

 estimate the distribution within the household and what is actually estimated.

      An increase in family size is associated with an increase in household

 consumption. The incremental consumption, however, understates the resources

 diverted to children as it does not account for cuts in parents' own

 consumption. One source of controversy is what feature of consumption (e.g.,

 the consumption of which good) can serve as an indicator of these cuts. A

 second cause of confusion is the tendency to overemphasize consumption

 technology.

      Economists are reluctant to distinguish between             and            One

of the few exceptions is the case of adult equivalence scales, which are often

defined as "needs—corrected" deflators of income. These scales purport to

reflect changes in the family's needs as it expands or as its memeber grow

older, as well as returns to scale in consumption. In a different context (the

economics of fertility) a distinction is made between the number of children and

their "quality". The decision whether to have more children or invest more in

every child depends on the fixed costs of children and on the cost of increasing

the child's "quality" (Becker and Lewis, 1973). Given that parents' decisions

are affected by home production technology (i.e. children's needs, fixed costs,

and economies of scales) as well as by preferences, the question arises whether

one can identify and estimate the parameters of home technology.

     To clear up the confusion it   is   convenient to move away from the family

context. Borrowing a page from cleometrics, let us assume two kinds of farms:

an owner—run farm and a farm using slave—labor. Comparing the consumption levels

of these two kinds of farms, and noting that consumption levels are about the

same, it   would be hard to conclude that slaves'          are   substantially lower
                                      —4—




than those of the master, or that the consumption function demonstrates sharply

increasing returns to scale. Rather, most observers will interpret the findings

in terms of the "master" caring for his slave. To study the slaves' "needs" and

returns to scale we require separate ledgers for the farmhouse and the mansion.

Given separate information on the slaves' consumption we may be able to deduce

the returns to scale from information on changes in consumption levels as the

number of slaves changes. To study differences in                  we have to

compare the consumption levels of slaves of different ages and sexes. There is

no way these findings can be used to compare "slave needs" with those of

"masters." In either case the researchers will be careful to isolate from

the slave's expenses those components which are fixed (e.g., the price paid for

the slave).

     Measuring home production technology becomes more complicated when the

plantation does not maintain separate accounts for "slaves" and "masters." A

prerequisite for estimation is the assumption that the master's "tastes" are not

changed by the existence and number of slaves. He may change his consumption

patterns because changes in the number of slaves are associated with a change in

income or relative prices (e.g., the price of home services), but this does not

affect his consumption function. Put differently, one has to assume that the

utility the master derives from his own consumption and from that of his slaves

are separable. The assumption of "separability" is crucial for any imputation

of the distribution of resources on the farm.

    To isolate the consumption of farm owners from the consumption of the rest

of the work force, there must be some goods which are consumed exclusively by

the owner. The comparison of consumption patterns of these goods in farms of

different sizes is indicative of the change in prices and budgets facing the

mansion's housekeeper. This comparison should (under certain conditions) allow
                                       —5—




 us to decipher the allocation problem: how much of the total farm budget is

 consumed by the owners and how much by the slaves.

      Returning to the estimation of intrafamily allocation, the most disturbing

 part of the analogy is the assumption of separability. Most household

 consumption decisions rest with the parents. Their decision how to allocate the

 budget between their own consumption and that of their children depends on how

the two kinds of consumption enhance the parents' welfare. Whereas it is easy

for the researcher to accept the assumption of separability when it comes to

masters and slaves, it is somewhat less acceptable in the case of parents and

children. Quoting Samuelson (1956, p. 9), "Where the family is concerned the

phenomenon of altruism inevitalbe raises its head: if we can speak at all of the

indifference curves of any one member, we must admit that his tastes and

marginal rates of substitution are contaminated by the goods that other members

consume. These Veblen—Duesenberry external consumption effects are the essence
of family life".

     The natural excuse for adopting the assumption of separability in the

family context is provided by Samuelson himself —   it   is a prerequisite for

defining a family demand structure endowed with all "the nice properties of

modern consumption theory." This becomes especially important when one compares

the consumption pattern of childless families with those of families with

children, where it is assumed that both have the same "tastes".

     Nonetheless, it is worth investigating the assumption of separability to

learn how unacceptable it really is. Separability does not rule out altruism.

It does not even rule out parents' care for what their children consume. What

it does rule out is parents' preferences for their own consumption being

affected by their children's consumption composition. Thus, it rules out the

case where parents enjoyment from TV, music or travel is affected by the
                                      —6—




attendance of their children. It also rules out the case that parents change

their consumption habits to set a personal example for their children.

     The link between the composition of parents' and children's consumption may

not be a direct one. Family goods (i.e., family "public good") may serve as a

link between parents' and children's private goods. Thus even if the utilities

parents derive from their own and from their children's consumption are

separable, parents' and children's consumption of private goods are not, if they

are affected by the composition of family goods.

     An alternative indirect link is indivisibilities and returns to scale in

home production. Parents may adapt their consumption habits to those of their

children not because of interacting preferences but because of "economies of

scale due to sharing" in home production. Thus, a family that is observed

ordering five different menues at a restaurant will share the same meal at home.

Mothers and their teenage daughters are often observed to share the same

wardrobe.

     Children may affect the shadow prices facing their parents in other ways.

They are known to raise their mothers' shadow price of time, and thus raise the

price of time—intensive activities. Somethimes they even increase the pecuniary

costs of some activities (e.g., the cost of out—of—home entertainment is

increased when one has to pay for babysitting).2

    Granting the existence of interaction between parents' and children's

consumption it is not clear how important this interaction is empirically (one

test of the assumption of separability is provided in section VI).   It seems,

however, that ignoring this interaction and its sources is standard procedure in

consumption and demand analysis. The assumption of separability of private and

public goods is implicit in most studies of the demand for private goods.
                                           —7—




 Indivisibilities   and excess capacity in housing or home appliances have not

 impared the study of demand for these durable goods. Increasing returns to

scale can often be construed as declining incremental fixed costs of children

and incorporated in the analysis. The shadow price of time and its effect on

the allocation of goods is usually ignored in consumption studies. By assuming

separability this study does not set a precedent and is in line with standard

procedure.

     Bearing these resevations in mind, we stick with the analogy of the farm

and the family. The separation of parents' consumption from that of their

children is a necessary condition for the study of consumption technology

(returns to scale and children's "needs"), and there is no way of comparing

children's needs with those of parents (i.e., adults) unless we assume that

parents love their children as much as they love themselves (i.e., that

children's consumption yields the same utility as their own consumption).

Finally, the key to the distribution problem lies in the comparison of

consumption patterns of "adult goods" between families with and without

children.




III. The Model — Separating the Men from the Boys


The framework of the analysis is a one—period model. The parents' utility

function has two components —   the   utility derived from their own consumption

(UA) and the utility derived from their children's consumption (Us). The

utility function is (weakly) separable in the two components


     (1)      U = U(UA, UB)
                                                      —8--




In turn,          depends on the quantity of goods consumed by parents, qA,

                          A         A A          A
        (2)           U            U (q1, ...,   q)
       A
where q denotes adult goods — goods consumed exclusively by parents.3 The

utility generated by the children's consumption depends on the specific basket
              B
consumed (q1) and on what parents regard as children needs (p1)


                              =
        (3)
                                   UB[(q/p1),.   -




where    K denotes the number of children. The coefficients               p1 < 1   if parents

regard children's needs to be lower than their own (e.g., if children's

nutritional requirements are lower than those of adults, the same amount of food

will produce higher nutritional values for children than for adults).

     The utility function (1) is maximized subject to the budget constraint


                      n
                                      = X —
     (4)
                  i=1
                               P1l            C(K)


                  A            B
where q. = q. +               q1,    X denotes income, and children involve fixed costs of C

These costs may be associated with the birth of the child, or, more often, with

some minimum subsistence expenditures which assure the children's survival.5

The difference between "needs" (p1) and minimum requirements, often blurred in

the existing literature, is an important feature of the model. The budget

constraint implicitly assumes a fixed supply of labor and constant returns to

scale in consumption.6

    The conditions for an optimum look familiar

                           A
     (5)                  u1 =


                           B
                             =
                          Ui        Xpipi
                                       —9—




           =
 where u       aU/aq1 and . denotes   the marginal utility of income. The

 optimum conditions underline two important points:

 a. In this formulation, differences in children's "needs" (p1) play a role

 similar to variability in prices.

 b. The optimum allocation is affected by children's "needs," but no less impor-.

 tant is the weight placed by parents on their own consumption relative to that

 of their children (uA and uB, respectively).

     Whereas the first point may remind one of Gorman's and Barten's analysis,

 suggesting that one can derive the values of
                                                p1   and   compare them with adult

"needs,"7 the second point comes to forewarn that there is no way to infer

relative "needs" by comparing parents' and children's consumption (i.e.,

comparing across equations) unless one is ready to assume that the weights given

to them in the parents' welfare function are the same (u =      uB).
     To derive the comparative statics properties of the model one has to invoke

the separability assumption and the corresponding assumption of two—stage

budgeting (Deaton & Muellbauer, 1980, Ch. 5).° By that assumption the

allocation decision is made in two stages: in the first stage the parents decide

how to allocate total consumption between their own (X') and their children's

      where


     (6)          +      = x - C(K)


In the second stage they decide how to allocate each budget X between

different goods, where

                  ni
     (7)          pq1 =         i1
The Study of intrafamily allocation focuses primarily on the first stage, trying

to estimate the distribution rule
                                                     —10—




                     =
         (8)             h(X,p,p,C;K)

         Parents' consumption                 is expected to increase with total family

consumption, and, consequently, to decline when the cost of children increases.

The effect of a change in one of the prices                      p1 depends on the share of the good

in parents' and children's consumption, and on the price elasticity of xA. For

example, an increase in food prices may increase the relative price of

children's consumption if food constitutes a greater share in the consumption of

children than in that of parents'. This price increase raises children's

consumption if it is price inelastic. An increase in children's needs

(p1) plays a role similar to a price increase, and will result in an increase of

children's consumption at the expense of parents' only if the price elasticity

of         is less than unity. Returns to scale in consumption involve an income

effect, but may also involve a price effect if the scale economies have a

different effect on different consumption acitivities and if the compositions of

XA   and X B differ.



IV. Estimation


The family's demand for any specific good depends on the separate demand

of parents and children for that good, and on the distribution of resources

within the family. Two—stage budgeting implies

                  A    A A                and
                                                   B    B B
                                                  q. = g1(X ,pp).
     (9)         q1 = g1(X ,p)


Hence,


                         A       B        A                  B
     (10)           =
                         q1
                              + q1   =
                                         g1fh(   ), pJ   +   g.[x   —   h(   ),   ppl,
                                               —11--




 where h( ) is the distribution rule. In general, therefore, there is no way of

 separating the specific elements of demand g3( )                from the distribution rule.

 Separability allows the estimation of the parents' demand g( ) from a sample

 of childless families (i.e., where                =   X).   The identification of h( ) from
                              B
 equation (10) requires that g.( ) =          0.       In this case, the case of the adult

 goods, the demand of families with children can be rewritten


      (11)     q =   g[h(   ), 1


 and one can identify h( ) as long as g is a rnonotonic function of XA.9

      For example, let g and h be linear

      (12)


and


                             + 2(X — C) +
      (13)     XA 0 +                                  3p
where S is a set of environmental variables (e.g., age, race, schooling), and

where prices (p) are omitted in cross section estimates.1° The demand for adult

goods by families with children therefore equals


      (14)    q —    [c +          —
                                       B2J     + (cx1 + c21)S +            + cc2B3p


      The parameters a. can be estimated from a sample of families without

children. Comparing these estimates with the estimates derived from a sample

of families with children [i.e., comparing equations (12) and (14)], one can

generate the estimates of          —   the   parameters of the distribution rule

[equation <13)). Specifically, comparing the marginal propensities to consume

adult goods (a2 and a22) generates the estimate of the marginal propensity
                                        —12—




of adult consumption 2• Given           and a2 one can estimate the effect of

the environmental variables () on      xA. There is, however, no way of

separating the fixed costs (C) from the fixed component in the distribution

equation ().      To estimate the fixed costs one has to make additional assump-

tions about the fixed component (e.g., that      =   0, or that it does not change
with the number of children).

    Children's needs (p) are supposed to change with their age. The change in

needs affects parents' consumption if its price elasticity differs from unity.

Unfortunately, one cannot tell from observing the effect of children's age on

the demand for adult goods by how much children's needs change with their age,

without independent information on the price elasticity of        (i.e., one

cannot separate       from p).
                                                                        A
     Similar methods can be used to identify the parameters        if g and h
                                             A
are of a higher polynomial order, as long as g is confined to the range where

        > 0. It is worth noting, however, that if the distribution rule h is

linear, the demand for adult goods in families with and without children will be

of the same polynomial order.




V. Preliminary Results: Three to One


Our data consist of a subsample of the U.S. 1972/73 Consumer Expenditure

Survey.'1 The household's decision process may change with the number of adults

in the household.12 To isolate this factor I focused on families with husband

and wife present. The sample consists of white families with less than four

children. Since the key identifying variable is defined as clothing of adults

age sixteen or older, I excluded from the sample families with children older
                                          —13—




than fifteen. The sample contains 7,793 observations, and the sample means are

presented in Table 1.

     The identifying variables in this scheme are the group of adult goods.

Traditionally, this group consists of three goods: adult clothing, tobacco, and

alcoholic beverages. The analysis of the demand of the last two goods has

always been regarded as problematic (because of response errors and a low MPC)

(Alkinson, Gomulka, Stern, 1984a,b). We therefore used two versions of
                                                                            q:
adult clothing, and adult goods, where the latter measurese expenditures on

all three goods combined.3        The list of environmental variables contains the

husband's education, his age (and the square of this term), his employment

status and that of his wife (or alternatively, the number of weeks they worked),

region of residence (North—Central, South, and West), and whether the family

lives in a rural area.

     Running the regression for adult clothing separately in each of the samples

defined by the number of children (Table Al in the appendix) confirms our

expectations —   there   is a substantial decline in the marginal propensity to

consume adult clothing as the number of children increases.

     Since most of the environmental variables proved to be statistically

insignificant they were omitted from the following regressions. The only

variables kept are the husband's schooling (which is shown to have a positive

effect) and the number of weeks the wife worked (employed women spend more on

clothing), Of special interest among the omitted variables is the age

composition of children (i.e., the number of children in the age group 2—15),

which proves insignificant, regardless of the number of children.

    The regressions with the reduced set of variables were reestimated in the

combined sample, with a dummy variable (K). denoting the existence of children,
                                                        —14—




to   allow for differences in slopes and intercepts between the samples. The

estimating equation is


        (15)     q =        a0 + a1S + a2X + a3K + a4KS + a5KX

where S denotes the control variables. Comparing (15) with (12)                          and   (14)

a0 = est(a0),        a1 =      est(x1),        a2 =     est(2),   a3 =    est[a2(0   —
                                                                                         2C)]
                                              —   1))     Hence
a4 =    est(cc21),   a5 =     est(a2(2


               est(2)     =     1   + (a5/a2)


(16)           est(1) =        a4/a2      ,               and


               est(2C —       ) = —a3/a2
       The regressions presented in Table 2 are most illuminating. The existence

of children reduces the marginal propensity to consume adult clothing by a

quarter. Put differently, on average, the marginal propensity of parents'

consumption is 0.76, while that of children is 0.24. The distribution of

family consumption between parents' consumption and that of children is not

affected by the husband's education, but is affected by the wife's employment

status. The more the wife works (consumption held constant) the more

pecuniary resources are diverted from parents' to children's consumption. This

may be indicative either of the increased fixed costs of children

associated with the mother's work (e.g., childcare services), or of an attempt to

compensate children for smaller time inputs of working mothers.

     Art increase in the number of children may increase both the fixed costs

associated with children and the children's share in consumption. Assuming that

the fixed component in the distribution rule ()                    is    unaffected by the number

of children, an increase in fixed costs is expected to reduce the constant term
                                           —15—




 in the consumption function for adult goods, whereas an increase in the

 children's share will reduce the marginal propensity to consume.

     The separate regressions presented in Table Al indicate that as the number

 of children increases the marginal propensity to consume declines slightly but

 the constant term increases (in algebraic value). To test the significance of

 this result I added two variables to equation (15) denoting the existence of 2 and

 3 children (K2 and K3, respectively), and their interaction with consump—

 tion.'5 The expanded regression [equation (2) in Table 3] confirms the earlier

 findings —   the   MPC of adult clothing declines with the number of children. The

 implied marginal propensities of children's consumption are 0.20, 0.22, and

0.27 for families of 1, 2, and 3 children, respectively. Additional children

are also accompanied by a decline in the constant term, but whereas the

difference in the MPC adult clothing between families with no children and

families with one child is highly significant, all the new variables are not.

    A comparison of the explanatory power (R2) of the new regression with that

of the earlier ones [equation (4) in Table 2] indicates that although each of the

new variables is not statistically significant, the four as a group are. These

seemingly contradictory results are traced to the high correlation between
                                                                               K1
and the interaction term K1X (the correlation coefficient for both K1 is

0.9). Reestimating the equation with K1, leaving out the interaction terms

[equation (3) in Table 3], and estimating it with the interaction terms but

without K1 [equation (4)], shows that there is no advantage to one form over the

other. By the first equation, the fixed cost per child (beyond the first) seems

to be constant, while the second equation indIcates that the incremental share

in consumption is fixed (about 7 percent per additional child).     Thus,

additional children do increase the resources diverted to children, but

multicollinearity prevents us from telling whether this is due to an increase in
                                      —16—




fixed costs or in the marginal propensity of children's consumption.

    The environmental variables exhibit a similar pattern. For example, the

family of a working wife sharply reduces its expenditures on adult clothing when

it has a child (working mothers do not spend more on clothing than non—working

mothers), but their expenditures are only slightly reduced when it has

additional children.

    Additional support for our conclusions is gained by estimating the

regressions for adult goods (i.e., the expenditures on tobacco, alcoholic

beverages, and adult clothing combined).16 The separate regressions (presented

in Table A2 of the appendix) again demonstrate the negative relationship between

the marginal propensity to consume adult goods and the number of children, and

the fact that the children's age composition has no effect on these expenditures.

    Since children's age and the regional variables did not seem to affect the

consumption of adult goods they were omitted from the following regressions.

Reestimating the equations in the pooled sample (with dummy variables for

children) sheds some new light on the role of the environmental variables on the

allocation of resources between parents and children (Table 4).

    Families where the mother is employed reduce expenditures on adult goods

when they have children, as do the more educated and the older. The share of

children's consumption seems to increase not only with the mother's employment

but also with the husband's age and education. The decline in the MPC is,

however, identical to that reported in Table 2 (24 percent). For every

three additional dollars parents spend on themselves, they spend one on their

children.

    VI. Robustness


 Though the similarity of the results for adult clothing and adult goods is

 encouraging, it may still seem an odd feature of the demand for clothing that

 has nothing to do with intrafamily allocation. To dispel these doubts, the

 findings are subjected to a battery of tests:

 a. The findings reported in the last section relate to white married families.

       The regression are reestimated for blacks.

b.     If married families divert 25 percent of their resources to children, the

       not—married should divert a higher share. Thus, comparing the marginal

       propensities to consume adult goods between childless families and families

       with children, the decline should be sharper in the case of the not—married.

c. Naturally there is a substantial difference in the age structure of families

       with and without children (see Table 1). To isolate the age effect

       I reestimated the results in a sample where the husband's age is under 50.

d. How crucial is the assumption of linearity for the estimates? To answer

      this question I estimated the regression using higher polynomial orders.

e. To ascertain that the findings do not merely reflect some oddity in clothing

      habits of the early 1970s, the regressions are reestimated for the 1960/61

      Consumer Expenditure Survey.

f     Separability of adult and child consumption implies that the marginal

      propensity to consume should be affected by the existence of children in the

      same way for all adult goods. The similarity of the results for adult

      clothing and adult goods is consistent with this prediction. An additional

      test is the comparison of consumption patterns of male and female clothing,

      tobacco, and alcoholic beverages.'7

      Table 5 incorporates the results of the first four tests. Comparing the

results of Table 2 with the first column in Table 5, there are hardly any
                                       —18—




differences in the consumption patterns of adult clothing between white and

black married families.. The decline in the marginal propensity to consume

associated with children is almost identical (27 percent for blacks vs. 24

percent for whites). The only observable difference is the effect of the wife's

labor force participation. Families of black working women tend to cut their

expenditures on clothing when they have children (presumably because they divert

more resources to their children), but this cut is not statistically significant.

    There is a sharp difference in the age structure of not—married white women

who have children and those families with no children in the household (the

average ages are 33 and 60, respectively). To control for the age effect the

sample of the not—married was confined to those under 50 years of age. The

results confirm the expectations that the not—married divert a larger fraction

of their resources to children. The decline in the marginal propensity to

consume exceeds 60 percent.

    If husband and wife share their consumption equally, and if there are no

returns to scale in consumption, a 75:25 distribution of resources in married

families would imply a distribution of 37.5:25 in families where the mother is

not married. In this case the decline in the marginal propensity to consume is

expected to be about 40 percent (   25/62.5).   The observed sharper decline

(though it is not clear whether it is statistically significant) implies either

that wives' share is less than one half, or that the not—married tend to cut their

own share in favor of children. Note that when an additional dummy variable

denoting the existence of two or more children is added to the regression, the

marginal propensity to consume declines by about 40 percent when the mother has

one child and by another 20 percent when she has two or more children.18

   Confining the sample of white married families to those in which the head is

less than 50 years old does not change the results considerably. The decline in
                                               —19—




 the marginal propensity to consume adult clothing associated with children is

 somewhat lower than our earlier results, but the differences do not seem to be

 statistically significant.

       The last two columns in Table 5 report the findings of a quadratic

expenditure function. Let the demand for adult goods be a quadratic function of

adult consumption


(17)               q =        + cX
                                  A +      A2
                                            )
                                        a2(X

and the distribution rule be linear


(18)                 =
                         Bo÷ 1(x - C)

then the demand of families with children equals


(19)       q   =         +       — 1C) +   2O         —




                             + [c+ 2a21(0 — 1C)]x         +
                                                              a2x2
where the effects of the environmental variables and of chidren's "needs" are

incorporated, for simplicity of presentation, in the constant terms (cz0      and

        To estimate the marginal propensity of adult consumption one has to

compare the coefficients of the quadratic term (X2) in families with and

without children.tS The results reported in Table S imply a marginal propensity

that is almost identical to the one reported earlier          ( 0.73).
    We assume throughout this empirical section that the distribution rule h

is linear in consumption (X). If h is of a higher polynomial order, the

consumption function of adult goods in families with children are of a higher

polynomial order than that of families without children. The examination of

higher polynomial regressions does not support this prediction.
                                      —20—




    The results for adult goods are almost identical to those of adult clothing

and hence are not reported here.2°

    Our 1960/61 sample contained close to 5,500 observations. The white

families included in the 1960/61 sample are somewhat older than those in the

1972/73 sample. Given the high age of husbands in families without children,

the sample was confined to families whose head was less than 65 years old.21 As

in 1972/73, the sample consists of white families, husband and wife present,

with less than four children. Since in this sample adult clothing refers to

those age 18 years or more I excluded from the sample families with children or

other relatives over 18. The sample means are reported in Table 6.22

    Repeating the earlier procedures and running the regression for adult

clothing separately in each of the samples defined by the number of children

(Table A3 in the appendix), the result almost replicates those of the earlier

experiment. Rerunning the regression in the pooled sample (Table 7) and

comparing the results with those of 1972/73 (Table 2) indicates that though

clothing consumption patterns may have changed over the decade (the effect of

the environmental variables differs, and the marginal propensity to consume is

significantly higher) one feature remains constant —   the marginal propensity to
consume adult clothing declines by 25 percent when the family has children.23

    The addition of K2 and K3 and their interactions does not help in

dispelling the ambiguity concerning the effect of the number of children on the

intrafamily allocation of resources. The results reported in Table 7 are

contradictory: whereas a second child increases the marginal propensity of

childrens consumption by 14 percent (from 16 to 30 percent), three children

(compared to one) contribute only to fixed costs but do not affect the marginal

propensity to consume. This irregularity is hard to accept and should be

attributed to the vagaries of multicollinearity (the correlation coefficients

between K.1 and their interaction terms are 0.9).
                                           —21--




   The findings relating to the black married and to white not—married families

(Table 7), and the regression for adult goods (Tables 8 and A4 in the appendix)

all contribute to consolidate the earlier evidence: the reduction in the MPG of

blacks associated with children is 12-20 percent2' and the not—married cut their

MPC by more than the married (by 37 percent). The results for adult goods

almost replicate those for adult clothing (though clothing constitutes less than

two thirds of adult goods).

    Finally, to test the assumption of separability I estimated in the 1972/73

sample the consumption functions of male clothing, female clothing, tobacco, and

alcoholic beverages separately. To test the hypothesis that the MPG of these

goods declines by 25 percent when the family has childen I introduced a variable

for "parents' consumption" into the regression. This variable is defined to

equal family consumption in childless families and to equal 75 percent of

consumption in families with children. If the assumption of separability holds,

the coefficients of the interaction term "consumption x        should turn

statistically insignificant. As Table 9 indicates, all four adult goods pass

this test successfully. In spite of the inherent differences in the consumption

behavior (and specifically in the MPC) between these goods, in none of the cases

can we reject the assumption that parents relate, in their decisions concerning

their own consumption, to a budget that is 75 percent of the total consumption

budget.




VII. Selectivity Bias


The discussion in the preceding sections follows traditional demand analysis in

assuming that children are exogenously given. This assumption naturally raises

cries of "selectivity bias" —   families   with children may differ inherently from
                                         —22—




familes without children, thus giving rise to a self—selection bias.

    How dangerous is such a bias? To answer this question one has to answer two

separate questions: (a) does havjng children" necessarily imply a greater

tendency to spend on children?, (b) if such a tendency exists, does it affect our

estimation procedure? In answering the first of these questions, the

distinction has to be made between ex-ante and ex-post. A family with children,

of course, spends ex—post less on parents than a family without children. But

the relevant question is whether ex—ante a greater tendency to have children is

associated with a distribution rule that favors children.

    A greater tendency toward having children may result either from increased

"tastes" for children or from a lower "price" of children. An increase in the

weight parents assign to the welfare they derive from children (aU/aUB) leads,

in general, to an increase in the children's budget       at the expense of

parents. But this is not necessarily true in the case of a lower "price". The

paefltg tendency to have children increases the lower their fixed costs. But

lower fixed costs of children are associated with an increase in the parents'

budget. The tendency may also increase with the "efficiency" of home production

in that sector —   i.e.,   the lower the value of p. But a lower value of p results

in an increase in the children's budget only if the elasticity of substitution

between parents' and children's utilities exceeds unity.

   Thus, ex-ante it is not clear that a greater tendency to have children

implies a greater tendency to spend on children. Furthermore, even if such an

association exists, it should not disturb the study of the intrafamily allocation

of resources. What should disturb such a study is an association between the

"taste" for children and the "taste" for adult goods —    e.g.,   if adults who dislike

children are fond of clothes. More specifically, our procedure is subject to

selectivity biases only if adults who like children have a lower MPC of adult
                                       —23—




 goods. Finally one has to recall that our procedure is based on the comparison

 of families with children and families without children at home. The latter are

 much older than the former, and most of them have grown—up offsprings who have

 already left home. Thus, the danger of a selectivity bias seems minimal.

     To test for the existence of a selectivity bias we have to examine the

 effect of the "taste" for children on the MPC of adult goods. Conducting this

 test in the sample of families without children should indicate whether the bias

 exists. Conducting it in the sample of families with children should indicate

the extent to which the "taste" for children is associated with increased

 spending on children.

     A detailed test is beyond the scope of this paper. The test suggested here

is, therefore, admittedly crude. To obtain a measure of the "taste" for

children I estimate the probability that the family has children. The greater

the deviation from this estimate (in algebraic value) the greater the "taste" for

children. Thus, if the family has a child, the lower the predicted probability,

the greater the importance of unobserved variables (i.e., "taste") in explaining

the existence of children. Similarly, if the family has no children, the greater

the predicted probability of children (the smaller the residual) the smaller the

taste for children (the greater the "distaste"). Thus, the residual from this

regression can be used to trace the existence of selectivity biases in our

estimates of the demand for adult goods.

    For obvious reasons I confined the sample to white married families where

the wife is no older than 40. To estimate the probability of having children I

used a logit function. The dependent variable is K - the existence of children

at home, and the explanatory variables consist of the wife's age (AGE), the

husband's schooling (SCL), the family's income (wife's earnings excluded — INCOME),

and the regional variables.25
                                        —24—




       The logit estimates are


(20)     ln[k/(1—k)] = —0.5844 + 0.0777 AGE — 0.1008 SCL + 0.4048 INCOME
                        (30.33) (17.14)       (12.86)     (10.64)

                     + 0.1169 RURAL — 0.0112 NC + 0.0311 WEST — 0.0108 SOUTH
                       (2.09)        (0.19)       (0.51)        (0.19)


where the values in parentheses are "t—values".

       Defining the residual e = K — K, the residual was incorporated in the

regression of adult clothing (e is used as an independent variable and

interacting with consumption). The results for the sample of families without

children are reported in Table 10, and those for families with children in

Table 11.

       The results are quite conclusive. Whereas e has no significant effect on

the demand for adult clothing when the family has no children, it has a

significant negative effect on the MPC of adult clothing when the family has

children. Thus, a greater "taste" for children (a greater value of e) is not

reflected in a smaller taste for adult clothing. It leads, however, to a

greater tendency by parents to cut their own budget in favor of their children.

In spite of its crudeness the test confirms our expectation that if a

selectivity bias exists the effect is quite small.26

 VIII. The "Cost" of Children


The "cost" of children has recently been the focus of much attention of both

 economists and demographers (Espenshade, 1984; Lazear and Michael, 1985; Turchi,

1983). In a way, as some of these researchers recognize, the "cost" of children

 in a misnomer. Parents spend more on their children (i.e., invest more in their

children) in the hope of improving the children's (and their own) present and

future welfare. The recognition that higher expenditures lead to a higher

"quality" of children is an integral part of the economics of fertility. Given

this variation in quality, it is expenditures on children, or children's

consumption, in which we are interested.

    The estimates of children's consumption can be derived directly from the

estimates of the distribution h(X, S). The parameters are reported in Table 12.

The table contains three estimates of the distribution rule of married white

families based on the 1972/73 regressions of adult clothing and adult goods, and

on the 1960/61 estimate of the adult clothing regression. All three estimates

are identical: the marginal propensity of parents' consumption is 0.75 and the

constant term     +      (estimated   at the point of means) is negligible.

Consequently, the marginal and the average propensities are very close —      the
parents' share in total consumption is 0.77—0.80.

    based on the 1972/73 findings, the marginal propensity of parents' consump-

tion in black families does not differ much from that of whites, and the MPC of

white not—married women is substantially lower. The total consumption of white

married families exceeds that of black families, which in turn exceeds that of

not—married white women. The same order is maintained when one compares the

estimates of parents' consumption at the point of means. There are, however,

only slight differences in the estimates of children's consumption in the three
                                      —26—




groups. (These differences are smaller still when one compares consumption per

child, given the difference in the average number of children of the three

groups).

     This result may come as a surprise since it is often assumed that whites

invest more in their children than blacks, and that the married invest more

than do the not—married. It should, of course, be treated with caution,

given the important role of the constant term ( +          in   the determination

of the children's average consumption, where many of the estimates used

to derive this term for blacks and the not—married are not statistically

significant.27 It may, however, also be argued that the differences in parents'

pecuniary investment in their children are indeed very small, and that the major

difference lies in the investment of non—pecuniary resources. Thus, mothers in

white families reported working an average of 15 weeks in 1972/73, whereas the

corresponding figures for blacks and the not—married are 26 and 28,respectively.

The difference in the time inputs invested in children (and the quality of these

inputs) may be a major contributor to the difference in the quality of children.

   How does the number of children affect the distribution rule? Given the high

multicollinearity between K. and the interaction term "consumption x K" I

could not separate in Section V the effect of fixed costs of children from that

of a change in the marginal propensity to consume. Table 3 therefore contains

three estimates of the consumption function of adult clothing of white families

— an unrestricted one, one that assumes that the numer of children does not

affect the MPC, and one that assumes that children do not involve fixed costs

[equations (2),(3) and (4) in Table 3]. Correspondingly, I estimated three

distribution rules (columns 1-3 in Table 13). In spite of the difference in parame-

ters, the estimates of pareflt5 and children's consumption are unanimous. The

parents' share in total consumption is, on average, 85 percent when the family
                                         —27—




has one child, drops to 76 percent when the family has two children, and to 68

percent when it has three. Additional children, however, are associated, with

increased consumption.28 Consequently, the decline in parents' share involves

only a miniscule decline in their absolute consumption.

    Children's consumption increases with their number as a result of both the

increase in their share and in total family consumption. The increase is,

however, less than proportionate, and consequently the expenditure per child

declines as the number of children increases (the expenditure per child in a

family with three children is 80 percent of those in a family with one child).

there is no way of telling whether the negative correlation between the number of

children and the expenditures per child reflects returns to scale in home pro-

duction or substitution between the number of children and their "quality."

The constant term in the distribution rule h reflects the difference between

the fixed costs of parents and children. Given the estimate of h for families

with one child, one cannot isolate the fixed costs of the first child without

knowledge of the fixed costs of parents. Assuming, however, that the latter are

unaffected by the number of children, one can derive the fixed costs

associated with additional children by comparing the constant terms in h for

families of different size. By equation (13), the constant term is an estimate of
    —              Hence, dividing the differential in the constant terms by 2
        $2C(k)1.
should yield an estimate of the incremental fixed costs.

    Table 13 contains the estimates of the differential between the fixed costs

of 2 and 3 children and those of one child. Unfortunately, the variance between

the estimates is too large to allow definite conclusions on the division of

children's consumption between fixed and variable costs.29

   The patterns revealed by the 1960/61 data are almost identical to those of

1972/73. The only noticeable difference is that total family consumption does
                                       —28—




not increase with the number of children as sharply as in the later data.

Consequently, the decline in parents' consumption and in the expenditure per

child as the number of children increases is slightly greater.




IX. Concluding Comments


This paper demonstrates again the power of combining theory and empirical

estimation. Building on the most elementary principles of the theory of

consumption and the economics of human resources it is shown that the assumption

of separability of utilities generated by parents' and children's consumption

provides the researcher with a powerful tool for empirically separating these

two components of consumption. It saves the researcher from the need for ad hoc

theorizing to justify the use of a specific procedure of estimation (for

example, it obviates the need for explaining why the share of food in total

consumption should be used as a measure of welfare).

    In principle there is nothing novel either in the argument that separability

is essential for identifying the intrafamily allocation of resources or in the

claim that the consumption patterns of adult goods are the key to identification.

In their Study of the allocation of income within the household Lazear and

Michael (1985) emphasize the importance of the separability assumption, but they

do not follow the ramifications of this assumption in their empirical work.

Rothbarth (1943) was the first to suggest that consumption patterns of adult

goods can reveal the effect of demographic variables on parents' consumption.

This suggestion was followed by Nicholson (1949) and many others. Unfortunately,

lacking sound theoretical groundwork, most of these estimates suffer from a

misspecification of the estimation function.
                                          —29—




        Most studies of the effect of demographic variables on demand assume that

 this effect is additive, ignoring its effect on the MPC (i.e., implicitly

 assuming that the redistribution of income does not affect the MPC). Imposing

 on families, both with and without children, the same marginal propensity to

 consume, traditional estimates understate the MPC of childless families and

 overstate that of families with children [Figure 1, and Table 2, equation (2)].

 Since the slope of the regression and its intercept are negatively correlated,

 this misspecificatjon leads to an upward bias in the intercept of families

without children and to a downward bias in the intercept of families with

children [compare equation (2) and (3) in Table 2 and equations (1) and (2) in

table 41. Thus, it overstates the "fixed costs" effect of children. The covariance

between slope and intercept increases with X. Since total consumption and the

number of children are positively correlated, the upward bias in the "fixed

costs" effect (i.e., the downward bias of the intercept) is more pronounced the

larger family size (in Figure 1 a0 > a > a1 > a2 > a3 ).

   The theoretical analysis also implies that given standard utility analysis,

the modified Rothbarth method is the only one that allows the separation of

factors that are goods—specific from those determining the distribution rule.

The identification of the distribution rule is a prerequisite for the estimation

of the specific demand of children and parents in families with children, rather

than vice versa (as implied by the Engel, Barten, and other methods).

    Our estimates indicate that married families with 1—3 children spend on

the margin one quarter, and on average 20—30 percent of their total consumption

on children. There is no observable difference between whites and blacks, and

the share is higher for not—married women. These estimates are extremely robust

to variations in the definition of adult goods, functional form, and sources of

data.

     Public policy aimed at encouraging population growth or increasing

horizontal equity often tries to compensate families for the cost of children

(through child allowances, tax credit, and in other ways).° For a compensation

scheme such as this, it is important to distinguish between the fixed costs of

children and other expenditures imposed on the family by the children's "needs,"

and those expenditure items that are discretionary and intended to improve the

children's quality. The theoretical analysis implies that this is often

impossible, and if possible — a very difficult task. The empirical analysis

indicates that the allocation of resources within the family is not affected by

the children's age structure. Thus, in as much as children's "needs" change

with age, these changing needs do not affect children's consumption.

    It is impossible to estimate the fixed costs associated with the first child

without knowledge of the fixed costs of adults (i.e., parents). Our attempts to

estimate the incremental fixed costs (those associated with a second or a third

child) were hampered by multicollinearity. Thus, it is impossible to tell

whether children's consumption increases with their number because of fixed

costs, or because parents prefer to spend a larger fraction of their resources

on children.

    Finally, in spite of the ever increasing number of empirical studies, most

economists still seem to be wary of imputations of the intrafamily allocation of

resources. Hopefully, the robustness of our estimates will disperse some of

these suspicions. Still, this is only a first step in an an extensive research

agenda:

    a. The treatment of self selection in this paper has necessarily been

brief. A more detailed analysis is required allowing for the endogeneity of

family size, to examine the substitution between "quantity" and "quality" of

children, a central theme in the economics of fertility.
                                     —31—




    b.   A major component of the cost of children is the value of the parents

time. Our scheme should allow the incorporation of parents' time (and more

specifically, mothers' time) in the analysis, and the joint estimation of the

intrafamily of time and goods.31

    c.   Channels of intergenerational transfers have been shown to be most

important in a wide range of contexts, from intergenerational mobility and the

distribution of income to the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy. Our model

ignored these issues, confining itself to a one—period framework. Its expansion

to the multiperiod case should enrich our knowledge of the oft—discussed but

rarely studied subject of the effect of children on consumption and saving.


    Judging the richness of this further research agenda, this paper seems to be

only a small first step.

Grilliches, Edward Lazear, Kevin Murphy, Robert Michael, Eytan Sheshinski,

Menachem Yaari, Shlomo Yitzhaki and participants in workshops at the National

Bureau of Economic Research, the University of Chicago, the University of

Wisconsin at Madison, Columbia University and the Hebrew University. This study

would not have been possible without the devoted work of my research assistant

Tamir Hay.


 1. For a most recent manifestation see Deaton and Muellbauer (1986). For an

earlier discussion of the state of the art, see Deaton and Muellbauer (1980,

Ch. 8).

 2. It is often claimed that demographic changes affect the relative prices

confronting the family. By this argument the price of goods that are more

sensitive to demographic factors (e.g., changes in family size) change

relatively to those goods which are less sensitive. I have shown elsewhere

(Gronau, 1986) that these changes in the Barten prices are endogenous, and an

outcome of family decision, rather than determining family decisions.

 3. I ignore throughout the analysis "family goods". The formulation of the

model is very similar to that of Samuelson's seminal paper (1956).

 4. A different way of formulating the difference in the utility function is in

terms of Becker's home production analysis, where U3 = U3(Z3), and the

commodities Z3 are in the case of children                =

 5.   In the framework of a linear expenditure system (i.e., when UB is a

Stone—Geary function) C stands for the cost of the minimum requirements.

These minimum requirements can be incorporated directly in the utility function

by writing   uB =   u[(q3   —
                                c.)/p.]   ,       where       p.c1 = C

 6. Alternatively, one can assume that the utility function is separable in

goods and leisure (as it is in current and future consumption). To introduce
                                         —33—




 returns to scale one has to reformulate the utility functions in terms of

 commodities Z, which in turn are a function of goods and family size. We do

 not intend to exploit this approach in this paper.

  7. A method often suggested (and much debated) in the literature is to derive

the scales from information on price elasticities.

 8. For further discussion of the implications of two-stage budgeting see

Strotz (1957, 1959) and Gorman (1959).

 9. Our purpose is not served by goods consumed exclusively by children since

we do not usually observe "parentless" families (i.e., families consisting only

of children). Even if they exist, they should be removed from the sample

because decisions in them are not made by parents.

10. Barnes and Gillingham (1984) have recently employed inter—city variation in

prices and changes in prices over the sampling period to derive the price

effects from the 1972—73 Consumer Expenditure Survey. I ignore this variation.

More importantly, I assume that the existence of children does not affect the

price of goods (e.g., the price of a visit to the theatre may include, for a

family with children, the cost of a babysitter). This assumption can be more

easily defended as long as we do not incorporate the cost of time in the

analysis.

11. These data have been used extensively for the estimation of adult

equivalence scales (Barnes and Gillingham, 1984; Espenshade, 1984; Lazear and

Michael, 1985; Turchi, 1983; Van der Gaag and Smolensky, 1982).

12. Changes in housing arrangements (and other consumption patterns) following

marriage are indicative of this change (and the underlying utility function) as

much as of changes in needs or returns to scale.

13. Running separate regressions for tobacco and alcoholic beverages yields

results which are consistent with the theory but inconclusive in a statistical

sense.
                                         —34—




14. Women did not report their education in 1972. Using the 1973 subsample

shows that replacing the husband's education with that of the wife does not

change the results.

15. Note that since K denotes the existence of children, the coefficient of

K2 measures the incremental effect of a second child and that of K3 the

incremental effect of three children compared to having only one.

16. On the average adult goods exceed adult clothing by 50 percent.

17. Deaton has called this a test for "demographic separability" (Deaton, Ruiz-

Castillo, Thomas, 1985).

18. The coefficients of "consumption," "consumption x K," and "consumption x K2+"

are 0.1664, —0.0724, and —0.0343 (with t values of 23.38, 4.45, and 1.83),

respectively, where K2+ is the dummy variable denoting the existence of two

children or more.

19. Estimating a quadratic function with a dummy variable K denoting

children, let a1 denote the coefficient x2 and        a2 that of K x x2        then

est () = [1 + (a2/a1)]''2   .   In   principle it is also possible to derive

from the coefficients of X and the constant terms, but this procedure becomes

very complicated when one allows for the existence of environmental variables.

20. The only exception is the case of the quadratic function where the

implied marginal propensity of parents' consumption is 0.6.

21. Applying the same restriction to the 1972/73 sample does not affect the

results. Another difference between the two samples is the high percentage of

rural families in the 1960/61 sample (44 vs. 19 in 1972/73). Restricting the

1960/61 sample to urban families does not affect the results.

22. In the absence of data on number of weeks worked by the wife I used a dummy

variable denoting the women's labor force participation, and instead of "number
                                       —35—




 of children 0—5," I used a variable denoting that the youngest child is 5 years

 old or younger.

 23. Removing the age restriction, the MPC declines by 17—20 percent.

Restricting the sample to those under 50, the decline in the MPC of adult

clothing is much lower, but the decline in the MPC of adult goods is 20

percent.

24. The estimate for adult clothing is not statistically significant.

25. I would prefer to use the wife's schooling but this information was

available only for part of the sample (see n. 14). I subtracted the wife's

earnings from income because they depend heavily on the wife's labor supply

which, in turn, depends on the existence of children. Income is measured in

units of $10,000. The 1972/73 sample consisted of 4,240 families of whom 75

percent had children.

26. An additional qualification should be added. The variables CONSUMPTION and

e.CONSUMPTION are highly correlated in the sample without children (r =    0.88)
and not correlated in the sample with children (r =   0.20).   The results reported

in Table 10 may therefore be affected by multicollinearity. The results,

however, are replicated in a sample where the husband's age does not exceed 50.

27. This is particularly true for the 1960/61 estimates for these two groups.

28. The direction of causality is, of course, not clear.

29. Another source of difficulty is the interpretation of the effect women's

market work has on the distribution rule. The estimates are based on the impli-

cit assumption that working mothers cut their own consumption in favor of their

children to compensate them for smaller time inputs devoted to childcare. Had I

assumed that the negative coefficient reflects increased fixed costs of

children, the estimates of the fixed costs should have beer considerably lower

(because the wife's weeks of work decline as number of her children increases).
                                      —36—




30. The welfare implications of such compensation schemes are discussed in

Gronau (1985).

31. Two studies that discuss the joint decision of consumption and labor supply

are Abbot and Ashenfelter (1976) and Atkinson and Stern (1979). The value of

mothers' time is often incorporated in estimates of the cost of children, but

is consistently ignored in estimates of adult equivalence scales.
