               Adolescent Health, Family Background,
                   and Preventive Medical Care


                              ABSTRACT



      This paper investigates the health of white adolescents,

focusing particularly on the roles of family background and nreventive

medical care. This emphasis is motivated in part by our desire to

study adolescent health in the context of the nature—nurture contro-

versy. The findings indicate first, that family characteristics

(especially mother's schooling) do have a significant impact on

adolescent health and second, that preventive care is an imnortant

vehicle for this impact in the case of dental health hut not in the

ease of nhysicai. health measures. Similarly, the greater availability

of dentists hs a positive impact on dental health, but greater

availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical health

measures. On the basis of these results we predict that Qoverment

efforts to improve the dental health of adolescents with policies to

lower the cost of dental care or increase the availability of dentists

are much more likely to be successful than similar policies directec!

at improving their physical health.

         This paper investigates the health of white adolescents, focusing
particularly on        the roles   of family background and preventive medical
care. This emphasis ii motivated in part by our desire to study adoles-
cent health in the context of the nature—nurture controversy. Despite
the   existence   of a massive literature on the relative importance of hered-
ity (nature) and the home and school environment (nurture) in the determi-
nation of cognitive development,1 the corresponding issue has not been
directly addressed by researchers in child and adolescent health. This is
partly because     much of the health research is limited either to poverty or

to minority populations (Hu 1973; Kessner         1974; Inman 1976;      Dutton   1978;
Dutton   and   Silber 1979),   and   partly because researchers who   use represen-
tative samples do not adopt the multivariate context necessary for distin-
guishing between genetic and environmental influences (Douglas 1951;
Douglas and Bloomfield 1958; Keilmer—Pringle, Butler, and Davie             1966;

Haggerty,    Roghntann, and Pleas 1975; Zimmer 1978). Our        research uses multi—

variate    statistical techniques to provide some evidence of the degree to
which nurture——that is, the family and local environment——acts in deter-
mining the health levels of a representative sample of white adolescents.
       One aspect of the adolescent's environment, medical care, has been

recognized     as the   logical vehicle for public policy     aimed at   improving

adolescent health. For example, Newberger, Newberger, and Ricbeond                (1976),
Keniston   and   the   Carngeie Council on Children (1977), and Marmor (1977) all

have proposed that national         health insurance   should provide coverage of
                                     —2—


prenatal care,    pediatric   care, and   dental   care.   Bills   with this aim   have

bean introduced in Congress by Senator Jacob K. Javits and             Congressman

James H. Scheuer, both of New York. To cite another illustration, recently—

enacted Federal legislation has attempted to increase the availability of

pediatricians and dentists in medically underserved areas to expand the

use of preventive care in such areas. The Emergency Health Personnel Act

of 1970 (PL 91—623) created the National Health Service Corps., whose mem-

bers are   assigned   to health manpower    shortage   areas. The Health Profes-

sions Assistance Act of 1976 (PL 94—484) encourages new graduates of medi-

cal and dental schools to locate in urban          ghettos   and rural regions by

forgiving their medical education loan obligations.            Further, the Health

Maintenance Organization Act of 1974 (PL 93—222) gives priority for de—

veloretental funding of lIMOs in medically deprived areas.            One objective

of our research is to provide estimates of the potential payoffs to

national health insurance and medical manpower policies directed at im-

proving youths' health.

      The specific health indicators we study are oral health, obesity,

 anemia, and corrected distance vision. These four are chosen not only

 because they represent health problems that create discomfort for the

 teenager, but more importantly, because they may be good predictors of

 subsequent adult health. Indeed, they all partly reflect poor health

 habits   that   are likely to persist    into   adulthood. With the growing evi-

 dence that adults' choice of life styles and health behaviors can have

 important impacts on their health (Breslow and Klein 1971; Fuchs             1974a,
 1974b; Grossman 1975; Manheim 1975), it is natural to look into adoles-

 cence to understand the formation of these habits. A second motivation
                                     —3-.




 for choosing these indicators is that they represent health problems that

are capable of being affected by family decisions concerning diet and       other
forms of at-home health care, as well as by pediatric and dental care.
This is in contrast to many adolescent health problems that are either
self—limiting, such as   morbidity from acute conditions,     or irreversible,

such as congenital abnormalities of the neurological system.

        To analyze these health problems we use data from Cycle III of the

U.S. Health Examination Survey (HES),     an   exceptional source of jnformation

about a national sample of 6,768 noninstitutionaljzed youths aged 12 to

17 years in the 1966—70 period.2 The data comprise complete medical his-

tories of each youth provided by the parent, information on family socio-

economic characteristics, and birth certificate information. Most impor-

tant, there are   objective   measures of health from detailed physical

examinations   given to the youths by pediatricians and dentists employed
by the Public Health Service. These data are supplemented by two medical
resource inputs specific to the youth's county of residence (the number
of pediatricians per capita and the number of dentists per capita) and
information on the presence of controlled or natural fluorides in the
water   supply system that services the youth's community. The last piece

of information enables us to evaluate the impact of a collective, as op-
posed to an individual, preventive dental practice.
        These data are used to estimate two types of relations: a health pro-
duction function and a derived demand function for preventive care. The
resulting estimates permit us to answer the following four questions.
What is the size of the home environmental effect on      adolescent oral and
physical   (obesity, anemia, corrected distance vision) health outcomes?
                               —4—

How important is the home environment as a determinant of the demand for

preventive dental and pediatric care? How large are the effects of den-

tists, preventive dental care, and fluoridation on oral health outcomes?

How large are the effects of pediatricians and preventive pediatric care

on physical health outcomes? In addressing the last two questions, we

recognize explicitly the common—sense proposition that an increase in a

community's physician or dental manpower will not increase health out-

comes unless it encourages more utilization of medical care services.

Previous empirical work on the impact of physicians or dentists on

health has not taken account of this restriction (for example, Newhouse

and Friedlander 1977).

      Our findings indicate first, that family characteristics do have a

significant impact on adolescent health and second, that preventive care

is an important vehicle for this impact in the case of dental health but

not in the case of the three physical health measures. Similarly, the

greater availability of dentists has a positive impact on dental health,

but greater availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical

health measures. On the basis of these results we predict that govern-

ment efforts to improve the dental health of adolescents with policies

to lower the cost of dental care or increase the availability of dentists

are much more likely to be successful than similar policies directed at

improving their physical health.


                           I. Analytical Framework

      In a previous paper (Edwards and Grossman 1980), we have argued that

offsprings' health can be examined fruitfully within the context of the

economic models of fertility developed by Becker and Lewis (1973), Willis
                                            —5—




(1973),     and   Ben Porath   and Welch (1976). In these models the parents'

utility function      depends   on their own   consumption,    their family size, and

the    "quality of each child. Child Nqualitysl refers to those

characteristics of the child that generate utility for the parents: his

health, sex, wealth, social adjustment, intellectual develoinent, etc.

Therefore, when parents choose their optimal family composition, they

choose not only how many children they will have but also what portion

of the family's resources will be devoted to each child. This choice is

made in the usual way:         parents choose the number and      quality   of children,

as well as of other consumption goods, so as to maximize their utility

subject to the constraints imposed by their wealth (their potential earned

and   nonearned income) and the various prices          they   face. In the case of
children,     there is a further    constraint in the form of children's genetic

endowments which in part determine their quality. Genetic endowments act

as a constraint because        they are   largely   outside of the family's control.
         The prices of children and of       the various components of their quality

are   determined by a fundamental insight embedded in the household produc-
tion function approach to consumer behavior: consumers produce
their basic objects of choice with inputs of goods and services purchased
in the market and their own time (Becker 1965). This insight is of par-
ticular relevance in dealing with children and their health because par-
ents obviously      do not buy these objects of choice directly in the market;

both   a   child's home environment and      his   genetic endowment are important

determinants of his ultimate health level. Therefore, the price of health

depends on the coat      of the parents' or other caretakers' time, and the
prices     of medical care,    nutrition,   and any other purchased inputs used to
                                    —6—




improve children's health. It also depends on the number of children in
the family because the more children there are in the family, the more

costly it is to raise   their   average health level. In addition, to the

extent that there are systematic differences in the ability of families

to produce children's health with given inputs, these differences in

efficiency are also relevant. For example, more educated parents are

more likely to be able to follow doctors' instructions, to have general

information about nutrition, and to be willing and able to acquire medi-

cal information from published materials. Consequently, one would expect

more educated parents to be more efficient in producing healthy children.

      Given these considerations, the following factors are expected to

influence children's health levels: the child's exogenous (genetic)

health endowment, family wealth, parents' wage rates, family size, par-

ents' educational attainment and other measures of their efficiency in



                                                                .
household production, and the direct and indirect costs of medical care

and other market health   inputs (vitamins, sanitation, etc.)       (The in-

direct costs of medical care are generated by the time spent in traveling,

waiting, and obtaining information about this care.4) The relationship

between the child's ultimate health and this set of factors may be

termed a demand function for the output of health. In this demand func'

tion a positive association between children's health and family wealth

is predicted (assuming that child health is a normal good). Similarly, a

positive association is expected between both parents' education and chil-

dren's endowed health status and children's ultimate health status.

Negative associations   would be anticipated between all of the prices of
 health inputs and   children's health, and between family size and chil-

 dren's health. Parents' wage rates may have negative or positive effects
                                         —7—



on children's health levels depending on whether the household produc-
tion of children's health is more or less time intensive than the pro-
duction of other aspects of child quality and/or other types of parents'
consumption   coimnodities. In this framework       a child's   health is treated

as a single datum—-his permanent health measured, say, at the beginning

of adulthood or as an average over his childhood and adolescence, This

type of model   is   not   formulated   to explain variations in health   over child-
hood or   to examine the child's contributj         to his own health.5
      The above model      provides   a useful setting within which to view

adolescent health, but      empirical estimation of the resultant "demand for
health"   function would not yield answers to the questions
posed in the introduction. Such estimates would only yield information
about the total impact of family characteristics or medical input prices
on children's health. To determine the effect of preventive care on
health we need estimates of the health production function. Similarly,
to determine whether families with specific characteristics are more
efficient at producing healthy children also requires estimates of this
production function. Alternatively, to assess the role of family char-
acteristics in determining the amount of preventive care received by
adolescents, an estimate of a derived demand function for medical care
is needed. Finally, a computation of the impact of health manpower
availability on adolescent health requires not only the above functions
but also a set of market demand and supply for health manpower functions.
In the latter case, we employ a simplified approach which yields rough
estimates of these manpower availability effects on health.
                                —8—


A. The Health Production Function

      A simple, linear health production function6 is represented by



(1)
              H=80+1E+B2G+83M+4X+85R+u1

Here H is a health measure, E is a vector of family efficiency character-

istics, G is a vector of the adolescent's endowed health characteristics,

M is a medical or dental care input, X is a vector of other family inputs

(nutrition, parents' time, etc.), R is a vector of relevant regional char-

acteristics (city size, region of the country, and whether or not the

water supply is fluoridated), and u1 is a random error term with the

usual properties.

      The health production function actually estimated in Section III

does not correspond exactly to equation (1) because of inadequate data.

First, data on the amount of "other" inputs (X) are not available.

Therefore, we include the following proxy measures for X: family income,

family size, and the mother's labor force status. Family income is posi-

tively related and family size is negatively related to nutrition and

other unmeasured market health inputs. Family size and mother's labor

force status are proxies for the amount of time the mother spends with

each of her offspring. Women who work full—time or part—time in the

labor market and women with many offspring have less time to spend with

each one. In addition, our data do not include good information about

curative care, Consequently, M represents only preventive care. This is

not a serious deficiency because we have chosen health measures for which

the impact of preventive care (with the associated remedial treatment) is
                                  — 8a —



relatively   large. (By focusing on health problems for which the medical

input is primarily preventive, we also avoid the necessity of modeling

the simultaneous determination of health levels and   curative   care utili-

zation.)
                                       —9—




B. The Derived Demand for Preventive Care
        The derived demand function for medical care depends on the same set
of variables as the demand function for health:

(2)                M—y0+y1F+y2G+y3P+y4R+u2

F represents family income, education, family size, and other family char-
acteristics affecting either the demand for health or the family's effi-
ciency in producing healthy children G and R are the same as in equation
(1);   P represents a vector of relevant direct and    indirect input prices
(wage rates, the      cost of a doctor or dental visit, etc.); and u2 is the
usual random error term.

        We   cannot estimate this derived demand curve exactly as stated be-
cause data on p are not available. Inclusion of variables representing
the mother's labor force status helps control for variations in the
mother's     wate rate. Other input prices are partially controlled for by

the region and      city—size   variables in R. Finally, physician or dentist

availability measures are       included   to represent differences in the direct

and    indirect   costs of medical or dental care.7    Thus, rather   than   equation
(2), we estimate the following:



(3)
                    M=u0+a1F+a2G+a3D+U4R+U3

where the vector F now includes the mother's labor force status and D
                                      — 10 —




represents    the number of pediatricians or dentists per capita in the ado-

lescent's county of residence.


C. The Role of Health Manpower Availability

         It is the inclusion of manpoweravailability measures in         the derived

demand   for preventive care functions that permits us to obtain         a rough

assessment   of the impact of health manpower on the demand       for   preventive
care, and consequently, on adolescent health. Only        a rough assessment is

possible   because to get precise estimates it     is necessary   to have, first,
data   on the direct and indirect costs of medical care and second, measures

of the price elasticity of supply of physicians or dentists. Good esti-

mates of the supply elasticities do not exist, and it is almost impossible

to measure all of the indirect costs of medical care. Although data on

direct costs   do exist, they are not usually     found in conjunction with the
detailed   health and family background data used here. Thus, our esti-

mate of the impact of health manpower on health is the best that can be
obtained given the limitations of existing data sets • The coefficients
of the health manpower variables in the derived demand equations embody
both the relationship between health manpower availability and direct and
indirect medical care prices, and the relationship between medical care
prices and the demand for preventive care.
        Implicit   in the above   discussion is the assumption that an increase
in   a community's health manpower will not improve the health of adoles-

cents unless it encourages a greater utilization of preventive care ser-

vices. This assumption is explicitly incorporated in equations (1) and
                                         — 11 —




(3):    D is assumed to have no direct effect on health in equation (1) but

alters health only via its impact on M in equation (3). Substituting

equation (3) into equation (1) yields estimates of the total impact of

doctor or dentist availability on health:



(4)          H= Bo+ 81E+     83a1F+ (82+          83a2) c+ 83a3D


                      84X+ (85+ 83 a4) R+u1+ 83u3


The total impact of pediatrician or dentist availability on health is given

by 83 a3. Note that an estimate of the total impact computed from individ-

ual estimates of a3 and 83 differs from that obtained from direct estimation

of equation (4) because the latter does not incorporate the restriction

that D does not appear in equation (l).8


D.     The Role of Family Background Variables
        To the extent that there are faini ].y background variables common to
both the set E and the set F (parents educational attainment is a good
example of one), the substitution in equation (4) provides an additional
insight. Parents' education is clearly seen to have two effects on ado-
lescent    health: a direct or "efficiency" effect given by 8i and an in-

direct or "allocative" effect given by 83 U1.        The latter refers to the

ability of parents with greater schooling levels to select a better input
                                     9
mix    in the production function.

                             II. Empirical Implementation
        Equations (1) and (3)    are estimated   using Cycle III data for white
adolescents who     with either both of- their parents
                   live

or with their mothers only. Black adolescents are excluded from the
empirical analysis. Preliminary results revealed significant race differ-
ences in slope coefficients so that pooling blacks and whites for estima-
tion was    inappropriate.     Separate estimates for black adolescents are

not presented because the black sample is too small to allow for reliable

coefficient estimates. Observations are also deleted if there are missing

data. The final sample size ii 4,121. Table 1 contains definitions,

means, and standard deviations of all of the dependent and independent

variables •    It also contains a notation concerning the source of each
variable.


A.   Measurement of Adolescent Health
        In the introduction to this paper, we expressed an intention to
study physiological measures of adolescent health that (1) reflect det-
rimental health behaviors or life styles that may persist and create
more serious problems in adulthood and (2) relate to problems that can
be modified by endogenous inputs in the health production function such
as proper diet, parents' time, and especially preventive medical care.1°
Based on these criteria, we focus on two correlates of poor oral health:
the periodontal index and the number of decayed permanent teeth; and on
three correlates of poor      physical   health: obesity, abnormal corrected
distance   vision, and anemia as    reflected by Low   hematocrit   levels. All
five   measures clearly relate to conditions that can carry on into adult-

hood, and all can be modified      by appropriate care. Dental care provided

was done using the entire Cycle III sample rather than the subsample

reported on in this paper. In particular, the negative mean reflects

the better oral health of white youths compared to black youths.

by dentists has a direct impact on tooth decay and          periodontal   disease.

The prescription of eyeglasses by an ophthalmologist          or-anoptometrist
can remedy abnormal       distance vision. Pediatricians also play an impor-

tant    role   in eye care because they often are responsible for examining

a youth's eyes initially and         referring   his parents to an eye specialist

if necessary. Finally, all of the health measures excluding vision re-

flect basic nutritional factors that         can be   modified by the appropriate

diet.    These measures are described in detail below.
         The periodontal index (APERI) is a good overall indicator of oral
health as well as a positive correlate of nutrition (Russell 1956).
Kelly    and   Sanchez (1972, pp. 1—2)    describe the periodontal index as fol-

lows:


         Every tooth in the mouth ...      is
                                          scored according to the
         presence or absence of manifest signs of periodontal
         disease. When a portion of the free gingiva is inflamed,
         a score of 1 is recorded. When completely circumscribed
         by inflammation, teeth are scored 2. Teeth with frank
         periodontal pockets are scored 6 when their masticatory
         function is unimpaired and 8 when it is impaired. The
         arithmetic average of all scores is the individual's
          [periodontal index), which ranges from a low of 0.0
          (no inflammation or periodontal pockets) to a high of
         8.0 (all teeth with pockets and impaired function).


It is clear from this description that higher values of the periodontal

index correspond to poorer          dental health. Our measure, APERI, is scaled
somewhat differently from that described above in order to remove the
well-known age and sex trends in the periodontal index. APERI is com-
puted as the difference between the adolescent's actual periodontal index
and the mean      index   for his or her age-sex group divided by the standard
deviation for that        age—sex   group.11 A similar method of age and sex
                                         — 19 —




standardization       is used for our other measure of oral health, the number

of decayed permanent teeth (IDECAY). We employ two measures of dental

health because it is one of the few health problems for which well-

defined continuous health measures have been developed.

       Obesity is represented by a dichotomous variable that equals one

if the physician rates the youth as obese or very obese (OBESE). The

physician presumably takes account of the youth's height, age, and sex

in making his evaluation.

       Anemia is represented      by   a dichotomous variable that equals one       if
the   youth's   heinatocrit level is "excessively" low (ANEMIA).12 The

hematocrit level of a female youth is considered to be excessively low

if it is more than two standard deviations below         the   mean for all females

12 to 17 years of age. The hematocrit level of a male youth            is   con-

sidered to be excessively low       if   it is more than two standard deviations

below the mean for all males in his stage of sexual maturity. This pro-

cedure is based       on Daniel's (1973) findings that (1)     heznatocrit values

differ by sex; (2) these values depend on sexual maturity rather than

age for male adolescents; and (3) hematocrit levels are independent of

age and sexual maturity for female adolescents. 13
       Abnormal corrected distance vision is denoted by a dichotomous vari-
able that equals one if a       youth wears   glasses and   his corrected binocular

distance vision is 20/40 or worse or if a youth does not wear glasses and

his uncorrected binocular distance vision is 20/40 or worse (PVIS). This

standard   of   abnormal   distance vision is the one   used   by National Center
for Health Statistics (1972).
       It is    instructive to consider measures of adolescent health that are
excluded by     our   selection criteria. Abnormal hearing is subject to
                                     — 20   —




medical    intervention, but the prevalence rate of this condition is less
than 1 percent in the NESS      Hence, it   is far too rare to pose      a threat

to   the future lifetime well—being of a significant percentage of adoles-
cents. High blood pressure is not        studied   because there is a lack of
consensus among pediatricians concerning the importance of this condi-
tion in adolescence and the appropriate treatment (National Heart, Lung,
and Blood    Institute's   Task Force 1977). Moreover, the measures of high
blood pressure in Cycle III are somewhat suspect (National Center for
Health Statistics 1977). Congenital abnormalities are a source of
current and future difficulties, but we do not study         them   because to a
large extent they are irreversible. Parental ratings of adolescent
health and other subjective indicators are avoided because of the pos-
sibility that responses depend on the parents' socioeconomic status.
Parents with low   levels   of income   and schooling   are likely to be dis-
satisfied with   many aspects of their life including the health of their

offspring. Finally, we do not include measures relating to the "new

morbidity" such as "learning difficulties and school problems, behavioral

disturbances, ... and the problems of adolescents in coping and adjust-

ing ..."    (see Haggarty, Roqhinann and Pless (1975), p. 316). While such

measures may well reflect life styles that have serious health conse-

quences, they are unlikely to be revealed in a physical exam. Nor are

they likely to be easily altered by preventive medical care. Although

examination of these and other excluded health measures would be neces-

sary to   paint a complete picture of the health of this adolescent cohort,

it is not relevant to the objectives of this paper.

B.   Measurement of Preventive Dental and Medical Care

      Preventive dental care is measured by a dichotomous variable that

equals one if the youth saw a dentist for a check—up within the past

year (DTPREV). Similarly, preventive pediatric care is measured by a

dichotomous variable that equals one if the youth saw a doctor for a

check—up within the past year (DRPREV). These variables distinguish

between two groups of adolescents:      (1) those who received preventive

care; and (2) those who received no care at all or only curative care.

These two measures of preventive care are preferred to alternatives like

the number of dental or physician visits or the receipt of curative care

alone because our measures are less likely to reflect reverse causality

from poor health to more medical care. Of course, our measures

reflect the possibility that adolescents received treatment as well, as

an examination, but the appropriate treatment of problems revealed by

an annual check—up is an integral component of preventive care.

      Fluoridation is indicated by a dichotomous variable that is equal

to one if the community in which the youth resides uses naturally fluo-

ridated or controlled fluoridated water (FLUOR). Naturally fluroridated

communities are serviced by a water supply system that contains a natu-

ral fluoride content of 0.7 parts per million or higher. They are iden-

tified by the Division of Dental Health of the National Institutes of

Health (1969). Controlled fluoridated communities are those that have

adjusted the fluoride content of their water supply systems to the

optimum level. They are identified by the Division of Dental Health of

the National Institutes of Health (1970). For youths who reside in con-

trolled   communities, the   fluoridation variable equals one only if the
                                               — 22 —




     date on which that youth was examined in the RES
                                                      succeeds the date on
 which the community        adjusted   the fluoride content of its water supply

     system. This insures that youths in controlled communities
                                                                          actually
 were exposed to fluoridated water.


 C. The Pediatrician and         Dentist     Availability Measures
          The   youths in   Cycle III were selected from 38 distinct

 primary    sampling units • The primary sampling unit is a county          or a
 group of several contiguous counties, some of which form a standard
 metropolitan statistical area. We obtained data on the number of den-
 tists    per capita (DENT) in each youth's primary sampling unit
                                                                            (hereafter
 termed his county or community         of    residence) for the year 1968 (the mid-

year of the Cycle 111 survey) from publications of the American Dental

Association. The number of pediatricians is not available for the years

during which the HES was
                                conducted (1966—70). Therefore, we use the          num-
ber of pediatricians per capita in the county of residence (PED) for the

year    1964 from the   American Medical Association (Theodore and         Sutter
l965)) We believe that the number of pediatricians in
                                                      1964 is a
good proxy for the number        in 1968. Although youths receive medical care
from other types of physicians__genera'
                                        practitioners, internists, and
ophtha1jjsts__these physicians also service adults while pediatricians
do not. Therefore, we focus on pediatricia               as   the most important   sup-
pliers of physicians' services to            youths.16


D.     Measurement of Other Explanatory Variables
        Many of the remaining explanatory variables called for in Section ii
require no further elaboration. Parents' educational attainment and family
                                      — 23 —




income, for example, are adequately described in Table 1. Some of the
other   variables listed in Table 1, however, do require additional ex-
planation.

        Family size is represented by the number of people in the family who

are   under 20 years of age at the time of the Cycle III interview (LESS2O).

Consequently, it may overstate or understate actual completed family size.

        Three measures   of the family's efficiency in producing healthy chil-
dren    are included in addition to the parents' educational attainment.

These are dichotomous variables that identify      youths whose mothers were

under    age 20 when the youths were born (LMAG),   youths from homes in which

a   foreign language is spoken (FLANG), and youths who live with their moth-

ers only (NOFATH). Young mothers are notoriously less efficient at con-

tracepting and may be similarly less efficient in producing healthy      of f-


spring. Foreign born families are likely to exhibit differences in

household productive efficiency. The absence of her spouse       from the

household    is likely to hinder the mother's allocative efficiency in se-

lecting the input mix with which to produce health. The absence of a

father also impinges upon the amount of time that a mother can      spend with
                17
her children.

         The youth's endowed health status is represented by four variables

relating to his early health. The first two (LIGHT1, LIGHT2) are dummy

variables identifying youths of low birth weight. Low birth weight is

 a typical indicator of a less healthy birth outcome (for example, Birch

 and Gussow 1970). Birth weight was obtained from the youth's birth

 certificate.    Since birth certificates are missing for approximately 25

 percent of the sample and    since   we do not focus on the effects of birth

 weight, we do not delete these observations. Instead, we include a
                                    — 24   —




dwmny variable that identifies youths with missing birth certificates

 (BWUK) in the regression estimates. The third endowment measure is a

dummy variable identifying youths whose mothers were over 35 years old

at the youth's birth (HMAG). The rationale for including this variable

is that older mothers are more likely to have offspring with health

defects. The last of these measures is a dummy variable which identi-.

fies youths whose parents reported a medical difficulty with the youth

before the age of one year (FYPH). Although parents' reports of youths'

medical problems before the age of one year are subject to recall error,

the first year of a child's life is likely to stand out in his parents'

minds relative to other stages in his life cycle. Therefore, we be-

lieve that the measurement error in this variable is small.

      Our current health indicator is used as a proxy for the child's

unmeasured genetic health endowment and his health history beyond age

one. This indicator is the presence of at least one significant abnor-

mality as reported by the HES physician who examined the youth (ABN).

Abnormalities include heart disease, neurological, muscular, or joint

conditions; other major diseases; and otitis media. Except for the

last condition, which constitutes a relatively small percentage of all

reported   abnormalities,   these health problems are to a large extent

congenital   and irreversible.
      We also   control   for several other characteristics of the youth which
are not necessarily health related but may cause him to receive better or
worse treatment within the family. They are his birth—order (FIRST) and
whether or not he is a twin (TWIN). First born youths      (or   non-twins)
will have greater access to individual parental attention because they
                                     — 25    —




arrived    in the family first (or they arrived alone). In addition, the

youth's age (AGE) and   sex (MALE) are      included in regressions in which

the dependent variable is not adjusted for age and sex (i.e. when the

dependent variable is either obesity, abnormal corrected distance

vision, preventive dental care, or preventive pediatric care).

        Finally, three region variables (NEAST, MWEST, SOUTH) and      four
sizes   of place of residence variables (URB1, URE2, URB3, NURB) are in-
cluded to control for regional differences that are not otherwise taken
into   account. We are agnostic about the nature of these differences,

but want to avoid the possibility that the        health manpower and fluo-
ridation effects are biased by an omission of unmeasured regional char-

acteristics.


                              III. irical Results
        In this section we present estimate equations (1) and      (3) and com-
pute the total impact of family characteristics and health manpower
availability on adolescent health as given in equation (4). Equations

(1) and (3) form a recursive system which can be        estimated using single
equation    techniques as long as ECu1 u3)       0. We make this assumption

here. Although all the dependent variables except the two oral health

measures    are dichotomous, the   method of estimation   is ordinary least
squares.    Preliminary investigation revealed almost no differences be-

tween ordinary least squares estimates and dichotomous ].ogit estimates

obtained by the method of maximum likelihood. When the dependent varia-

ble is dichotomous the fitted equation can be interpreted as a linear

probability function in which the regression coefficient of a given

independent variable represents the change in the conditional probability
                                         — 26 —




of    poor physical health or receipt of preventive care for a one—unit

change    in the independent variable. The resultant estimates also em-

body the assumption that several variables that may be considered

endogenous (mother's labor      force   status and   family   size, for example)

are    exogenous to adolescent health.18 Finally, our estimates cannot
be    unambiguously interpreted as production functions or derived de-
mand equations      because insufficient data forced us to use proxy mea-

sures for some of the explanatory variables.

         Estimates of the dental health production functions and the pre-

ventive    dental care demand function are discussed in the first part of

this section. The physical health production functions and             the   pre-
ventive pediatric care demand     function   are    discussed   in the second

part. Both discussions are centered on answering the questions posed

in    the introduction concerning the    roles    of the family, preventive care,
and health manpower availability in       determining    adolescent health. In
examining the results, it     is important   to remember that the five health
measures (APERI, IDECAY, OBESE, PVIS, ANEMIA) are negative correlates
of good health, so that negative effects of independent variables in the
production functions reflect factors associated with better health out-
comes. The two preventive medical care measures (DTPREV, DRPREV), on
the  other hand, are positive correlates of care; thus positive effects
of independent variables in the demand functions reflect factors asso-
ciated with higher propensities to obtain preventive care.

tive care demand function are in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. When the

number   of decayed permanent teeth (IDECAY) is the dependent variable, two
production functions are estimated. The first contains the same set of
independent   variables as the periodontal index (APERI) regression, while

the second includes APERI as an additional independent variable. It

has been   suggested   by Russell (1956) that variations in APERI result

largely from genetic factors. If these genetic factors are correlated

with the home environment and imperfectly measured by the health endow-

ment variables, the second regression will give a more accurate estimate

of the effects of the home environment on IDECAY than the first. Of

course, APERI has an environmental component as well as a genetic compo-

nent (as is evident from our estimate in Table               2).    Therefore, the two

IDECAY regressions contain upper and lower bound estimates                   of the impact
                                      19
of the environment     on   IDECAY.

      Most   notable among the results are the large significant impacts of
a preventive dental visit on both           the   periodontal      index   and   the   decay in-
dex.2°   The coefficient estimates imply that adolescents who did not have

a preventive check—up within the past year have periodontal indices and

decay scores that are each about .3 of a standard deviation worse than

adolescents who received a check—up. When APERI is included in the decay

equation, the decay differential between the two groups of adolescents

declines to .2 but remains statistically significant. To gauge the mag-

nitudes of these effects, recall that APERI and IDECAY have means of

approximately   zero and     standard deviations of approximately one. There-

fore, the oral health differentials associated with absence of preventive
care are relatively large; they range             from 20   to 30 percent of the stand-

ard deviations in the scores. Moreover, the differentials apply to a
                                            — 31   —




substantial proportion        of the sample:       30 percent of the youths in the

HES   did   not have a check-up in the past year. These findings underscore

the efficacy of preventive dental care.

        The results pertaining      to    a publicly provided form of preventive

care——water    fluoridation——are also strong. Youths exposed to           fluori-
dated water (FLUOR) have significantly better oral health than other
                                                            21
youths   at all conventional levels of confidence.               The fluoridation

differentials are smaller, however, than the corresponding preventive

dental care differentials in oral health. For example, the fluorida-

tion coefficient in the periodontal index equation is one-third as

large   as the preventive dental care coefficient. In the decay equa-
tions, the ratio of the two coefficients ranges from three—fifths to
two—thirds.        Nevertheless, given that the per—child cost of fluorida-

tion is substantially below        the    cost of a preventive dental visit,

this remains a cost—effective method of improving dental health.22
        Let us turn now to the role of the family in determining adolescent
dental health levels. The          four   characteristics of the family environ-
ment we focus on are parents education (MEDUCAT, FEDtICAT), family income
(FINC), family size (LESS2O), and mother's labor force status (MRKFr,
MWORKPT)    • An    overview of   the production function estimates in Table 2
reveals     that   all six variables have statistically significant effects in

the expected directions (with the exception of mother's labor force

status in the periodontal index equation). Children of more educated

parents have better oral health, as do children from families with

higher incomej while children whose mothers' are employed full—time or

who come from       larger   families have   poorer    health. The impacts   of   these
                                      — 32 —


variables      on IDECAY are reduced in absolute value when APERI is held constant,

but the pattern of statistical significance is not dramatically altered (only

the coefficient of father's schooling becomes insignificant). It is clear, then,

that these family characteristics have an important impact on adolescent dental

health.

        We interpret these findings as evidence that the home environment plays an

important role in determining children's health. It can be argued, however,

thatour results do not really constitute strong evidence in favor of "nurture"
because of the likelihood of positive correlations first between these family
characteristics     and the parents' health and second between the genetically deter-
mined components of parents' and childrens' health. Put differently, this argu-
ment states that family characteristics such as income or parental education
largely reflect genetic health factors. For exanmie, parents who are themselves
healthy are more likely to be in the labor force and will have higher earnings.
Or, parents who have had a healthy childhood and adolescence are more likely to
have attained a higher level     of education. Two   of our findings, however, cast
doubt      on the applicability of this argument in our case. First, when we include

APERI in the decay equation in an effort to more fully control for genetic factors,

we still find that these family environment variables have significant impacts on

IDECAY. This is noteworthy because the inclusion of APERI is likely to bias the

coefficients     of the family environment variables toward zero (see note 19).
       A   second and stronger reason revolves   around the coefficients of the educa-
tional attainment     of the two parents. If the education effect is primarily

genetic,     we would expect the coefficients of both mother's and father's education
to be equal because both parents make an equal genetic contribution to the child.
On the other hand, if the education
                                     — 33 —




effect     is primarily environmental, we would expect the impact of the

mother's education to be larger because she is the family member most

concerned with the children's health care. In Table 2 we observe

that in every case the coefficient of mother's education exceeds that

of father's education. In addition, despite a high correlation be—

tween the two education variables Cr          .61), the difference in coeff i—
                                                                           23
cients is always statistically significant at the 10 percent level.

Thus, our results clearly indicate that the family environment, and in

particular, the mother's education, plays an important role in pro-

ducing healthy children.

          Besides having an important impact on the production of health,

family characteristics work to improve adolescent health by increasing

the probability that an adolescent receives preventive care. In Table

3 we see that all six of the family variables have significant impacts

on the probability that an adolescent received preventive care. Chil-

dren from families    with higher annual income,    more educated   parents,
and in which the mother works part-time, are more likely to receive

preventive care, while children from larger families or families where

the mother works full—time are less likely to receive preventive care.

As   an   example of the magnitude of these effects, the probability that a

child received preventive care in the previous year increases by about

two percentage points for each additional year of education received by

the mother and declines by about three percentage points for each addi-

tional child in the family. Once again we believe that these results

reflect environmental rather than genetic influences the mother's

education coefficient is more than twice as large as the father's
                                           — 34   —




education        coefficient and   the difference between them is         statistically

significant Ct —        2.82).
         To determine the total        effect of family     characteristics on health——
both   the    direct effect embodied     in   the production function estimates and
the                              through the family's proclivity to ob-
      indirect effect that operates

tain preventive care--we compute the total impact of these family char-
acteristics in Table 4. The reported coefficients are analogous to the
                                          24
sum
       (8    +
                 83 cz1) in equation           Comparison of the coefficients in
Tables      3 and 4   indicates that the total        impact is from 10 to 100 percent

greater than the directM effect alone. We also                  observe, as before, a
large    and statistically  significant (at the 5 percent level) difference
between     the impacts of fathers' and mother's education, again lending

support     to our conclusion that Nnurture matters.
                                                     25

         With    regard to the role of health manpower,          we   see that it has     a

large significant effect on the family's propensity to obtain                    preven-
tive care        for its children (Table 3). An increase of one dentist per

thousand population increases the probability that adolescents visited

the dentist for preventive care in the previous year by 17 percentage

points. This estimate is identical to one obtained by Manning                     and   Phelps
(1978) and is       insensitive    to the exclusion of region and size           of   place of

residence from the equation.26 The implied effect on adolescent health

(assuming that dentist        availability has        no direct impact on adolescent

health but       operates only by increasing the family's propensity to obtain

preventive care) is given in Table 4 and ranges from —.036 to —.047 of a
                                                                27
standard deviation in the dental          health measures             Thus,   an increase

in the   number of dentists in an area by one            per   thousand population is

equivalent   in its effect on dental health to an increase in the level of

the mother's education by one and        one—third   years.

       It should be noted that the positive impact of dentists on the pro-

pensity   to obtain a check—up is unlikely to reflect demand manipulation
by dentists. The concept of demand manipulation refers to the           ability of

health   personnel to   shift the demand curve for their services, when all

direct and indirect costs of these services are held constant. In           his
extensive   treatment of this phenomenon, Pauly (forthcoming) shows that

the demand manipulation effect should be larger in a sample of consumers

with positive utilization than in a sample of all consumers. Moreover,

his model gives no basis for expecting a demand manipulation effect in

an equation that explains the probability          of a check—up. Based on these
considerations,    we view the dental manpower variable as reflecting the

importance of information, entry, travel, waiting, and direct costs in

the parents' decision to obtain preventive dental care for their of f—

spring.

       Most of the other results in Table 3 are consistent with our ex-

pectations and will not be discussed.28            We do wish to point out, how-
ever, that although fluoridation does have a significant impact on
dental health, it is not significantly related to the probability of
obtaining    preventive dental care. This is not surprising since from a

theoretical point of view either a positive or negative relationship

could be predicted. If fluoridation is regarded as an increase in the

child's health endowment, the quantity of care demanded should fall.

On   the other   hand, if   the   increased endowment also increases the   mar-
ginal product of preventive care, or if it lowers the psychic costs
                                     — 37   —




of obtaining care by reducing the severity of the tooth decay uncovered
by a preventive check—up, a positive effect on the quantity of care de-
manded would be predicted.29 Both types of results have been reported
in other studies. Manning and      Phelps   (1978) report mixed effects of
duration of exposure to fluoridation on the propensity to obtain pre-
ventive dental check-ups for white children below the age of 15 in a
1970 health survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center.

Upton and Silverman (1972) use 1966 data for 15 midwestern towns, half

of which used fluoridated water, and report fewer restorations of chil-

dren's permanent teeth in the fluoridated towns.

      We conclude this subsection by using our results to estimate the

impacts of three government programs to improve the oral health of

youths. First, consider a $1,000 income transfer to low—income families.

As shown by the reduced—form coefficients of FINC in Table 4, the trans-

fer would lower the periodontal index of youths from these families by

.01 points and would lower their decay index by .02 points. (Such a

program would naturally also have other beneficial effects on children

and their families.) Next consider a program to reduce or eliminate

regional differences in the number of dentists per thousand population.

Dentists   are   more numerous in urban areas than in rural areas •   To take

two sites in the HES, there     were 1.1 dentists per thousand population in
San Francisco, California, while there were .2 dentists per thousand

population in San Benito, Texas. Suppose that this difference were elimi-

nated by raising the number of dentists in San Benito by one per thousand

population. Then the periodontal index of youths in San Benito would fall

by .04 points, and their decay index would fall by .05 points.30 Finally,
                                           — 38   —




consider   an 80 percent reduction in the price of a dental check-up as a re-
sult of the enactment of a national health insurance plan for dental care
with a 20 percent co—insurance rate. Based on research by Manning and
Phelps on the impact of price on the propensity to obtain preventive
dental care for children and youths, we estimate that such a policy
would raise the probability of obtaining care by 16 percentage points.
This would improve both the periodontal and the decay scores by .04
          31
points.
        We view the      above computations as        illustrative rather than defini-
tive. To choose among the three programs, information on the cost of
each program      and   on the number of youths affected clearly is required.
Moreover,      as indicated in Section I, definitive computations of           impact
effects    should take account of the supply elasticity of dental care and

the exact nature        of   the relationship between dental manpower      and   the in-

direct costs of obtaining dental care.


B. Physical Health

        Estimates of the physical health production functions and the pre-

ventive care     demand function appear in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.
Looking first at the production function estimates, we are struck by the
fact that these physical health measures are              much   less amenable to sta-
tistical explanation than are the dental health measures. Of course,
lower   R2's   would be expected for the three physical health measures be-
cause they are dichotomous rather than continuous • But many fewer ex-
planatory variables are statistically significant in the physical health
case. Clearly unmeasured genetic or "luck" factors play a much larger
role in the case of these         health   measures.

      In   contrast to the results for preventive dental care, there is

little evidence that preventive medical care is efficacious. Youths

who saw a doctor for a check-up within the past year (DRPREV) have one-

half percentage point smaller    probabilities   of being obese or of having

abnornal corrected distance vision than other youths, and a one-fifth

percentage point higher probability of having anemia.      None of these

three differentials is statistically significant. One possible ex-

planation for these findings is that there are fairly long lags between
the receipt of preventive care and an improvement in physical health.
Alternatively, one might argue that physicians play a minor role in the

outcomes   studied here relative to unmeasured endogenous inputs such    as

proper diet. The non—significant impact of preventive care also means

that family characteristics operate on health only through the produc-

tion function. There   are   no indirect effects of the various family

characteristics on physical health, only direct effects. Consequently,

we do not present a table of "total" effects (comparable to Table 4) in

the case of the physical health measures.

      The relationship between family characteristics and health is

also much weaker in the case of physical health. Most of the six

family characteristics variables studied are not even statistically

significant in the production function; only the mother's education

and family size variables have significant impacts. Children of

more educated mothers are less likely to be obese or anemic, and they

are more likely to have poor vision (the latter relationship is not

significant). Children from larger families are more likely to have

poor corrected vision or be anemic, but they are less likely to be
                                     — 43   —




obese.    To get an impression of whether these effects can be viewed as

environmental     as opposed to genetic, we again look at the difference
between the coefficients of the two parent's education variables. For
both OBESE and M4EMIA,     the mother's education coefficient is larger
than the corresponding father's education coefficient, but for PVIS       the

opposite is true. Only in the case of obesity is the difference       sig-
nificant at the 10 percent level. Thus, in this case the evidence re-

garding    a nature versus nurture interpretation of the family effects
is   not conclusive, but it does suggest that with respect to obesity at

least one component of the family environment-—mother's education——has

an important impact.

         We   noted that the family size variable has a perverse sign in the
obesity equation: children from larger families are in better rather
than worse health in that they are less likely to be obese. The posi-
tive relationship between family size and       the incidence of the other

health problems is easy to rationalize (it may reflect a substitution
away from      higher "quality" children as the shadow price of quality

rises), 32 but a justification for the negative relation reported for
obesity is less obvious. One possible explanation for this negative
family size effect (as well as for the positive income effect) is the
existence of jàint production among various aspects of quality. For
example, families with fewer children or higher income may consume. more
rich and      caloric foods. This consumption raises some aspects of qual-

ity but at the same time makes obesity more likely.

         The finding of non—significant effects of family income in physi-

cal health      outcomes has important implications. First, it suggests that
                                         — 44   —




policies to improve the well—being of adolescents via income transfers
would have little impact on our physical health measures. Second, this
finding coupled with the significance of the mother's schooling variable
underscores the key role in health production of nonmarket productivity
as opposed to market goods and services as measured by family income and
preventive care. This result echoes our earlier findings for a group of
younger children (Edwards and Grossman 1980). In the case of obesity,
we believe that      the impact of mothers schooling        reflects the informa-

tion    that highly educated mothers have acquired as part of the schooling
proceag     about the dangers of obesity and about what        constitutes an

appropriate     diet.
           Family effects   in the derived demand   for   preventive pediatric care
(Table     6) tend to be much stronger than they are in the production func-
tions      (although the R2 in the preventive pediatric care equation is still

substantially lower than in the preventive dental care equation). 1mong

the six family variables, only the mother's labor force status variables

do   not   have a significant impact on the family's probability of obtaining

preventive     care. Families with higher parental education and more income
are more likely to get preventive care for their children while larger
families are less likely to. In addition, father's education has a larger
impact than mother's education. It is not clear how to interpret these
results, however, since we have no evidence that preventive pediatric
care is efficacious.
        The last result to be discussed concerns the role of pediatrician
availability. Similar to the corresponding findings for preventive den-
tal care, the numb.r of pediatricians per thousand population in the
                                        — 45 —




county of residence (PED) has a positive and statistically significant
regression coefficient in the demand        curve for   pediatric care. This

finding complements   those      reported by Kleinman   and   Wilson (1977) and

Colle and Grossman    (1978),      However, the implied effects of an increase

of one pediatrician per thousand population are small (-.003, -.003, and

.001 for OBESE, PVIS, and NEMIA, respectively), primarily because the

health impact of preventive care is small and not significant. Thus

our findings indicate that a policy to increase pediatric manpower in

medically underserved areas would not improve the physical health of

adolescents—at    least as   represented    by our   three measures •        Such a

policy should   be given a much lower priority than           a   analogous policy
to   expand dental manper in areas characterized by shortages.33

                           IV. Susmary and    Implications

       The purpose of this study has been to examine the              determinants

of the   oral and physical health of white adolescents with special

emphasis on the roles of family background and the             use   of   preventive
medical care. The main results of the study are (1) nurture plays an

important role in determining oral health but less so for the other

health problems studied; (2) preventive care          is efficacious in the

case of oral health but not for the other health problems studied;

and (3) the three physical health measures are largely unexplained by

the family and preventive care variables used here. Only mother's

education and family size have significant impacts.

       With respect   to   the   first result,mother's schooling is singled

out   as a crucial component of the home environment. Although mother's
schooling, father's schooling, family income, and family size all make
                                       — 46   —




 significant   contributions   to   oral health, mother's schooling dominates

 father's   schooling. Moreover, mother's schooling tends to dominate both

income  and father's schooling in the physical health equations, espe-
cially in the case of obesity. The finding that the impact of mother's
schooling almost always exceeds that of father's schooling is especially
important because equal effects would be expected if the schooling van-
ables were simply proxies for unmeasured genetic endowments.
      Two additional pieces of evidence underline the robusthess of the
finding that nurture Nmatters.u First, the relative magnitude of the
effect of the various family background variables on the index of tooth
decay is not greatly altered when the periodontal index, a proxy for
genetic oral health endowment,       is held constant.   Second, the identif i—
cation of a plausible mechanism by which family characteristics influence
adolescent health——preventive care——increases our confidence that these
variables reflect a behavioral effect as opposed to a genetic effect or
a statistical artifact.
      With regard to the role of preventive dental care, youths who re-
ceived a preventive dental check—up within the past year and youths ex-
posed to fluoridated water have much better oral health than other youths.
Moreover, the probability of a preventive examination is positively re-
lated to the number of dentists per capita in a youth's county of resi-
dence. This implies that a program to increase the availability of
dentists in medically deprived areas would improve the oral health of
youths in these areas. Indeed, we estimate that the payoffs to in-
creasing dental manpower by one per thousand population are about the
same as the payoffs to the coverage of preventive dental care under
national health insurance.
                                           — 47   —




        The   probability of obtaining a preventive check-up by a doctor            is

also   positively related to family income and        to   the number   of   pediatri..
ciana per     capita   in   the county   of residence. But we have little evi-
dence   that preventive care delivered to youths by physicians is eff i—

cacious in terms of their physical health. Therefore, the payoffs to

national   health insurance for physicians' services
delivered to youths. or programs to increase the availability of
doctors who     treat   youths are very small.
        Our results     for the physical health measures     are   weak, but one
pair   of findings does stand       out.   Adolescents are less likely to be

obese if their mothers are highly educated, and they are more likely

to be obese if they come from small families. The latter relation

provides a partial explanation of the dramatic increase in obesity

during recent decades since over the same period we have seen a

startling decline in family size. The former relation, on the other

hand, suggests a strategy for slowing down the trend in the incidence

of   this health   problem. What is needed is a public information pro-

gram——similar to that mounted in the case of childhood immunization——
directed at alerting less educated parents, and especially mothers, to
the dangers associated with childhood obesity.
        Overall, what our results suggest is that selective rather              than
general   programs would be most effective in improving the health of
the population under 18 years of age. For instance, instead of pro—
viding   complete   coverage for physicians services delivered to persons
from birth to age 18 under national health insurance, the government
should direct its attention at prenatal care and physicians servIces
                                       — 48   —




during   the first year of life. It is known that      appropriate   prenatal and

infant care can make a difference in terms of health outcomes          (for ex-

ample, Lewit     1977). Conversely, our results for oral    health in this

paper   and in   our   previous research (Edwards and Grossman 1980)    suggest

that   the payoffs to the coverage of dental care from the age it is first
received until age 18 or beyond would be substantial.

not   undergone the review accorded     official NBER publicationuj       in par-
ticular, it has not yet been        submitted   for   approval by the   Board of

        3children's health also depends on the prices of inputs used to

produce other aspects of their quality          and the prices of other forms
of parents' consumption.       The effects of these variables will not be

studied     here.

 Cofle        and Grossian (1978)          and Goldman        and Grossman (1978).

          5One   possible      objection to using this type of framework to analyze the

health of adole8 cents is that the goals of parents and youths are likely to
differ.          For instance,       cigarette smoking by             a youth might     increase his utility
but      reduce his parents' utility because it is detrimental to his current or

future health. This type of conflict between parents and youths has been

analyzed by Becker (1974) in the context of an economic model of social and

family interactions. He shows that such conflicts are important when the

parents'         utility function depends on particular "merit"                       commodities consumed

by    the youth rather than on               his   consumption of all            commodities.   In such a case
parents        have an incentive to allocate resources not only to their children's

consumption, but also to policing their offsprings' consumption patterns. An

explicit melding of our model with Becker's would be a difficult task, and

although         it would alter the interpretations of the effects of various family
characteristics, it would                not add to or delete from the list of relevant ex-

planatory variables.
          6
           Given the essentially arbitrary scaling of all of our adolescent health

measures and the general ignorance concerning the exact specification of a

health        production function, we believe that it is inappropriate to experiment
with more sophisticated functional forms.

          7The Bureau of Labor Statistics does collect measures of the prices of
various goods and services, including physician and dental office visits,
for 40        cities   and four nonmetropolitan areas.                    We   do not take price
 variables from this source because                      they are based on small samples.

and the sites in the HES survey are not identical to the sites in the
BLS survey. On the   other   hand, the number of dentists and pediatri-
cians are based on complete enumerations in all counties by the
American Dental Association and the American Medical Association and
can be matched easily to the lIES sites •   Thus   the two manpower vari-
ables have little measurement error, while the price estimates from
the BLS would contain a great deal of measurement error.

       8Thi8 is in contrast to the work of Newhouse and Priedlander (1977)
who fit an equation similar to our equation (4).

       9The term "allocative effect" and the decomposition of the school-
ing parameter into direct and allocative components is due to Welch
(1970). He   uses this framework to study the impact of schooling on mar-

ket production. Technically,    schooling is a relevant determinant of the
demand for medical care even if it has no allocative efficiency effect.
In simple models of schooling as an efficiency variable in household
production (Grossman 1972, Michael 1972), schooling raises the amount of
health output obtained from a given vector of inputs. In such models
schooling can lower the quantity of medical care demanded at the same
time as it raises the quantity of health demanded. In particular,
medical care would rise only if the income and price     elasticities of de-

mandfor offspring's health exceeded unity. We stress a model that in-
corporates an allocative efficiency effect because schooling should in-
crease the parents' knowledge about what constitutes an appropriate
diet, when to take their children to the doctor or the dentist for a
preventive check—up, how to follow the doctor's advice, and how to
                                              F-4


foster appropriate oral hygiene behavior by their children. The ability

of parents with extra schooling to select a better input mix, as well as

to obtain a larger            health   output from   given   inputs, is likely to en-

courage         them   to   demand larger quantities of preventive care even if the
income and price elasticities of health are less than one.                   In part the

effect      may reflect a substitution toward preventive care and away from
curative care.

           101n adopting these two criteria for the selection of health mea-
sures, we are guided in part by Kessner's (1974) tracer methodology
for studying the health of children and adolescents.

           1If the actual periodontal index of each age—sex group is normally
distributed, APERI            could   be translated directly into the youth's peri-

odontal         index percentile. Wa have experimented with the actual value
of the periodontal index as the dependent variable in a multiple re-
gression that includes age, the square of age, and a dummy variable for
male adolescents in addition to the remaining independent variables.
The results obtained (not shown) are similar to those reported in
Section III.
           12
            Dutton (1978) advocates the use of           a continuous,   rather than a
discrete, measure of anemia. She conducts a multiple regression analy-
sis   of   actual hematocrit levels of black children between the ages of
6 months and 4 years. The only statistically significant variables in
this regression (at the 5 percent level) are age and sex. Therefore,
it is not at all clear what we would gain by adopting                 her measure.
                                  F— 5



       13Similar patterns are present in the Cycle III data. Tanner (1962)
 stresses the importance of sexual maturity in the determination of the
 health and cognitive development of adolescents. Preliminary analysis
 revealed, however, that sexual maturity does not have an effect on our
 health measures except in the case of hematocrit levels of females.

       14Clinical evidence suggests that exposure to fluoridated water is
particularly important if it occurs during the ages at which the perma-
nent teeth are being formed (McClure 1962). These teeth do not appear
until a child is approximately 6 years-old but start to be formed a few
months after birth. Therefore, it is useful to identify youths who had
been exposed to fluoridated water before they reached the age of 6 years.
Unfortunately, we cannot do this because the youths current residence
alone is reported in the lIES.   We   did create a fluoridation variable
that identifies youths exposed before age 6 under the assution of no
migration, but it had no effect on oral health in regressions that in-
cluded the fluoridation variable described in the text.

            measure of the number of dentists excludes those in the
Federal dental service. The number of pediatricians pertains to
those in private practice.

      16Since pediatricians treat only children and youths, the number
of pediatricians per person under a certain age (say age 18) might
appear to be a more relevant measure than the number of pediatricians
per capita. We did not employ such a variable for several reasons.
First, the appropriate age cutoff is not obvious. Second, even if
pediatricians do not treat youths beyond the age of 17, s inc. mothers
                                         F—6


typically are      responsible    for taking youths to the physician, the mdi-

rect costs of obtaining pediatric care might be more related to the

number of pediatricians per woman with children below         the   age of 18

than   to     the number of pediatricians per person below   the   age of 18.

Third   and most important, there is little variation in persons under
age 18 as a percentage of the population or in women with children
under age 18 as      a percentage of the population among    the 38 sites in
the   HES.


         17The educational attainment of absent fathers is not known. For
children with      absent fathers, we code FEDUCAT at the mean      level of
father's      education in the subsample of youths who live with both parents.

This coding scheme is consistent with the assumption that father's edu-

cation has the same relationship with adolescent health whether or not

the father is actually present. An alternative assumption is that               fa-
ther's   education has no affect on adolescent health if he is absent.

Under   this assumption, the education of absent fathers would be coded
at zero. Use of the alternative coding scheme would alter the regres-
sion   coefficient of NOFATH but would not alter the coefficient of FEDUCAT

or the coefficients of other independent variables in the regression.

         18
              The health endowment variables are   also endogenously determined

because       they are affected   by family choices regarding prenatal care,

timing   of childbearing, and resources allocated to children since birth.
Despite       the endogeneity of the health endowment measures, mother's labor

force status, and family size, preliminary         computations revealed that
the   estimated coefficients of the other family background measures and
                                     F—7


of preventive care are only slightly altered by the exclusion of these
variables from the equations.

       9suppose that the periodontal and decay functions are

                    APERI —                           (1)
                               a1G+a2E+u1

                    IDECAY. b1G+b2E+u2            ,   (2)



where G is genetic oral health endowment, B is the home environment,         U1
and U2 are disturbance terms, and intercepts and other independent vari-
ables are ignored. Note that a1, a2, and b2 are negative since a more
favorable endowment or environment improves oral health. Solve equation
(3) for G and substitute into equation (2) to obtain


    IDECAY —        a1 APERI   + (b2 —      b1 a1) E + u2 —
               b1                      a2                     b1   a1 u1 .    (3)



Clearly, the absolute value of the parameter of B in equation (3) ii
mealier than the absolute value of the corresponding parameter in equa-
tion (2) •   Note   that APERI is negatively correlated with the composite
disturbance term (u2 — b1 a1' u1) in equation (3). Therefore, if the
equation is estimated by ordinary least squares, the regression coeff i-
cient of APERI is biased toward zero and that of B away from zero pro-
vided B and APBRI are negatively related. In the text we make the
plausible assumption that this upward bias in the absolute value of the
regression coefficient of B is offset by the fundentai difference be-
tween the structural parameters of B in equations (2) and (3). That is
                                           F—8


we   assume that the expected value of the regression coefficient of E
understates lb2I      even though   it overstates lb2 — a2 b1 al_il.
        20statements    concerning statistical significance in the text are
based on      one—tailed tests except     when the direction of the effect is
unclear   on a priori grounds       or when the estimated effect has   the

"wrong   sign." In the latter cases two—tailed tests are used.

         21      estimated effects of fluoridation on oral health are        not
           The

sensitive      to the omission of the three region and four size of place
of residence variables from the regressions. This indicates that the
fluoridation variable is not simply a proxy for location.
         22                               cites a report in the New England
              Consumer Reports   (1978)

Journal of Medicine which estimates the per           capita cost of fluorida-

tion to be about 10 to 40 cents per year (p. 393).


         23The relevant "t" statistics for the three equations in Table 2

are 1.41, 1.79, and 1.48. Note that probable biases in the estimates

of the two parents' education coefficients are likely to work towards

 a finding of no significant difference. The estimate of the direct

 efficiency effect of father's schooling may be biased away from zero;

 and the estimate of the direct efficiency effect of mother's schooling

may be biased toward       zero.    The former bias is introduced if father's

 education      serves as a proxy   for   permanent income (if there is measure-

 ment error in current family income). The latter bias is introduced if
 more educated wthers allocate less time to the production           of adolescent

 oral health because they have a higher opportunity cost of time, and              if
                                    F—9


the opportunity cost of time effect is not fully reflected by the two

measures   of mother's labor   force status. Along similar lines, the es-

timated father's   education effect may be biased upward in the demand
curve for preventive care. The mother's education effect is biased
downward if oral health is "time—intensive"     and   if substitution in
consuntion outweighs substitution in production.

        24These could be thought of as solved "reduced form" coefficients
of   the exogenous variables.


        25 is expected on the basis of the education coefficients in

Tables 2 and 3, the difference in "total" effects is larger than the

difference in direct effects. The test of the significance of the

difference   between the "total"   effect of mother's schooling and    the
"total"   effect of father's schooling is based on the estimated reduced
form——the ordinary least squares regression APERI or IDECAY on all the
exogenous variables • This procedure is employed because standard er-
rors of solved reduced-form coefficients and standard errors of differ-
ence between such coefficients are very difficult to compute. In every
case, the estimated reduced—form difference between the schooling co-
efficient is exactly the same as the solved reduced—form difference.
Therefore, the bias introduced by our test is minimal. The test sta-
tistics are 1.81, 2.23, and 2.82 for APERI, IDECAY, and IDECAY with
APERI, respectively.

        26Manning and Phelps estimate a discriminant function of the prob-
ability of obtaining a check-up. They point out that the coefficients
in this equation approximate logit coefficients •      Since   they do not
                                           F — 10




indicate   the mean probability of a check—up in their sample, we converted
their logit coefficient of the number of             dentists into a marginal effect

at   the mean check—up probability in the lIES sample               of .7. If in is   the

marginal   effect of a given independent variable, b is its logit coeff i-
cient, and   p is the probability of         a check—up, the conversion formula is



                             in   — bp(l—p)


        27The   finding   that the periodøntal index is inversely related to

the number   of   dentists differs from that of Newhouse              and Friedlander
(1977). Using adults        in   Cycle I   of   the lIES,   they   report an insignif i-

cant   positive effect of dentists per capita in the county of residence
on the periodontal index. Their result is based on an ordinary least
squares regression of the periodontal index on the number of dentists
and   other variables and does not embody the restrictions discussed in
Part C of Section I.
        28 There       two "perverse results
                 are                                  that are statistically significant:

youths from families in which         a foreign language is         spoken in the home

(FLMG) have better oral health than             other   youths, and     youths   whose

parents reported a medical difficulty with the               youth   before the    age of
one   year (FYPH) have less decay than other youths. The first of these
may be caused by genetic differences in oral health between native
Americans and immigrants or the native—born offspring of immigrants.
We offer no explanation for the latter finding.
                                    F — 11




         29Por a qen.ral discussion of endowment effects in models such as
the one enployed in this paper, see Tomes (1978) •   detailed treatment
                                                     A

of the role of fluoridation in dental care demand functions appears in
Upton and Silverman (1972).

         30The reduction in the decay score is taken from the reduced-form
coefficient of DENT obtained from the decay function that excludes
APERI.


             their discriminant estimate of the decision for white children
and youths to receive a dental exam, Manning and Phelps specify a price
effect that varies with family income. Our extrapolation of their ra—
suits assume (1) that family income equals $10,000 (the mean value in
the RES), (2) that the uninsured price of check—up is $15, and (3) that
the uninsured probability of a check—up is .7 (the mean in the HES).
The reduction in the decay score is obtained from the decay function that
excludes APERI.

      32Alternatively, these effects may be attributed to a reduction in
per capita income as family size rises with family income held constant.
Indeed, the sign of the family size effect is opposite that of the family
income effect in all three regressions. Yet something more than a mechan-
ical relationship between family size and per capita income is required
to account fully for the contribution of family size to health outcomes.
For example, unlike the family size coefficients, the family income co-
efficients are not always statistically significant. In addition, can-
putations reveal that the impact on physical health of a 1 percent
                                       F — 12




increase in family size is larger in absolute value than that of a 1 per-
cent increase in family income.

        33Some readers may object to the constraint in our recursive model
that the direct effect of health manpower on health is zero. For the
benefit of these readers, the estimated reduced—form coefficients of
the number of pediatricians on obesity, abnormal visiofl, and anemia are
—.316 Ct — —1.47), —.010 Ct — —0.07), and —.168 Ct           —1.57), respectively
The   estimated reduced—form coefficients of the number of dentists on the
periodontal   index and   decay   are • 128 Ct —   1.55) and .085 Ct   1.08),
respectively.   These coefficients give a very different and, in our view,

inappropriate picture of the payoff of a program to expand pediatric man-

power compared to a program to expand dental manpower.
