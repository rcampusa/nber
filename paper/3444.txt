     This study contrasts the ecornuic position of youths across local labor
markets that differ inì their rates of ursaploymant using the annual irarged
files of the O]rrent çulation Survey and the National lorqithdinal Survey
of Youth. The paper finds:
      (1) Local labor market shortages raise the employment-population rate
arid reduce the uneifloyment rate of disadvantaged youths by substantial
nnts.
     (2) Shortages also raise the hourly eantgs of disadvantaged youths.
In the 19805 the eaniings gains for youths in tight labor markets offset the
deterioration in the real and relative earnings of the less skilled that
marked this decade.
     (3} Youths in labor shortage areaa had greeter iocreases in earnings as
they aged than youths in other areas, implying that improved labor market
cz'nditions raise the lcngitiñinal earnings profiles as well as the starting
prospects of youths.
     These firrlirgs show that despite the social pathologies that plague
disadvantaged youths, particilarly less educated black youths, arid the 1980s
twist in the American labor market against the less skilled, tight labor
markets still operated to substantially improve their emarnuic position.

         Employment and Earnings of Disadvantaged Young }!en
                     in a Labor shortage Economy


     How do disadvantaged young man fare when there La a relative

shortage of labor? To what extent does low unemployment isprove
their employment and earnings prospects? Does a labor shortage
bring disadvantaged young black men, many of whom are viewed as
part of the "underclass", into the mainstream of the economy or
doea it pasa them by?

     This paper examinea theae questions for out-of-school young

men with twelve or fewer years of schooling in the l980s. Focusing
on youths vho have left school eliminates consideration of the

deoison to drop out of school and of the work behavior of students.

Focusing on young men eliminates consideration of how family
formation, fertility, the welfare system, and so forth affect the
labor market aotivity of yemen.   I treat high school graduates as
well as dropouts as disadvantaged because the eoonomio

opportunities for young male graduates deteriorated greatly in the
197Cm and 1980s.1

     My research strategy is to contrast the economic position of
young men across local labor markets that differ in their rates of
unemployment. To reduce the danger of making incorrect inferences

because of the sampling and other vagaries of a single data set, I
rely on data from two surveys: the annual nerged files of the

Current Population Survey (CPS) and the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY)2.



                                  1
                      Local Labor Market Shortages

     The rete   of unemployment was relatively high in the United

States in the 1980s, continuing the decade-by—decade increase that
marked the poet—world war II period3. But recovery from the 1952-

83 recession created major economic booms snd labor shortages in
several areae of the country, lsrgely though not exclusively in the

Northeast. The "Massachusetts Miracle" that achieved considerable
national publicity because of the preeldential candidacy of
Michael Dukakis was typical. Prom 1963 to 1987 unemployment in the

state was 3 percentage points lower than the national aversga;

personal income per capita and average hourly earnings in
manufacturing rose from below the national average to above it.      In

1987 when the rate of unemployment was 6.2 percent in the country

as a whole, the rate in the states' major city, Boston, was just

2.7 percent. From 1983 to 1987 the help wanted index for the city
rose more rapidly than for the U.S. as a whole. Help wanted signs
en store windows, want ads on radio and television, jcb

applications strategically placed at checkout counters of local
stores, extended waits for the earvices of skilled craftswor]cers;

and wages more than 50 percent above the minimum at feat food

stores confirmed the pervasiveness of the labor shortage. Many
other states and metropolitan areas also had levels of unemployment
that reflected labor shortages. In 1987 thirty-six metropolitan

areas had unemployment rates lower than 4 percent, and several —

including   Anaheim—Santa Ana, california; Stamford, Comnecticutt;
Nashua, New Hampshire — had rates lower than 3 percent. The
popular view of young blacks as residing in high unemployment
localities notwithstanding, some 22 percent of out—of-school young

black men with twelve or fewer years of schooling were in
metropolitan areas with unemployment rates lower than 4 percent.4

             Tight   Labor   Markets   and Youth Employment
     One expects   that in a tight labor market the proportion of

young people who are employed will increase and their unemployment
will decrease, absolutely and relative to adult employment or
unemployment. As new entrants to a labor market, youths constitute
a margin of adjustment for employers that makes hiring them
especially sensitive to the state of demand. Past studies have, in
fact, found that a 1 percentage point drop in adult unemployment

improves the job prospects of youths by more than 1 percentage
point, particularly among men5. Whether the employment of the
young with the fewest skills was as sensitive to labor market
conditions in the l9SOs, when the national labor market turned

against such workers, is, however, open to guestion.
     By contrast, neither theory nor previous empirical studies
tell us whether the pay of young workers will be higher or lower in

labor markets with low unemployment. On one side, the economic

theory of job search suggests that local labor markets with high
rates of unemployment should have high wages. The argument is that

wages in an area are largely determined by union policies, the mix

of industries in the area, cr government policies such as a

generous unemployment insurance system or, in the case of young

workers, the minimum wage. Unemployment adjusts to the given wage

                                       S
level. An area with high wages attracts migrants from other areas;
induces additional persons to participate in the labor force; and

creates long durations of unemployment as the jobless search for

the high-wage opportunities,   In equilibrium these labor supply

adjustments equate the present value of working across areas, which
requires that rates of unemployment be higher in areas with high
wages. Reinforcing this tendency is the fact that the youngest end
least skilled gain jobs when unemployment falls so that e

disproportionately large number of workers in areas with low

unemployment will be young and reletively unskilled, reducing the
average wage in those areas.

     on the other side, competitive pressures should lead employers
to increase wages in tight labor merket. If these pressures are
strong and persistent, they can cause wages to be higher in areas
with low unemployment.6 The active labor market hypothesis that
current market developments have a greater effect on entering

workers than they do on older workers who are relatively insulated

by implicit contracts, specific training, and seniority rules in
internal labor markets suggests further that the wages of young

people will be more responsive to economic changes than will other

weges, rising sharply in tight labor markets and declining sharply
in loose markets. In the 1970s the wages of the young showed just

such flexibility, falling in real and relative tens as the baby
boom generation entered the labor market.7 The tendency for wages
in low pay industries and occupations to increase when unemployment

fells also suggests that the wages of disadvantaged youths will be

                                 4
higher in markets with low unemployment, because these people
invariably begin their working lives in low wage industries and

occupations.
     surprising as it may seem to some, research on the relation

between wages and unemployment in the 197 Os found that unemployment
of adult workers was higher in high wage cities such as Detroit in
the industrial North Central region than in low—wage oities such as
Houston in the South or Southwest.8 This pattern did not, however,

hold for youths, whose unemployment rate was similar between high-

wage and low—wage metropolitan areas and whose ratio of employed
workers to the population wee lower in low-wage areas, possibly

because the federal minimum reduced youth employment most in these
areas.9 As the minimum wage, unionism, end other monmarket wage—

setting forces became less important in the 198Cc, one might expect

demand—side market pressures to dominate the relationship between
wages and unemployment in a way that they did not in the 19705.

                    Employment Patterns in 1987

     To determine how the employment and earnings of disadvantaged

young men varied with local labor market conditions in the 19805, I
contrasted the economic poeition of youths across metropolitan

statistical areas (HSAs), primary metropolitan statistical areas,
and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas with different

rates of unemployment.10 These three types of NSA5 are the most
disaggregate measures of geographic locale in the Current

Population Survey and thus of the local labor market in which a

person resides. In 1987 the cs identified 202 such areas. Rates

                                 5
of unemployment for these areas based on the full year's surveys
are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in each year's Nay

Emvlovment and Earnings and in the various editions of Geograo3iic

Profile of Employment and Unemnlcvnent.

     In analyzing the CI'S data I    categorized   MSAs into areas with
labor shortages —   those   with unemployment of 4 percent or less; and
into four additional groups - areas with unemployment rates of 4 to

5 percent, 5 to 6 percent1 6 to 7 percent, and 7 percent or higher.

I contrasted the labor market outoones for youths among these areas

in 1987 and compared 1987 outcomes with 1983 outcomes in the same
areas. I did this to control for the possibility that differences
in employment or earnings across areas in 1987 reflected the effect

on outcomes of relatively permanent area factore that have been
omitted from the analysis rather than the effect of 1987 local
labor market conditions. Under plausible assumptions the
difference between the 1987 and 1983 outcomes in areas classified

by 1987 unemployment removes persistent omitted factors and thus
helps identify the structural impact of a labor shortage on

outcomes.11 Unfortunately, extending the analysis back to 1983
limited the sample to the 45 standard metropolitan statistical

areas identified in the 1983 Merged Annual File.12 Because more
than half of the U.9 work force in this SM5A sample and because

results for the sample of 45 in 1987 are similar to those for the
full 202 MSA sample, I believe that the findings are not distorted.
        Table 1 shows the 1987 and 1983 percentage of unemployed and
employment—population rates and the 1983-87 changes in those rates

for all youths and for black youths in metropolitan areas
classified hy their 1987 levels of unemployment. The unemployment
rates for all youths were markedly lower in areas with low
unemployment in 1987. Unemployment rates showed relatively small

differences in 1983 youth unemployment hy 1987 area unemployment
rates. This suggests that the 1987 differences are due more to
1987 labor market conditions than to area characteristics that have

been omitted. Consistent with this, the 1983-87 change in rates
shows greater decreases in areas with low 1987 unemployment rates.
The employment-population ratios tell a similar story: youths had

higher chances of employment chances in low—unemployment areas,
though here the pattern is more uneven. In each group the increase
in the employment-population ratio is comparable to the decrease in
the unemployment rate. This implies that most of the arowth of

employment came from the mool of the unemplpyed rather than from
thcme   outside   the labor force.       The figures for black youths

tell a more dramatic story, particularly for areas having 4 to 5
percent and less than 4 percent unemployment rates. The
differences in unemployment rates and employment-population ratios
between tight and loose labor markets in 1987 are 15 to 20

percentage points as opposed to the S to 10 points for all youths.
The 198 3—87 changes in unemploymsnt and employment—population

ratios show, in addition, an extraordinary improvement in the
employment prospects for young blacks in the areas with labor

                                     7
shortages in 1987. Although the small numbers of black youths in
the various categories (roughly 150 in each) and the vagaries of

the CPS, which often produces sharp changes from year to year,
suggests that the magnitudes should be considered cautiously, the

pattern is clear and impressive; young blacks are anjor
beneficiaries of tight labor markets. Still, even in areas with
the least unemployment the unsmploymsnt rates cf black youth remain

markedly higher and the employment-population ratios markedly lower
than comparable rates for whites. In 1987 the black youth
employment-population ratio in areas with lees than 4 percent
unemployment is only marginally better than that for whites in

areas with unemployment rates of 6 to 7 percent.

      To see whether youth employment is more sensitive than adult
male employment to labor market conditions, I also calculated the

1983 and 1987 unemployment and employment-population rates for

adult males with twelve or fewer years of education. Those figures
show much smaller changes for adult man, implying that youth

employment is more sensitive than adult male employment to cyclical
swings. 13

      As a concise way to summarize the effect of area unemployment

on youth unemployment, I estimated s linear probability model in
which the dependent variable was a 0-1 dummy variable for whether a

youth was employed in 1987 and the independent variables were the
1987 NSA unemployment rate and measures of demographic
characteristics; age, years of schooling, and race. The resultant
regression coefficients and standard errcra (in parenthesis) on

                                  8
area unemployment were —.019 (.002) for all youths and —.043 (.007)
for black youths. Because the area unemployment rate is measured
in percentage points, the implication is that a 1 point decrease in

area unemployment raises youth employment by 1.9 points and     black
youth employment by 4.3 points. This supports the inference from
the means in table 1 that tight markets improve employment
prospects more for black youths than for white youths.

                              Hourly Earnings
     To see how tight labor markets affect earnings, I regressed

the log (=   natural   log) usual hourly earnings (the usual weekly
earnings divided by the usual hours worked per week) of young, less
educated, out-of-school men in 1987 on two separate indicators of

local area unemployment: categorical variables for 1987 area

unemployment or the unemployment rates themselves; and demographic
controls for the characteristics of the individual — age, age

squared, years of schooling, and race. In addition, to assess the
possibility that the results are due to area factors that were
omitted from the regressions, I performed two additional analyses
of the forty—five NSA sample. In one set of calculations I

regressed both 1983 earnings and 1987 earnings on dummy variables

for the category in which the area's unemployment rate fell in
1987. Under plausible assumptions the differences in the
coefficients on 1987 area unemployment between the 1987 and the

1983 regressions reflect the "true" effect of 1987 unemployment on
1987 earnings.14 In the other set, I regressed log earnings in
1987 and in 1983 on the rate of area unemployment in 1983 and 1987.
This also provided a control for area variables potentially omitted
in the analysis.15

     One further statistical point about the calculations, Because

area unemployment rates relate to groups with common group
components in their residuals, the standard errors in the
regressions are likely to be biased downward. Intuitively, this is
because the area differences reflect 202 or 45 independent

treatments rather than the thousands of observations the regression
program used to calculate the standard error. The degree of biae
depends on the correlation of disturbances within areas and the
average number of persons in each area.16 I have investigated the
extent of this bias using a random effects regression design, In
which the error term is modeled as 11. = e1+ v1 for area effect a1 and

where vjj is a residual with the usual properties.17 I fit this

nodal in a two stage procedure, first estimating the magnitude of
the NSA group correlations anrf then using generalized least squares

to estimate the earnings equation.15 I obtained results similar to
those in the least squares calculations in table 1.15

     Table 2 presents the coefficients end standard errors for the
impact of local labor market conditions on the log earnings of all

youths and of black youths in the cs samples. The upper portion
of the table reocrds the coefficients on dummy variables for four

of the five unemployment groups differentiated in table 1; the
omitted group comprises areas with the highest rates of
unemployment. The bottom portion of the table records the
coefficients from a regression in which I replace the dummy

                                  10
categories with the area unemployment rate in the 202 NSA eample

and with 1987 and 1983 area unemployment in the 45 NSA sample. The
results for all youths show a significant inverse relation between
unemployment and log earnings in 1987 that runs counter to the

positive relation between area unemployment end earnings found for
all, workers in the l970s. Earnings are markedly higher in areas
with less than 4 percent unemployment: the .18 coefficient on log

earnings suggests a 20 percent differential in youth earnings in
1987 between, say, Boston (with low unemployment) and Detroit (in
the highest-unemployment group). The results are much the same for
the smaller NSA sample. By contrast, the regression of 1983 ln

earnings on the same variables shows only modest differences among
youths in the sane areas. '    This   implies that the area pattern in

hourly earnings —   like   that in unemployment rates —   arose during
the economic recovery. Indeed, the difference between the
coefficients on 19s7 area unemployment from the 1987 and 1983

earnings regressions show that, corrected for the potential effect
of omitted area characteristics, youths in areas with especially

low 1987 unemployment had markedly higher 1987 earnings. Looking
at the underlying data, the geometric mean earnings for young men

in areas with less than 4 percent unemployment rose by 21 percent
between 1983 and 1987 compared to an increase of 10 percent for

those in areas with 7 percent or greater unemployment in 1987.
With a rate of inflation of 14 percent for the period, this implies
a sizeable real wage gain for youths in areas with labor shortages
compared with real pay losses in areas with high joblessness. In

                                      11
                                                                     .4


the late 1980s McDonald's and other fast food employers paid $5.00
to $6.00 per hour in markets with lebor shortages but minimum or

near minimum wages in areas with high rates of unemployment.
     The bottom portion of the table records the results of

regressing the log earnings of ycung men on the rate of area
unemployment in the 202 NSA sample and on the 1987 rate of
unemployment and the 1983 rats of unemployment in the 45 NSA
sample. The estimated coefficient on 1987 unemployment in the 202
NSA sample indicates that a 1 psrcentags point increase in
unemployment rates is associated with a substantial 2.9 percent
decreaas in hourly earnings. In the 45 NSA sample the estimated

coefficient on 1987 unemployment is -.025 on 1987 log earnings but

.012 on 1983 log earnings, implying e -.037 effect of unemployment
on log earnings corrected for the assumed omitted area factor. At
the same time, however, the coefficient on 1983 unemployment is
nearly identical in the two regressions, implying that differences

in unemployment rates across areas hed relatively little effect on

area earnings, possibly because aggregate unemployment was so high
in that year.

     The estimated coefficients show that tight labor markets had

an even greater affect on the earnings cf young blacks. In the
upper part of table 2, however, the hourly earnings of blacks
appear to rise sharply even in areas with more than 6 percent

unemployment. Because the sample size for blacks is relatively
small and the standard errors for the coefficients on the area

dummies in the 1983 regressions are sizeable, however, the more

                                12
useful estimates for black youths are from the bottom part of the
table. Here, the coefficient on 1987 unemployment in the 1987
regression ie roughly the same as for all young men but the
coefficient on 1987 unemployment in the 1983 regression is a
substantial .039. Taking the difference between these coefficents
as the best estimate of the effect of 1987 unemployment on the
earnings of black youth, I obtained —.060, which is markedly
greater than the effect of 1987 unemployment on the earnings of all

youtha   For black as well as for all young men, however, 1983

unemployment is estimated to have had a relatively modest effect on

hourly earnings.      -



     The higher coefficients on local area unemployment for black
youths than for all youths implies that racial differentials in

earnings are smslier in tight than in loose labor markets. For
example, the estimated coefficients on area unemployment of —.029
for all youths and of -.043 for black youths in the 202 MSA sample

imply that when the area unemployment rate is3 percentage points
lower black-white earnings differential are 4.2 percentage points
lower! = 3 x (.043-.029). Because the national unemployment rate

fell by roughly 3 points from l9B3 to 1987 one would expect a 4

point improvement in the earnings of blacks relative to those of
whites. In fact, the mean differential between the earnings of

black and all youths was virtually constant from 1983 to 1987. The
modest increase in the coefficient on the 0—1 black dummy variable
between the 1983 and 1987 earnings regressions (with area



                                13
unemployment held fixed) counterbalanced the effect of economic
recovery.

     All told, tables 1 and 2 show that tight local labor markets

substantially benefited less educated young men, particularly
blacks.

                         Longitudinal   Progress
     Do tight   labor markets increase the growth of young men's

wages or do they simply inprove prospects for being hired and raise
initial wage levels?

     Economic theory providea little guidance on what to expect.
Companies may find it profitable to offer additional promotion and

training opportunities to attract labor in a tight market, or they

may postpone training, producing slower increases in earnings as
workers age, because the market demands immediate production. To
verify the CPS finding that decreaaes in area unemployment increase

on youth employment and earnings, and to sea what happens to the

growth of individual earnings in a tight labor market, I examined

data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) on the
employment and hourly earnings of out-of-school young men with
twelve or fewer years of education. The age group covered by the
NLSY differs slightly from that in     the   CPS: the young men are 17 to
25 years old in 1983 and 21 to 29 in 1987. The geographic areas

covered also differ sonewhat because the ELSY file contains
unemployment rates both inside and outside metropolitan areas, I
treated both areas in this analysis. To control for any

differences in the economic position of youths caused by their

                                  14
place of residence, I included a dummy variable for urban status in

all regressions. Finally; to obtain the largest possible sample of
disadvantaged youths, I included young men from both the national

representative sample and from the spacial targeted subsample of

blacks, Hispanics, and economically disadvantaged whites. Because
the targeted subsample is not randomly drawn from the population,
coefficients on dummy variables for race may not reflect population
differences in outcomes by race. There is, however, no reason to
expect any bias in the estimated effects of area unemployment on
the employment and earnings of the disadvantaged.

     Table 3 records the estimated effect of 1983 and 1987 area

unemployment rates on youth employment, unemployment, and log
hourly earnings in 1983 and 1987. The results on employment and
unemployment for all youths yield a pattern much like that in table
i a positive cross—section relation between 1987 area unemployment
rates and 1987 youth unemployment. It also shows no relation

between 1987 area unemployment and 1983 youth unemployment,

supporting the interpretation of the 1987 cross—section pattern as

reflecting the effect of 1987 local labor markets on outoomes.
More important, the coefficient on 1987 area unemployment in the

1983 regression is a bare —.006, implying the absence of any
significant omitted area effect. In this case the estimate of the
effect of local market conditions based on the difference between

the 1987 and 1983 coefficients on 1987 unemployment is —.014. By
contrast, the estimated effect of 1983 area unemployment on the
youth employment—population rate hased on differences in

                                 15
coefficients between the 1987 and 1983 equations is of a similar
magnitude, .016. This implies that 1983 area unemployment has

virtually the same effect on 1983 employment-population rates,
controlling for 1987 employment—population rates, as 1987 area

unemployment had on 1987 employment—population rates, oontrolling
for 1983 rates: the reversal of sign reflects the fact that the
table reports both statistics in terms of the difference between

1987 and 1983. Similarly, when the outcome variable is youth
unemployment the estimates in columns 4 and 5 show that youth

unemployment in a given year depends almost entirely on that ysar'e
area unemployment rate. Here, the difference in coefficients
estimate for 1987 area unemployment is .016; while the comparable
estimate for 1983 area unenployment on 1983 youth unemployment is
.017 (the sign reversal again occurs because I report the statistic
in terms of the difference between 1987 and 1983). As in the CX'S

calculations, the similarity in coefficients between the enplynent

and unemployment regressions implies that the bulk of the response

to a tight labor market comes in the form of jobs for those looking
for work rather than from an influx of youth into the labor force.
Pinslly, the regressions of 1983 and 1987 log earnings on 1983 and
1987 area unemployment rates also oonfirm     the   CPS finding that

tight msrkets substantially raise the earnings of disadvantaged
youths. In fact, the estimated coefficients ere surprisingly
similar to   those   in the CX'S calculations of table 2: the —.023

effect of 1987 ares unemployment on 1937 log hourly earnings in the



                                    16
     NLSY is roughly the same as the -.029 and -.025 coefficients at the
     bottom of table 2.

          The table shove that tight labor serkets also raised blacks'

     employment and reduced their unemployment, But it does not show
     the markedly greater effect of local labor market conditions on
     outcomes that are found in the cPs data. Where the NLSY data finds
     greater sensitivity of the black economic position to market
    conditions is in earnings: the coefficients on area unemployment in
    the log earnings regressions for blacks are much larger than those
    for the sample as a whole. As in the CPS—based regressions,

    however, the coefficient on the 0-1 black dumny variable in the

    earnings equations is larger in absolute value in 1987 than in
    1983. In part this may be the result of the general pattern of

    rising between races in earnings as workers age. It also may
    reflect the 198 Os shift in earnings against lower paid workers in

    general (that is, one would expect lower 1983-87 changes in

    earnings for blacks simply because they were at lower wages in
    1983)20; and the gradual erosion of the earnings of young blacks

    relative to young whites that characterized the late 1970s and the
    l980a.21

         Finally, I exploited the longitudinal aspect of the NLSY by
    regressing changes in the log earnings of youths on 1987 and 1983

    unemployment rates, using the same control variables sa in table 3.
    This regression reduced the sample size moderately because some
4   youths   had earnings in 1983 and not in 1987 and conversely but had
    the virtue of allowing us to examina the same individuals in both

                                      17
 years. The estimated coefficients, given in table 4, conf irs     the
 implication of the cross—section analyses that youths in areas with

 low 1987 unemployment rates received noticeably largar increases in

 pay in the 1983-87 recovery than youths in areas with higher 1987
 unemployment rates. In addition, the difference in coeffioients
 between blacks and all youths indicates that, as in the CPS, blaok

 youths enjoyed especially rapid increases in earnings in tight
  labor markets. However, although these results show that improved
 market conditions affected longitudinal earnings profiles, they do
  not indloate how youth earnings grew in a persistent labor

  shortage.

Smamary   and   Implications
       The analysis of this study has round thet:

          Looal lebor market shortages greatly improve the employment

  opportunities of disadvantaged young men, substantially raising the

  percentage employed and redccing their unemployment rate.
  Employment of black youths is particularly sensitive to the state

  of the local labor market.

          Labor market shortages also significantly inoreesed the hourly

  earnings of disadvantaged youths, partioularly blacks. In the
  1950s the inorease for young men in tight labor markets were large
  enough to offset the deterioration in the real and relative

  earnings of the less skilled that marked these years.
          Youths in areas with labor shortages had greater increases in
  earnings as they aged than those in other areas, implying that
  improved labor market conditions raise the longitudinal earnings

                                     18
     profiles as well as the starting prospects of youths. Again, the

•    greatest gains were achieved by young blacks.

          These findings show that despite the social pathologies that

     plague disadvantaged young men, particularly less educated black
     youths, and despite the 1960s twist in the American labor market
     against leas skilled workera, tight labor markets substantially

     improved their eccnomic position. Although a strong job market may
     not be a panacea for all the problems of the disadvantaged, it doss

     improve their employment and earnings. In addition, the strong
    link between area unemployment and the economic position of black
    youths lends support to William J. Wilson's claim in The Truly

    Disadvantaged that many of the problems of the inner city are the
    direct result of the loss of jobs in local labor markets. if

    demographic changes produce the labor market shortages that many
    expect in the next decade, the enployaent and earnings of young,
    less educated male entrants into the labor market will improve

    markedly, and disadvantaged blacks will be special beneficiaries
    of these market conditions. For the country as a whole to attain
    the levels of unemployment in thoae areas that have shortags,

    however, would require the national unemployment rate, from the 5.5
    percent of the late 198 Os to the 3 to 4 percent that made the
    Boston and Anaheim areas of opportunity for disadvantaged youths.

    Whether this is possible without setting off a round of massive
    inflation, as most macroeconomists fear, is another.

of about 59,500 households from which the national unemployment
rate is derived. The CPS gathers data on average weekly earnings
and average hours worked from s subsample of households in each
month and gathars diverse other date.
     The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth is a detailed
survey of over 12,000 young people fros 1979 through 1987. The
orginal 1979 sample contained 12,606 youths aged 14 to 21, of
whom 6,111 represent the entire population of youths while 5,295
represent an oversampling of civilian Niapanic, black and
economically disadvantaged non—Hispenic, non—black youth. An
additional 1,280 were in the military. The aurvey had a
remarkably low attrition rate —— 4.9 percent through 1984 -— end
thus represents the largest and best available longitudinal data
set on youths in the period under study.

3. The unemployment rate averaged 4.5% in the l950a, 4.8% in the
1960s, 6.1% in the l970s, and 7.2% in the 19805. While
demographic factors explain some of the upward trend, there ia no
doubt but that the economic recession of 1982—83 created the
highest retes of joblessness since the Great Depression. Data
from the Council of Economic Advisors 1988.

files of the Current Population Survey that provide most of the
data in this paper.

10. An NSA is defined by the Census Bureau as "an urbsn area
that meats specified size criteria —— either it has a city of at
least 50,000 ithabitants     or it contains an urbanized area of
at least so,ooo inhabitants and has a total population of at
least 100,000." Primary end Consolidated MSAs are larger urban
metropolitan areas. For their precise definition see appendix C
of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, (1988).
     For ease of discussion I use MSA to refer to metropolitan
statistical areas, primary metropolitan statistical areas, and
consolidated metropolitan statistical areas.

11. To see the logic or this procedure, assume that there are two
groups of cities: those with high unemployment and those with low
unemployment. Outcomes depend on whether the youth lives in a
high— or low—unemployment area and on unobserved city
characteristics that happen to be correlated with the 1987 group
in which a city im found. If there is no correlation between the
1987 category and 1983 category in which a city falls, then the
only reason for differences in 1983 ycuth outcomes between cities
that differ in their 1987 unemployment category is the effect of
the unobserved city factor on outcomes. Henca, taking the 1983—
87 change in outcomes for cities in the same 1987 category
eliminates the effect of the omitted factor. If, more
realistically, there ia a positive correlation between a city's
1983 and 1987 cetegory, the difference estimator is likely to
ul)derstate the true effect of 1987 market conditions on outcomee.
12. Stendard metropolitan stetisticel arees are the geographic
equivalent of the MSAs used to identify areas in the 1983 CPS.
They are beeed on 1970 Census of Population definitions, whereas
the MSAs are based on 1980 Census of Population definitions. I
matched the relevant areas for comparability.

14.   Let the true relation between area unamployment (U) end the
outcoma variable (Y) be I = B U + B A + a, whore A is the
oaittod area varieble. The expected velue of the regression
coefficient of I on U is then B + B b,1,, where b is the
regression coefficient of the omitted area variable on area
unemployment.
     Now consider the regression of I' on U, where '1' is the
outcome in a different period of time t'. In this regression I
have omitted A and U', the unenployeant rate in V period.
Assuming that U has no true   effect on I',the regression
coefficient of I' on U is: 0 + B b1 + B b,,,, where B reflects
the influence of the omitted variable Ti' on I'.
    Then, if bu',, = 0, the difference between the regression
coefficient of I on U and of I on U' is just B. If buU is not
zero but rather positive (unemployment across areas is correlated
 over time) ,        the    difference in coefficients underestimates B by 1—
b,.,,

15. In this analysis one can obtain an estiaste of the effect of
area unemployment on outcomes by subtracting the coefficient on
the 1997 unemployment in a 1983 outcome equation from the
coefficient in a 1983 outcome equation. One can also obtain an
estimate of the effect of area unemployment on outcomes by
subtracting the coefficients on 1987 and 1983 unemployment in the
two separate outcome equations.
In the first case, consider the regression, coefficients of the
outcome variables '1 or V on U and U' in regressions in which
there is an omitted area variable A. The coefficients in the
regression of I on U and U' are
               =
        b,.         b,,,.,.1 +      b4,, and
        yt.u       by,,,j +        b4,.,
Similarly,
are
                   the coefficients in the regression of I' on U and U'

               =            +        b4,,,, and   -   -
                           + b4,,,. b,,,,
The true equation in each period is I =                   BU   + B,A + a.   The
expected value of the coefficient of U in the regression of I on
U and U' is B +        be,, The expected value of the coefficient
of U in the regression o? 1' on U and U' is       b,,,, because U
does not enter the equation for I' except as a proxy   for the
omitted area variable. Hence the difference between the
coefficient on U in the regress iun of I on U end U' and the
coefficient on U in the regression of I' on U end U' should be B.
     Alternatively, since the expected value of the coefficient
of U' in the regression of I on U and U' is b4,,. b,,, if
the                                                       "d" b,,,
    difference between the coefficients of U ahd U' 'in this
regression should also be B. I have not exploited this estimate
in the paper. i have also not combined all of the information in
the four estimated coefficients to obtain e single B and s single
"omitted variable" effect.
