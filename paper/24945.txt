                                          ABSTRACT

Only half of SAT-takers retake the exam, with even lower retake rates among low income and
underrepresented minority (URM) students. We exploit discontinuous jumps in retake
probabilities at multiples of 100, driven by left-digit bias, to estimate retaking’s causal effects.
Retaking substantially improves SAT scores and increases four-year college enrollment rates,
particularly for low income and URM students. Eliminating disparities in retake rates could close
up to 10 percent of the income-based gap and up to seven percent of the race-based gap in four-
year college enrollment rates of high school graduates.

       U.S. college enrollment varies substantially by income and race. In 2016, 83 percent of students

from high-income families enrolled in college immediately after graduating from high school,

while only 67 percent of students from low-income families did so (McFarland and Hussar, 2018).

Over 70 percent of White high school graduates immediately enroll in college, compared to 56

percent of Black high school graduates. When low income and underrepresented minority (URM)

students enroll in college, they are disproportionately likely to do so at colleges with relatively low

graduation rates and low expected earnings, such as two-year community colleges.1 One partial

explanation of such disparities comes from informational and procedural complexities in the tran-

sition to college, which disproportionately impact students who lack the resources or guidance to

navigate college processes as effectively as their more advantaged peers (Page and Scott-Clayton,

2016).

       College entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT are one source of complexity. Although

much has been written about the decision to take a college entrance exam for the first time (the

extensive margin), we know very little about students’ decisions to retake such exams (the inten-

sive margin). Only 54 percent of SAT-takers retake the SAT at least once, implying that nearly half

of students never retake.2 Those who do not retake appear at a competitive disadvantage, given

that retaking is strongly incentivized by current admissions practices of U.S. colleges. Nearly 75

percent of four-year colleges that use SAT scores in the admissions process publicly claim to con-

sider only a student’s maximum score.3 Over 80 percent of those define that maximum as the

superscore, the combination of the highest scores a student receives on each section of the exam,

even if those scores occurred at different takes. For three-fourths of colleges, retaking can only

improve students’ chances of being admitted by making their applications more competitive.

       In this paper, we assess the consequences of SAT retaking for student achievement, with a

panic, or Native American.
   2
     Retake rates are even lower for the ACT, the other major American college entrance exam. Only 41 percent of
2009 ACT-takers retook the exam, a proportion that rose to 45 percent by 2015. Many of the associations we document
between SAT-retaking, demographics and test scores also appear in the ACT. See the ACT’s 2016 Technical Brief entitled
“Multiple Testers: What Do We Know About Them?”, by Matt Harmston and Jill Crouse.
   3
     The remaining 26 percent of colleges that use all SAT scores in the admissions process tend to be more selective
than those using maximum scores. See the College Board’s 2015 publication “SAT Score-Use Practices by Participating
Institution”, in which the College Board surveyed all SAT-using colleges about their admissions practices. The cited
percentages are conditional on being in the 87 percent of colleges with a valid response.

focus on the differential effects of retaking across demographic groups. Our analysis has three

parts. First, we analyze which students take up the opportunity to retake the SAT. We show that

retake rates increase with initial SAT scores across most of the distribution, falling only above the

95th percentile. Retake rates increase with income but are also higher for low income students who

use waivers that render retakes free, suggesting that financial costs may deter some students from

retaking.4 Female students are three percentage points more likely to retake than male students

and Asian-American students are 12 percentage points more likely to retake than White students,

differences robust to conditioning on a rich set of covariates. URM students are nine percentage

points less likely to retake than White students, a gap only partly explained by income differences

between those two groups. Students who take their first exam at an earlier date are more likely to

retake, in part because they have more opportunities to do so.

       Second, we estimate the causal impact of retaking on both test scores and college enrollment.

Relative to those who do not retake, retakers may believe their first take is not as reflective of their

true abilities, may be generally more motivated, or may be better informed about the benefits of

retaking, all of which would confound attempts at causal inference. To eliminate endogenous

retaking, we borrow from behavioral economics and psychology literature that observes people

focusing disproportionately on the leftmost digits of numbers when making decisions. Pope and

Simonsohn (2011) first observed such behavior in the test-taking context, using lumpiness in the

distribution of maximum scores to infer that students scoring just below multiples of 100 must

retake the SAT at higher rates than those scoring at or above such round number thresholds.5

       We confirm this finding directly: students with first SAT scores just below a multiple of 100

are, on average, one percentage point more likely to retake the SAT than students with scores just

at or above that number. Discontinuities in retaking rates appear at almost all multiples of 100,

ranging in magnitude from 0.5 percentage points at lower thresholds to 12 percentage points for

the highest threshold. These thresholds serve as exogenous sources of variation in retake rates,

      Students are eligible for such fee waivers if they receive or are eligible for federally subsidized school lunch, receive
public assistance, live in federally subsidized public housing, or are homeless. To get the waiver, a student must contact
a school counselor or authorized community-based organization that confirms the student’s eligibility.
    5
      Their data, a 25 percent sample of SAT scores from 1996-2001, lacked explicit measures of retaking and college
enrollment outcomes.

motivating a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of retaking on SAT

scores and college enrollment, with retaking instrumented by an indicator for scoring just below

a multiple of 100.

   The impact of threshold-induced retaking on SAT scores is substantial. On average, retake

scores are 0.15 standard deviations higher than first take scores (46 points on a 2400 point scale).

Retaking once improves students’ admissions-relevant superscores by nearly 0.3 standard devia-

tions (90 points). For students who initially score in the lower half of the SAT distribution, retaking

once boosts superscores by nearly 0.4 standard deviations (120 points). Higher-scoring students

see meaningful but smaller test score gains, in part because of ceiling effects. Retaking increases

the SAT scores of low income and URM students by more than it does for their high income and

non-URM counterparts.

   The score increases resulting from retaking are large enough to drive substantial improvements

in college enrollment outcomes, particularly for low income and URM students. On average, re-

taking increases the probability of enrolling in a four-year college by 13 percentage points, driven

in large part by substitution away from two-year colleges. Retaking also improves the quality

of colleges students attend. These effects are even larger for low income and URM students and

substantially smaller for high income and non-URM students.

   Retaking also improves college quality, inducing students to attend colleges with historical

B.A. completion rates six percentage points higher than they would otherwise. It does so by

shifting enrollment from non-selective, low completion rate (often two-year) colleges to somewhat

more selective, higher completion rate four-year colleges. Enrollment in the most selective, highest

graduation rate colleges does not change. Because it does not alter application patterns to the

colleges where enrollment shifts are observed, retaking most likely changes college choices by

increasing the odds of admission through increased SAT scores.

   The college enrollment effects of threshold-induced retaking are large. This may be partly

explained by the fact that taking the SAT itself indicates interest in four-year colleges, so that

SAT-takers may generally be less constrained financially or otherwise than non-takers. SAT-takers

induced to retake by missing a round number score may also be unusual. We show that compliers



                                                  3
do not differ much by income or race from the average retaker but acknowledge that students with

target scores may differ along unobservable dimensions. If compliers are particularly motivated

to attend four-year colleges, our estimates may provide upper bounds for the enrollment effect of

increasing retaking among wider populations.

   In the third part of our analysis, we combine calculations from the first two parts to show that

retaking behavior can explain a substantial fraction of college enrollment gaps. Among the SAT-

taking population, low income students are 21 percentage points less likely to retake, yet doing

so increases enrollment at four-year college enrollment by 30 percentage points. This implied six

percentage point effect (0.21 * 0.30) represents 25 percent of the four-year college enrollment gap

between low and high income SAT-takers. A similar calculation shows that retaking explains 14

percent of the four-year college enrollment gap between URM and non-URM SAT-takers. Because

roughly half of high school graduates do not take college entrance exams, the proportion of col-

lege enrollment gaps among all high school graduates explained by retaking is roughly half the

proportion within the SAT-taking population. Our calculations suggest that disparities in retake

rates explain up to 10 percent of the income-based gap and up to seven percent of the race-based

gap in four-year college enrollment rates of high school graduates. These calculations ignore any

potential general equilibrium effects, driven by actions of colleges or other students, that might

result from substantial increases in retake rates of low income and URM students.

   Our results suggest that individual students, particularly low-scoring, low income, or URM

students, should likely retake college entrance exams more than they currently do. Though our

data is too recent to measure retakers’ completion rates with precision, evidence from other con-

texts suggests the shift from two-year to four-year colleges and the general improvement in quality

of college chosen will lead to higher degree completion rates (Goodman, Hurwitz and Smith, 2017;

Cohodes and Goodman, 2014) and higher labor market earnings (Zimmerman, 2014; Canaan and

Mouganie, 2018).

   Our paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we highlight one part of the college

enrollment process that contributes to socioeconomic gaps in educational attaintment but has re-

ceived relatively little attention. Most recent research has focused on students’ decisions about



                                                4
whether to take college entrance exams. For example, states mandating the SAT or ACT as part

of accountability systems increased exam-taking rates and meaningfully improved four-year col-

lege enrollment rates and the selectivity of colleges chosen, particularly for URM students (Klasik,

2013; Hurwitz et al., 2015; Goodman, 2016; Hyman, 2017). Opening exam testing centers near stu-

dents’ homes also increases test-taking and college enrollment rates (Bulman, 2015). This body of

research on first-time exam taking suggests both that some students underestimate their college

readiness and that relatively small costs can dissuade such students from taking college entrance

exams.

   Retaking has received much less attention. Vigdor and Clotfelter (2003) use data on applicants

to three selective U.S. colleges to study the predictors of retaking, arguing that retake-induced

score increases are too large to be explained by selection and must represent increased familiarity

with the test or actual learning. Frisancho et al. (2016) use data from the Turkish college entrance

exam to similarly argue that retaking generates familiarity- or learning-based gains that are larger

for less advantaged students, thus potentially narrowing socioeconomic gaps. We build on this

small literature by using data on the universe of over 10 million SAT takers from the high school

classes of 2006-2014 both to document predictors of retaking and, more importantly, to provide

the first causal estimates of the impact of retaking on college enrollment.

   Our second contribution is to the behavioral economics literature. We add to the research on

“left-digit bias”, which has been shown to operate in car and housing sales (Busse et al., 2013;

Lacetera, Pope and Sydnor, 2012) and athletic performance (Allen et al., 2017; Foellmi, Legge

and Schmid, 2016). The example of college entrance exam retaking is particularly striking as

it demonstrates large real-life consequences of left-digit bias. This work also adds to a broader

literature on behaviorally-based public policy interventions. Our results suggest that students

underestimate or undervalue the expected benefits of retaking compared to its small apparent

costs. Such costs include a few hours of test-taking time, study effort, and a fee that ranges from

$0 for low income students, who qualify for a fee waiver that renders the first two takes free,

to about $50-$60 for higher income students. The retaking of college entrance exams may be a

margin ripe for the type of behavioral intervention that has generated interest in public policy



                                                 5
generally (Chetty, 2015) and in education policy specifically (Lavecchia et al., 2016; Levitt et al.,

2016). We discuss a variety of potential interventions in the conclusion but note that encouraging

or requiring students to take their first exam earlier might be particularly effective, given that

many low income and URM students do so in 12th grade when few retaking opportunities remain.



1       Data and Descriptive Analysis

For descriptive purposes, we begin with student-level data from the College Board on the universe

of nearly 14 million students from the high school classes of 2006-14 who had valid scores on all

three sections of the SAT: math, critical reading, and writing. For purposes of causal inference,

we include in our regression discontinuity sample the 12 million of those students who first took

the SAT by November of senior year and thus had at least one opportunity to retake prior to

graduating high school.6

        For each student, we observe SAT math, reading and writing scores from all takes, as well as

the timing of those takes. This allows us to construct first total SAT scores across all three sections,

as well as the superscores most commonly used by college admissions offices. Each SAT section

is scored on a scale of 200 to 800 in multiples of 10, so that total SAT scores can range from 600

to 2400.7 For these cohorts, the SAT was offered seven times a year and students could retake the

SAT as many times as their college application timeline allowed. Each SAT take during this time

cost roughly $40-$60, with low income students who applied for and received fee waivers eligible

to take the exam twice at no cost. We observe whether each student used such a fee waiver, as well

as self-reported demographic information on gender, race, parental education and family income.

        Our main outcome of interest is college enrollment, which we observe via a merge between

the College Board data and the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), which tracks enrollment

choices of 94 percent of U.S. college students. We assign students to the first college they enroll

in within 180 days of high school graduation and characterize colleges both by sector (four-year

vs. two-year) and by expected graduation rate and later income. We use the NSC data to compute

    Students who first took the SAT later than that have extremely low retake rates.
    7
    Our data cover a roughly ten-year period during which the SAT comprised three sections scored on a 2400 point
scale. Beginning in 2016, the SAT has two sections and a 1600 point scale.

each college’s expected graduation rate as the fraction of students in our data who initially enroll

in a given institution and who earn a B.A. anywhere within six years. Relative to graduation

rates available through the Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

System, this measure has the advantage of existing for all colleges and being comparable across

the two- and four-year sectors.8 We use data from from Chetty et al. (2017) to characterize the

expected income of each college’s initial enrollees at ages 32-34.9 We also observe all colleges to

which a student ultimately sends SAT scores, a decent proxy for college application behavior given

that many colleges require standardized test scores as part of their admissions process (Pallais,

2015; Bond et al., 2018; Smith, 2018).

       Table 1 shows mean characteristics of the full sample, the subset who first took the SAT by

November of senior year and thus comprise our regression discontinuity sample, and three sub-

samples of interest: lower scoring students, defined as those whose first SAT score is closest to

or below the median threshold of 1500; low income students, defined as those with self-reported

family income below $50,000; and underrepresented minority (URM) students, defined as those

who report their race/ethnicity as Black, Hispanic or Native American. Among the full sample,

27 percent are URMs and 21 percent are low income. Twenty percent of students used a fee waiver

on their first SAT take, making the exam free.

       First SAT scores average 1475 with maximum SAT scores over 50 points higher. Fifty-four

percent of students retake the SAT at least once, and some more than once, so that the mean

number of takes is over 1.7. On average, students first take the SAT about 12 months before high

school graduation, in May or June of junior year. Though not shown in the table, 69 percent of

students give themselves substantial time to retake by first taking the SAT in 11th grade, while

29 percent first take it in 12th grade.10 Fifty-seven percent of SAT-takers first enroll in a four-year

college within 180 days of high school graduation and another 18 percent enroll in a two-year

college. The regression discontinuity sample looks fairly similar to the full sample, though with a

      To deal with selection into college, students who do not immediately enroll in any college are assigned the mean
six-year B.A. completion rate of all students who do not enroll immediately after high school graduation. For more
detailed discussion of these measures, see Goodman, Hurwitz and Smith (2017).
    9
      We use the baseline income measure favored by Chetty et al. (2017), which measures the 2014 income of each
college’s initial enrollees from the birth cohorts of 1980-82.

      Two percent first take the SAT in 9th or 10th grade.

higher retake rate (61 percent compared to 54 percent) and a higher four-year college enrollment

rate (61 percent compared to 57 percent). The three subsamples come from lower income families,

have lower SAT scores, retake less often and are less likely to enroll in four-year colleges.

    Table 2 shows predictors of retaking from a linear probability model that regresses a retaking

indicator on various covariates. A few clear patterns emerge in the top three panels. Low income

students are 21 percentage points less likely to retake than high income students. This could be

driven by differential ability to afford the costs of retaking or by differential college preferences or

perception of the benefits of retaking. URM students are 9 percentage points less likely to retake

than White students, a gap partly but not solely explained by income differences across these

groups. Asian students are 12 percentage points more likely to retake than White students and

female students are three percentage points more likely to retake than male students, differences

robust to inclusion of further controls.

    The bottom panel shows that those with higher first SAT scores are actually more likely to

retake the SAT, a pattern we explore in more detail in the next section.11 Though initially higher

scoring students may have less need to improve their scores, such students tend to be more ad-

vantaged along a number of dimensions that predict higher retake rates. Students who use fee

waivers are more likely to retake, suggesting testing fees may affect low income students’ propen-

sity to retake. High retake rates among fee waiver users might also be driven by positive selection

as the most informed and motivated low income students seek such waivers.

    Each month earlier that a student first takes the SAT is associated with a more than four per-

centage point increase in retaking probability, even controlling for all the aforementioned factors.

Early takers are more likely to retake in part because they have more opportunities to do so. The

timing of a student’s first take is also the single most powerful predictor of the probability of re-

taking. Controlling for such timing quadruples the predictive power of this regression model,

raising its R-squared from five to 20 percent. Though not shown in the table, over 40 percent of

URM students first take the SAT in 12th grade, compared to just over 20 percent of white and
   11
      The relationship between first SAT score and retaking is fairly linear across all but the very top of the score dis-
tribution, so that our descriptive conclusions are substantively unchanged when controlling for higher order terms in
first SAT scores.

Asian students, explaining some of the difference in retake rates by race. All of this suggests that

encouraging students to take their first test at an earlier date may be a channel through which to

increase retake rates.



2        Methodology

The propensity to retake the SAT is strongly correlated with observed student characteristics but

is also likely correlated with unobserved characteristics such as true ability, motivation or infor-

mation about the college admissions process. As such, even conditional on variables observed

in our data, the relationship between retaking and college outcomes is probably biased upwards

by the fact that highly motivated or well-informed students are both more likely to retake and

more likely to enroll in college. Estimating the causal impact of retaking requires an exogenous

source of variation that affects retaking but is not related to students’ underlying characteristics.

We exploit the fact that the distance of a students’ first SAT score from the nearest multiple of 100

provides such a source of variation.


2.1        Regression Discontinuity Specification

We estimate the impact of round-number thresholds on retaking with a regression discontinuity

design that fits linear specifications around each such threshold, similar to a linear spline speci-

fication but with additional flexibility built into the model. To do so, we generate two identical

observations per student containing demographic information, SAT scores from each take, retak-

ing measures, and college enrollment outcomes. The existence of multiple thresholds means that

each student’s total SAT score from the first take falls in between two multiples of 100 (or on one

such multiple). For one of the student’s two observations we generate regression discontinuity

variables defined relative to the threshold to the left and for the other observation by the thresh-

old to the right.12

         We generate three such variables. The first, R, is defined in one observation as the nearest
    12
     All students appear twice in the data except for a small number who appear once because of first SAT scores below
the lowest threshold (700) or at or above the highest threshold (2300).



                                                          9
round-number threshold at or below a student’s first SAT score and in the other observation as

the nearest threshold above that score. The second, the running variable D, is defined as the

distance between a student’s first SAT score and R, which can take on values between -100 and

90. The third, Below, indicates whether a student’s first SAT score falls below R or, equivalently,

whether for that observation D is negative. For example, a student whose first SAT score is 1270

would appear in one observation with R = 1200, Below = 0 and D = 70 and in the other with R =

1300, Below = 1 and D equal to -30.13

    Our first stage regression takes the form:

                                      23
                                      X
       Retookir = βF S Belowir +           [Rn00 ∗ (αn00 + γn00 Dir + δn00 Belowir ∗ Dir )] + µcd + ir          (1)
                                      n=7


The outcome Retook indicates that student i near round-number threshold r retook the SAT at least

once. The variable Rn00 indicates an observation being defined relative to threshold 100*n, so that

the summed terms in brackets represent 17 local linear regression discontinuity specifications, one

at each threshold from 700 to 2300. The three terms within brackets flexibly allow each threshold

to have its own intercept, slope below the threshold, and slope above the threshold. This re-

sembles a linear spline specification that would use one observation per student but, unlike that

specification, does not impose the restriction of a single slope between each threshold. Instead,

each student is allowed to contribute to the estimation of one slope for the threshold below and

one slope for the threshold above her first score. Relative to a linear spline, this specification im-

poses fewer functional form assumptions but has lower precision because nearly twice as many

coefficients are being estimated.

    The first stage coefficient of interest, βF S , averages across all 17 thresholds the predicted dif-

ferences in retake rates between those scoring just below and just above a threshold. Because

students just on either side of the threshold are nearly identical in terms of academic skill and

other characteristics, we interpret this coefficient as the causal impact on retaking of just missing a

round number score. High school class by first SAT date fixed effects µcd control flexibly for class

      As an example of a student whose first score is a multiple of 100, consider one who initially scored 1200. That
student would appear in one observation with R = 1200, Below = 0 and D = 0 and in the other with R = 1300, Below = 1
and D equal to -100.

and test date-specific factors such as time trends in retaking behavior, selection into first test dates

by different types of students, and varying exam difficulty over time.

       Our ultimate goal is to estimate the impact of retaking on these SAT and college outcomes. To

do so, we generate instrumental variable estimates of the form:

                                    23
                                    X
            Yir = βIV Retookir +         [Rn00 ∗ (ζn00 + ηn00 Dir + θn00 Belowir ∗ Dir )] + νcd + ξir               (2)
                                    n=7


where Retook is instrumented by the indicator Below, as in equation 1.14 We focus primarily on

two sets of outcomes Y , measures of subsequent SAT performance and measures of college enroll-

ment, including the sector and completion rate of college chosen. The coefficient of interest, βIV ,

thus estimates the impact on SAT scores and college outcomes of the retaking driven by students’

reactions to round-number thresholds.

       This flexible local linear specification allows us to use bandwidths ranging from 20 (below

which we have only a single point with which to estimate a line) to 100 (above which our data

cross additional thresholds that may affect estimation). We split the difference between these

two extremes and choose 60 as our default bandwidth, but show in extensive robustness checks

that the linearity of the data means our results are not sensitive to this choice.15 Because our

running variable is discrete, we cluster standard errors in all of these regressions by first SAT

score as suggested by Lee and Card (2008). Clustering by first SAT score also accounts for the fact

that some students have two observations in the stacked version of the data. We show later that

our results remain statistically significant without clustering and remain robust to bandwidths of

50 and below, where each student is observed only once. Consistent with the earlier observed

smoothness of covariates, we show that our results are robust to controlling for students’ income,

race, gender and parental education. Our specification also yields estimates extremely similar to

those from a traditional linear spline specification.
  14
      We implement this using two-stage least squares but find that, because our instruments are quite strong, limited
information maximum likelihood estimation yields indistinguishable results.
   15
      The regression specifications above also allow us to choose different bandwidths at different thresholds. The lin-
earity of the data again mean such choices make little difference to our estimates.

2.2     First Stage

Figure 1 plots the fraction of students retaking the SAT as a function of first SAT scores. Retake

rates rise with first SAT scores across most of the distribution, peaking above 65 percent for those

with scores in the 1800-2000 range and then dropping for first scores above 2000, the 95th per-

centile of the distribution. Students whose first SAT score falls just below a multiple of 100 are

more likely to retake the SAT than those whose score is that multiple of 100. These difference in

retake rates are largest and visually clearest for the higher thresholds but also appear at many of

the middle and lower thresholds in denser parts of the distribution.

      Figure 2 makes this visually clearer with the stacked version of the data, where the running

variable is the distance of each student’s first SAT score from the nearest multiple of 100. Aver-

aged across all the thresholds, students just below a round-number threshold appear about one

percentage point more likely to retake the SAT than those just above that threshold. The first row

of Table 3 provides the first stage estimate of that discontinuity from equation 1, suggesting that

students first scoring just below a round-number threshold are 0.9 percentage points more likely

to retake the SAT than those just above that threshold.

      Figure 3 shows the point estimates and standard errors from running this first stage model at

each individual threshold, rather than averaging them into a single estimate. Sixteen of the 17 in-

dividual thresholds generate statistically significant variation in retake rates. Consistent with the

raw retaking data, we see large retaking impacts of falling below higher thresholds and smaller

impacts of falling below lower thresholds. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 average these effects across

the two halves of the initial score distribution, showing that retake rates increase by 0.6 percent-

age points for lower scoring students and 1.4 percentage points for higher scoring students. The

impacts of missing thresholds on retake rates varies less by income and race.

      Missing round-number thresholds induces more than one retake attempt on average for com-

pliers, perhaps because they have target scores that a second take fails to achieve or because they

learn that retaking is less costly than they had previously believed. The second row of Table 3

runs a version of the first stage regression where the outcome is the total number of takes rather

than an indicator for retaking. Such coefficients always exceed their counterparts in the first row.


                                                 12
The third row provides instrumental variables estimates the impact of threshold-induced retaking

on the total number of takes, the ratio of the first and second row coefficients. Compliers retake

the SAT about 1.3 times on average, with lower scoring compliers retaking upwards of 1.4 times.

The remainder of this paper uses as a treatment variable the indicator for retaking the SAT at least

once because we lack independent variation in whether a student retakes once or more than once.

Nonetheless, if we assume treatment effects are linearly increasing in the number of takes, subse-

quent estimates can simply be divided by 1.3 (or the relevant subsample coefficient) to generate a

“per-retake” treatment effect.

    These thresholds provide extremely strong variation in retake rates. The first stage F-statistic

exceeds 180 for the entire sample and exceeds 70 in all of the subsamples we study, far above tra-

ditional thresholds for potentially weak instruments (Staiger and Stock, 1997). Though the instru-

ment is strong, the first stage is small in magnitude, raising potential concerns that compliers may

be an unusual subset of the population. The bottom panels of Table 3 compute the mean charac-

teristics of compliers, as suggested by Abadie, Angrist and Imbens (2002) and Abadie (2003), and

of the whole sample for comparison. Relative to the population of SAT-takers, compliers have

higher first SAT scores, look indistinguishable in terms of income, and are somewhat less likely

to be URM students. Across the subgroups, compliers generally have higher first SAT scores than

the mean student, are equally or more likely to be low income, and appear similar in terms of

racial composition. Though this does not exclude the possibility that compliers are unusual with

respect to unobservable characteristics such as motivation, these results suggest compliers do not

appear to be outliers along observable dimensions.

    That students appear to have round number target scores is not surprising. The top two results

from a Google search for “Should I retake the SAT?” lead to web pages that advise “you should

have an exact target score in mind” and “having a concrete score in mind can be a powerful mo-

tivator.”16 Students’ focus on round number thresholds may arise from irrational left-digit bias.

It could also be a rational response to the perceived left-digit bias of admissions or financial aid

processes, which may explicitly use round number thresholds to determine eligibility or implic-

itly overweight scores’ first digits due to the mental processes of admissions officers with heavy

workloads (Bowman and Bastedo, 2017).


2.3      Validity Checks

For the regression discontinuity approach to yield valid treatment effect estimates, students must

not be able to precisely control the relationship between their first SAT score and round-number

thresholds. Details of the test itself suggest no scope for such potential manipulation. The SAT is

scored centrally and the scale translating raw scores into scaled scores is unknown to test-takers.

       Two pieces of empirical evidence are consistent with this. First, we see no heaping at values

just above or below round-number thresholds, suggesting no systematic imbalance in the number

of students to the left and right of each threshold.17 Second, students just above and below the

thresholds appear quite similar in terms of the demographic characteristics we observe.18 All

available evidence suggests that students just above and below the thresholds are identical except

for their retaking rates.

       We provide two further pieces of evidence that students care specifically about their total SAT

scores with respect to retake decisions. First, retaking rates were discontinuous at round-number

thresholds on the 1600 point math and reading scale that existed prior to the introduction of the

third section on writing. When that third section was introduced, retaking discontinuities as mea-

sured on the 1600 point scale largely vanished.19 Retake rates also show no discontinuities at

round-number thresholds from scores on individual sections of the SAT.20 All of this is consistent

with students primarily reacting to their total SAT scores, the measure most frequently highlighted

by college admissions offices.

       Whether round-number thresholds provide a valid instrument for SAT retaking depends also
  17
     See Figure A.1, which plots the density of observations and appears smooth at all thresholds.
  18
     Table A.1 shows instrumental variable estimate from equation 2, using demographic characteristics as outcomes.
Across a variety of bandwidths, we see no statistically significant relationship between threshold-driven retaking and
income, race, parental education, or gender. Figure A.2 shows estimated instrumental variable coefficients at indi-
vidual thresholds. Differences in such characteristics are very close to zero and statistically insignificant at nearly all
thresholds.

on whether they satisfy the exclusion restriction, affecting outcomes only through retaking and

not through other channels. For outcomes such as maximum SAT scores, the exclusion restriction

is clearly satisfied because retaking is the only channel through which such scores can change. For

college enrollment outcomes, we note potential channels other than retaking through which such

thresholds might have an effect.

         College admissions and financial aid processes may exhibit left-digit bias because of explicit

rules or implicit biases of application readers. If so, scoring just below a threshold will disadvan-

tage students by reducing their chance of admission or financial aid. Left-digit bias from individ-

ual colleges is unlikely to be empirically important because of the national scope of our sample

and our use of so many different thresholds. We also later rule out the possibility that individ-

ual states’ public postsecondary systems’ admissions or financial aid rules might be driving our

results. This channel suggests that missing a threshold could harm a student’s college outcomes

for reasons other than retaking, making our instrumental variable estimates of retaking impacts

downward-biased and thus lower bounds on true effects.

         Regardless of whether colleges actually exhibit left-digit bias, students may believe they do. If

so, missing a threshold could discourage students from applying for admission or financial aid or,

conversely, could encourage them to work harder on admission and aid applications on margins

other than their SAT score. These reactions have opposing effects on college outcomes, making it

ambiguous as to the sign of the bias for instrumental variable estimates of retaking impacts.



3         Results

3.1        Admissions Relevant SAT Scores

Retaking induced by round-number thresholds substantially increases students’ SAT scores. Table

4 shows the impact of retaking on four outcomes: most recent total score after two potential takes;

superscore after two potential takes; superscore after all takes; and the probability that a student’s

final superscore exceeds her first superscore by at least 150 points (0.5 standard deviations).21
    21
         Table A.2 shows the reduced form impact of missing a round number threshold on SAT scores.



                                                            15
Column 1 shows that, on average, retakers’ total scores are 46 points higher on their second take

than on their first take, suggesting real gains either through learning or increased familiarity with

the test. The magnitude of this round number threshold-induced gain is remarkably similar to the

44 point gain the average retaker achieves between the 1st and 2nd tests. This provides another

indication that the compliers driving our estimates are not unusual relative to the average retaker.

       Superscoring makes retaking even more effective, with retakers’ superscores increasing by

88 points, nearly twice as much as their total scores rise. With additional retakes, superscores

ultimately rise by 102 points, with 24 percent of retakers seeing superscore gains of at least 150

points. This superscore increase among compliers is again remarkably similar to the 100 point

increase in superscores that the average retaker achieves after completing all takes. Comparing

columns 2 and 3, the ratio of superscore gains between the final and second takes is less than the

1.3 retakes induced among compliers. This suggests diminishing marginal benefits of retaking,

with the magnitude of this implying that the first retake increases superscores by about twice as

much as subsequent retakes. Improvements in SAT scores come from all three sections of the

test, with about 50-60 percent of retakers raising their scores on any given section and 20 percent

raising their score on all three sections.22

       On average, retaking improves scores for all students but particularly for those with lower

initial scores. Figure 4 shows by individual threshold the estimated impact of retaking on ultimate

superscores.23 We see statistically significant superscore gains from retaking at each threshold,

with higher gains for initially lower scoring students. Panel B of Table 4 confirms this pattern. Low

scoring students’ second take total scores are 91 points higher than their first, relative to an only

22 point gain for higher scoring students. On average, retaking ultimately increases low scoring

students’ superscores by 136 points, relative to 84 points for higher scoring students. The scores

of low income and URM students tend to increase more from retaking than the scores of their

high income and non-URM counterparts, though this heterogeneity is lower than that by initial

SAT score.24 For all subsamples, the magnitude and statistical significance of retaking’s impact on

      We exclude the lowest three thresholds (700-900) because the small number of students near these thresholds lead
to noisier treatment effects that distort the scaling of the graph.

      Retaking does not appear to have heterogeneous impacts by gender on SAT scores or subsequent outcomes, so we

ultimate superscores is remarkably robust to choices of bandwidth, inclusion of covariates, and

decision to cluster standard errors by initial SAT score.25


3.2    College Enrollment

Retaking meaningfully improves college enrollment outcomes, including four-year college enroll-

ment rates. As shown in Table 5, retaking the SAT increases the probability that a student will

enroll in a four-year college by a statistically significant 13 percentage points.26 This represents a

nearly 20 percent increase over the 67 percent enrollment rate among control compliers. Roughly

half of that increase is due to a shift away from two-year colleges, while the other half comes

from students who would not otherwise have enrolled in college. This magnitude seems large

but aligns quite closely with another recent study of the impact of Boston’s charter schools on

SAT scores and college enrollment. Angrist et al. (2016) estimate that attending a charter school

in Boston increased students’ SAT scores by about 100 points and immediate four-year college

enrollment by 13 percentage points, much of which represented substitution away from two-year

colleges. Our estimated impacts of retaking on both SAT scores and college enrollment are nearly

identical to these magnitudes, suggesting the enrollment increase we observe is reasonable given

the SAT increase we observe.

      Retaking causes students to enroll in colleges with completion rates six percentage points

higher than they would have otherwise, in part because four-year colleges have higher comple-

tion rates than two-year colleges. This improvement in college quality, as measured by graduation

rates, comes from a nine percentage point increase in the probability of attending colleges with

graduation rates of at least 50 percent, the roughly median graduation rate of colleges attended by

SAT takers. We see no change in enrollment at colleges with graduation rates of at least 80 percent,

the roughly 80th percentile of the college quality distribution. Characterizing college quality by

expected income yields qualitatively similar, though noisier, results. Retaking increases expected

income by a statistically insignificant $700 and the probability of attending a college with roughly
do not report these results.
  25
     See Table A.4.
  26
     Table A.5 shows the reduced form impact of missing a round number threshold on college enrollment.



                                                       17
median expected income ($50,000) by a marginally significant eight percentage points, but has no

clear impact on the attending colleges above the 80th percentile of the expected income distribu-

tion ($65,000).

      Retaking’s positive impact on college enrollment outcomes is driven almost entirely by lower

scoring students. Figure 5 shows threshold-specific estimates of the impact of retaking on enroll-

ment in four-year colleges. Near the higher thresholds, retaking has little impact on four-year

college enrollment. Near the lower thresholds, point estimates are large, positive and sometimes

statistically significant. Panel B of Table 5 shows the pooled versions of these estimates. Retaking

increases the probability that lower scoring students attend a four-year college by 33 percentage

points, a near doubling from a baseline 39 percent attendance rate among compliers. Two-thirds

of this increase comes from students who would otherwise have attended two-year colleges. For

lower scoring students, retaking increases the graduation rate of their chosen college by 14 per-

centage points, driven entirely by movement from below to above median quality colleges. Retak-

ing increases lower scoring students’ expected income at ages 32-34 by a statistically significant

$6,900, a nearly 20 percent increase relative to control compliers.

      Conversely, we see little impact of retaking on higher scoring students’ college outcomes. For

such students, the estimated impacts of retaking on college enrollment and quality are generally

close to zero in magnitude and never statistically significant. One possible explanation is that,

based on their control complier mean outcomes, higher scoring students have less room for im-

provement of college outcomes. Over 80 percent of such students enroll in four-year colleges,

with at least 40 percent enrolling in colleges at or above the 80th percentile of graduation rate and

expected income.


3.3     Heterogeneity by Income and Race

Retaking improves college outcomes for low income and URM students much more than it does

for high income and non-URM students. For low income students, retaking increases four-year

college enrollment by 30 percentage points, nearly all of which substitutes for two-year college

enrollment. Low income students who retake attend colleges with 16 percentage points higher


                                                  18
graduation rates. They are roughly 30 percentage points more likely to attend colleges of above

median quality, as measured both by graduation rates and by expected income. We see little

evidence of improvement in college outcomes for high income students. Retaking has roughly

double the impact on the four-year college enrollment rates of URM students than of non-URM

students, raising the former by 20 percentage points and the latter by eight percentage points.

Heterogeneity in the impact of retaking on college by race is less clear than by income or initial

score.

       The heterogeneous impacts of retaking by income are not simply explained by the fact that

low income students have lower initial scores on the SAT than do high income students. To show

this, Table 6 explores heterogeneity by income and race among only lower scoring students. Panel

A suggests that, even among only those with initially lower scores, retaking improves college

enrollment and quality much more for low income students than for high income students. Con-

versely, panel B suggests that heterogeneity in retaking’s impacts by race are largely explained by

racial differences in initial SAT scores. Among lower scoring students, retaking improves the four-

year college enrollment rates of both URM and non-URM students by about 30 percentage points.

Point estimates on college quality measures suggest, if anything, greater benefits of retaking for

non-URM students in this lower scoring sample.27


3.4     Robustness Checks and Degree Completion

The estimated impacts of retaking on college enrollment and quality are robust to changing the

empirical choices made in our baseline specification. Figures A.5 and A.6 show the sensitivity

to bandwidth choice of the estimated impacts for the entire sample and the three subsamples of

most interest. The magnitude and statistical significance of retaking’s impact on four-year college

enrollment and chosen college’s graduation rate are stable across bandwidths ranging from 30 to

100 SAT points, the maximum bandwidth usable between thresholds. Tables A.7 and A.8 show

that, across the whole sample and all subsamples, estimated impacts of retaking are robust to:
  27
     Table A.6 explores heterogeneity by income and race among only higher scoring students. Point estimates are
larger for low income students than high income students among higher scorers but the standard errors are too large
to infer much with respect to heterogeneity.



                                                        19
choice of bandwidth; flexibly controlling for gender, race, family income and parental education

through fully-interacted fixed effects; and choice to cluster standard errors by first SAT score or

not.

      These enrollment impacts are likely not confounded by the use of round-number thresholds in

state public colleges’ admissions or financial aid processes. In theory, publicly known admissions

thresholds could confound our estimates given that Goodman, Hurwitz and Smith (2017) show,

in the context of Georgia’s public four-year colleges, that some students retake specifically to gain

admission to a particular college or sector. Though some states use SAT score thresholds to partly

determine admissions or merit aid eligibility, few of these states use round-number thresholds.

Furthermore, all such eligibility criteria that we could identify, including Georgia, are based on

scores from just the math and reading sections of the SAT, not the three section total score studied

here. In case we have overlooked an empirically important state program that might violate our

exclusion restriction, we generate estimated impacts excluding each of the 10 largest states in our

data one at a time. Table A.9 shows that no single state is responsible for our primary results, mak-

ing it unlikely that state-specific policies are confounding our estimates of the impact of retaking

on college enrollment.

      We cannot infer much about degree completion, as seen in Table A.10. We can observe six-year

completion rates for only the first three cohorts in the sample, which weakens our instruments for

the subgroups whose enrollment rates are positively affected. Though estimated impacts on de-

gree completion are noisy, they are generally quite similar in magnitude to the estimated impacts

on expected completion based on college-level graduation rates, particularly for lower scoring

and low income students.


3.5     College Application Behavior

Retaking the SAT boosts four-year college enrollment rates, in large part by shifting enrollment

from two-year to four-year institutions. There are two primary explanations for why this might

occur. First, by increasing admissions-relevant SAT scores, retaking may strengthen students’

college applications and thus increase their chances of admission at four-year institutions that are


                                                 20
at least somewhat selective. Second, retaking may change the set of colleges to which students

apply. This might occur either because each retake allows students to send their SAT scores to up

to four colleges for free or because students’ higher scores change their expectations about where

they might be admissible.

       Though we can not observe admissions decisions, we do observe application behavior as prox-

ied by score sends. Table 7 shows instrumental variables estimates of the impact of retaking on

the number of colleges to which students send their SAT scores. We divide colleges into three cat-

egories corresponding to important enrollment margins observed earlier, those with graduation

rates below 50 percent, between 50 and 80 percent, and above 80 percent. The first two columns

show little evidence of changing application behavior to the colleges where we previously ob-

served changed enrollment rates. Point estimates are generally small, negative and statistically

insignificant, particularly for the disadvantaged subsamples where we observe increased enroll-

ment.28 This suggests that retaking shifts students from below average to above average col-

leges not by changing application behavior but by increasing the strength of applications students

would have sent anyway.

       We observe reductions in applications to colleges with the highest graduation rates. We sus-

pect this is not the impact of retaking. Instead, scoring below round-number thresholds may

discourage students from applying to highly selective colleges where they perceive such small

score differences can reduce their admissions chances (Bond et al., 2018). This fact is less relevant

to lower scoring students, who rarely apply to or enroll in highly selective colleges and for whom

retaking’s effects appear largely on the margin between non-selective two-year and less selective

four-year colleges. Reduced applications to highly selective colleges suggest, however, that our

instrument may cause us to underestimate the impact of retaking for the college choices of higher
  28
     In our data, each additional score send to colleges with graduation rates below 80 percent is associated with a 3.2
percentage point increase in the probability of attending a four-year college (controlling for a cubic in first SAT scores).
To understand how much reduced application numbers due to missing round number thresholds might downward
bias our enrollment estimates, we multiply this by the 0.1-0.6 decrease in score sends observed in total across those
first two columns for various subgroups. This suggests that reduced applications would drive only a one percentage
point decrease in overall enrollment, even less for disadvantaged subgroups, and less than a two percentage point de-
crease for advantaged subgroups. This would not materially affect our conclusions about retaking’s impact on college
enrollment.

4        Gaps in SAT Scores and College Enrollment

4.1        SAT Score Gaps

We use the estimated impacts of retaking on SAT scores to model what portion of income and

racial gaps in admissions-relevant SAT scores would be closed by eliminating disparities in retake

rates. The main assumption required to model this is that the marginal students induced to re-

take by a future intervention would have similar test score gains to the average complier. This

assumption seems plausible given that compliers have similar test score gains as the average re-

taker, though newly induced retakers could differ in ability or willingness to study or otherwise

prepare for the second take.

         Raising the retake rate of low income students to that of high income students would close

about nine percent of the admissions-relevant SAT score gap by income. To show this, we begin

with the fact from Table 2 that low income students are 20.6 percentage points less likely than

high income students to retake. Our estimates in Table 4 imply that retaking once increases the

superscores of low income students by 109 points. Inducing 20.6 percent of low income students to

retake once would thus boost the average superscores of low income students by 23 points (0.206

* 109). This represents nine percent of the 250 point gap in superscores between low and high

income students. This lower 227 point income gap we estimate under equalized retake rates is

remarkably close to the actual 226 point gap in first SAT scores.30 This suggests that our estimates

of the extent to which retaking contributes to income-based gaps in SAT scores is reasonable.

         A similar exercise suggests that equalizing retakes rates by race would close about four per-

cent of the gap in admissions-relevant SAT scores between URM and non-URM students. URM
    29
      Each additional score send to colleges with graduation rates above 80 percent is associated with a 2.6 percentage
point increase in the probability of attending a four-year college (controlling for a cubic in first SAT scores). Multiplying
this by the observed decreases in score sends to such colleges suggests that reduced applications would drive a four
percentage point decrease in overall enrollment, or a three percentage point decrease for low income and URM students.
The latter number is quite small relative to the estimated impact of retaking on those subgroups, again suggesting the
bias from this channel does not meaningfully alter our conclusions.
   30
      For detailed income and race gaps in retake rates and SAT scores, see Table A.11.

students are 11.3 percentage points less likely to retake than non-URM students and retaking once

increases the superscores of URM students by 94 points. Inducing 11.3 percent of URM students to

retake once would boost the average superscores of URM students by 11 points (0.113 * 94), which

represents about four percent of the 269 point gap in superscores between URM and non-URM

students. Again, this lower 258 point gap we estimate under equalized retake rates is fairly close

to the actual 252 point gap between URM and non-URM students in first SAT scores.


4.2     College Enrollment Gaps

We also use the estimated impacts of retaking to model what portion of income and racial gaps

in four-year college enrollment would be closed by eliminating disparities in retake rates. This

requires two assumptions. First, as with our SAT score gap analysis, we assume that the marginal

students induced to retake by an intervention would have similar enrollment gains as the average

complier here. Second, we ignore general equilibrium effects that might result from population-

wide increases in retake rates. Such effects might come from colleges raising admission standards

in reaction to higher-scoring applicant pools or from high income and non-URM students increas-

ing their retake rates or numbers of retakes due to increased competition in the admissions pro-

cess. We begin by calculating the impact of equalizing retake rates on income and race gaps among

the SAT-taking population, which requires only the College Board data described previously. We

then bring in one additional data set, the National Center for Education Statistics’ High School

Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS), to estimate the impact on closing gaps among all high school

graduates, the full population among which college enrollment gaps are typically estimated.

      Raising the retake rates of low income students to that of high income students would close

about 18-25 percent of the income gap among SAT takers in four-year college enrollment. To show

this, we again begin with the fact from Table 2 that low income SAT-takers are 20.6 percentage

points less likely than high income SAT-takers to retake. Our estimates in Table 5 imply that the 1.4

retakes induced by round-number thresholds in low income SAT-takers increase their four-year

college enrollment rate by 29.9 percentage points. Inducing 20.6 percent of low income SAT-takers

to retake 1.4 times would thus boost the average four-year college enrollment rate of low income


                                                 23
SAT-takers by six percentage points (0.206 * 29.9). This represents 25 percent of the 24.9 percentage

point enrollment gap between low and high income SAT-takers.31 If the impact of retaking grows

linearly with the number of retakes, then inducing low income SAT-takers to retake once at the

same rate as high income SAT-takers would close the enrollment gap by about 18 percent (25/1.4).

Given that first retakes have larger impacts on SAT scores than subsequent retakes, the true impact

of inducing one additional retake in low income SAT-takers is likely somewhere between these 18

and 25 percent estimates.

       We similarly estimate that equalizing retakes rates by race would close 10-14 percent of the

race gap among SAT-takers in four-year college enrollment. URM SAT-takers are 11.3 percent-

age points less likely to retake than non-URM SAT-takers and the 1.4 retakes induced by round-

number thresholds increase their four-year college enrollment rate by 20.4 percentage points. In-

ducing 11.3 percent of URM SAT-takers to retake 1.4 times would boost the average four-year

college enrollment rate of URM SAT-takers by two percentage points (0.113 * 20.4). This repre-

sents about 14 percent of the 16.3 percentage point enrollment gap between URM and non-URM

SAT-takers. Our best per-retake estimate suggests inducing URM SAT-takers to retake once at the

same rate as non-URM SAT-takers would close the enrollment gap by about 10 percent (14/1.4).

The true impact of inducing one additional retake in URM SAT-takers is likely somewhere be-

tween these 10 and 14 percent estimates.

       To compute how equalizing retakes rates among SAT-takers affect college enrollment gaps

among all high school graduates, we need to supplement our data with information on high school

graduates who do not take a college entrance exam. We use HSLS, which allows us to construct

a nationally representative sample of the high school class of 2012. This in turn provides us with

estimates of the fraction of students (by race and income) who do not take a college entrance exam

at all, as well as the four-year college enrollment rates of such students. HSLS does not distinguish

between students who take the SAT and the ACT, the other major college entrance exam, so we

make the additional assumption that estimates on the impact of SAT retaking would apply to

students retaking the ACT.
  31
       For detailed income and race gaps in four-year college enrollment, see Table A.11.




                                                            24
    The extent to which equalizing retake rates closes college enrollment gaps shrinks by half af-

ter incorporating students who do not take college entrance exams, because we assume efforts to

increase retaking would not affect non-takers. Estimates from HSLS suggest that 58 percent of

low income high school graduates never take the SAT or ACT, compared to 39 percent of their

high income peers. Similarly, 57 percent of URM high school graduates never take college en-

trance exams, compared to 49 percent of their non-URM peers. Incorporating these facts, plus

information from HSLS on the college enrollment rates of these non-takers, implies that equaliz-

ing retake rates by income would shrink the income gap in four-year college enrollment among

all high school graduates by 10 percent. Similarly, equalizing retake rates by race would shrink

the racial gap in four-year college enrollment by seven percent.

    These estimated enrollment gap closures among all high school graduates are roughly half the

size of those estimated within the SAT-taking population. That difference can be explained by two

facts documented in HSLS. First, only about half of high school graduates take a college entrance

exam. Second, race- and income-based college enrollment gaps among those who do not take

college entrance exams are fairly similar to the gaps among exam-takers. As a result, the effect of

equalizing retake rates on gaps as measured among all high school graduates is a nearly evenly

weighted average between the effect on the gap within the exam-taking population and zero, the

effect on the non-taking population of high school graduates.



5   Conclusion

Millions of American students take college entrance exams each year but only half choose to re-

take such exams. We provide the first causal evidence that retaking can substantially improve the

college enrollment outcomes of students, particularly for those who are initially low-scoring or

traditionally underrepresented in higher education. Retaking appears to improve college enroll-

ment by increasing admissions-relevant test scores and likely improving the odds of admission.

Though we cannot identify the precise reason why retake scores tend to be higher than first scores,

our empirical strategy eliminates the possibility that such gains are driven solely by selection into

retaking of students who expect to improve. The specific channel through which retaking im-

                                                 25
proves scores does not affect the conclusion that many students who take the SAT only once would

benefit from taking it at least one more time. That meaningful portions of college enrollment gaps

by income and race could be closed by eliminating disparities in retake rates suggests that efforts

to encourage retaking among disadvantaged populations might be worth pursuing.32

    How might additional retaking be encouraged? Intervening to encourage students to take their

first SAT at an earlier date seems particularly promising. Our data suggest that earlier first takes

are strongly associated with increased retaking rates. Low income and URM students are substan-

tially more likely to first take the SAT in 12th grade rather than in the 11th grade, at which point

they have little opportunity to retake prior to college application deadlines. Encouraging earlier

first takes would give students additional time to assess the strength of their college applications

and retake the SAT if they thought it helpful.

    Intervening to make retakes less costly might also be effective. Our descriptive evidence is

consistent with testing fees discouraging retaking, so that efforts to lower such fees or improve

take-up rates of fee waivers might be fruitful. Many low income students do not use the available

fee waiver. In our data, 43 percent of students with self-reported family income under $30,000

do not use a fee waiver. Retake rates might be improved by making the fee waiver application

process more transparent or by sending automated reminders that retakes are free for those who

used a fee waiver on the first take. Financial barriers cannot, however, fully explain low retaking

rates given that 53 percent of students who use a fee waiver on their first take do not then retake,

even though that second take would be free.

    A lack of clarity about the test-taking and admissions processes suggests that informational

campaigns could boost retaking rates. Evidence from web searches suggest that many students

do not know whether they can retake the SAT or do not understand the potential benefits of

retaking, particularly if colleges’ use of multiple scores in admissions is unclear. Typing “retaking

the SAT is” into Google yields two auto-complete suggestions: “Is retaking the SAT bad?” and “Is

it worth retaking the SAT?”, suggesting that these are two common questions students have about
   32
      An alternative way of equalizing retake rates is to prohibit retaking entirely and limit all students to one SAT
attempt. We do not focus on this alternative because increasing the stakes associated with any college entrance exam
would generate substantial opposition and is thus unlikely to be implemented. It would also likely generate substantial
behavioral changes among test-takers, the effects of which would be hard to predict.

retaking. Typing “retake SAT” into Google Trends shows the top related query is “Can you retake

the SAT?”, implying that some students are unclear about whether retaking is even an option.33

       Much more research could be done on the phenomenon of retaking and the college admissions

processes that incentivize it. We have no evidence on interventions designed to increase retaking

rates and retaking is very rarely the primary focus of research papers.34 We also know little about

how or why colleges choose to admit students on the basis of their entire test score history, their

single highest score on a given take, or their highest combined score across takes. Such institu-

tional decisions bear directly on students’ incentives to retake college entrance exams. Anecdotal

evidence from admissions officers suggests that college rankings publications incentivize colleges

to admit students on the basis of superscores, mechanically raising that component of the rank-

ing. Research to study individual colleges’ incentives to adopt one scheme over another would be

helpful, given that Vigdor and Clotfelter (2003) find the most common choice made by colleges is

also “the costliest, least accurate, and most biased” among all available options.

       Finally, the large retaking benefits we document are partial equilibrium effects comparing cur-

rent retakers to non-retakers. Whether the general equilibrium effects of policies to broadly in-

crease retaking rates resemble these estimates depends in part on whether the supply of college

slots is fixed (Krishna, Lychagin and Robles, 2015). Evidence suggests that the postsecondary sec-

tor is often slow to react to changing demand for college education, in part because public funding

lags such changes (Bound, Lovenheim and Turner, 2010, 2012; Kelly, 2016). If colleges do not ex-

pand enrollment, then retaking changes which students gain admission to and enroll in college

but not how many. If enrollment expands faster than per-pupil funding, such additional enroll-

ment may not translate into degree completion (Bound and Turner, 2007; Deming and Walters,

2017). The net impact of interventions to increase retaking rates depends heavily on the broader

landscape of higher education policy.

Notes: Shown above are instrumental variables estimates at each threshold of the impact of re-
taking on four-year college enrollment. Estimates come from the instrumental variable model
described in Equation 2 but run separately for each threshold. The lowest thresholds (700-900) are
omitted for scaling purposes.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by high school are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 ***
 p<.01). Each column regresses an indicator for retaking the SAT on the variables shown. Low income students
 are those with family incomes below $50,000 and middle income students have family incomes between $50,000
 and $100,000. Underrepresented minority (URM) students are those who identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native
 American. Months to retake represents the number of months between a student’s first SAT take and June of senior
 year. All regressions include cohort fixed effects, as well as indicators for missing income or race, so that high
 income and White students are the reference groups. The sample consists of all SAT-takers from the high school
 classes of 2006-14 who had valid math, reading and writing scores. Each regression uses 13,656,612 observations.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by first SAT score are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05
 *** p<.01). Each coefficient in the first two rows is an estimate of the impact of scoring below a multiple of 100
 on retaking behavior. Each coefficient in the third row is an instrumental variables estimate of the impact of initial
 retaking on the total number of retakes, SAT retaking, where initial retaking is instrumented with an indicator for
 scoring below a multiple of 100. The sample consists of all SAT-takers from the high school classes of 2006-14 who
 had valid math, reading and writing scores and who took their first SAT by November of senior year. Columns 2 and
 3 split the sample into students with first scores nearest to the 700-1500 thresholds and those nearest to the 1600-2300
 thresholds. Columns 4 and 5 split the sample into students with family incomes below $50,000 and above $100,000.
 Columns 6 and 7 split the sample into students who are underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic or Native
 American) and those who are not (White or Asian). The bottom panels show complier and mean characteristics for
 each subgroup.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by first SAT score are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05
 *** p<.01). Each coefficient is an instrumental variables estimate of the impact of SAT retaking, where retaking is
 instrumented with indicators for scoring below a multiple of 100. The sample consists of all SAT-takers from the
 high school classes of 2006-14 who had valid math, reading and writing scores and who took their first SAT by
 November of senior year. Panel B splits the sample into students with first scores nearest to the 700-1500 thresholds
 and those nearest to the 1600-2300 thresholds. Panel C splits the sample into students with family incomes below
 $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel D splits the sample into students who are underrepresented minorities (Black,
 Hispanic or Native American) and those who are not (White or Asian).

      sample consists of all SAT-takers from the high school classes of 2006-14 who took their first SAT by November of senior year and whose first score was
      nearest to a threshold of at most 1500. Panel A splits the sample into students with family incomes below $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel B splits the
      sample into students who are underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic or Native American) and those who are not (White or Asian).

 writing scores and who took their first SAT by November of senior year. Panel B splits the sample into students
 with first scores nearest to the 700-1500 thresholds and those nearest to the 1600-2300 thresholds. Panel C splits
 the sample into students with family incomes below $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel D splits the sample into
 students who are underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic or Native American) and those who are not (White

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by first SAT score are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 ***
 p<.01). Each coefficient is an instrumental variables estimate of the impact of retaking the SAT once, where retaking
 is instrumented with indicators for scoring below a multiple of 100. The sample consists of all SAT-takers from the
 high school classes of 2006-14 who had valid math, reading and writing scores and who took their first SAT by
 November of senior year. Panel B splits the sample into students with first scores nearest to the 700-1500 thresholds
 and those nearest to the 1600-2300 thresholds. Panel C splits the sample into students with family incomes below
 $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel D splits the sample into students who are underrepresented minorities (Black,
 Hispanic or Native American) and those who are not (White or Asian).

      sample consists of all SAT-takers from the high school classes of 2006-14 who took their first SAT by November of senior year and whose first score was
      nearest to a threshold of at least 1600. Panel A splits the sample into students with family incomes below $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel B splits the

 high school classes of 2006-08 who had valid math, reading and writing scores and who took their first SAT by
 November of senior year. Panel B splits the sample into students with first scores nearest to the 700-1500 thresholds
 and those nearest to the 1600-2300 thresholds. Panel C splits the sample into students with family incomes below
 $50,000 and above $100,000. Panel D splits the sample into students who are underrepresented minorities (Black,
 Hispanic or Native American) and those who are not (White or Asian).

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by high school are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 ***
 p<.01). Each column regresses the listed outcome on the demographic group indicators. All regressions include
 cohort fixed effects, as well as indicators for missing income or race, so that high income and non-URM students are
 the reference groups. Below each column is the mean outcome for the reference group in each panel. The sample
 consists of all SAT-takers from the high school classes of 2006-14 who had valid math, reading and writing scores.
 Each regression uses 13,656,612 observations.
