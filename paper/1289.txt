          Exchange Market Intervention Under Alternative Forms
                        of Exogenous Disturbances


                                 ABSTRACT



             This paper analyzes exchange market intervention in a

stochastic model of a small open economy. The distinction is made

between disturbances which are unanticipated and anticipated on the one

hand, and those that are perceived as being transitory or permanent, on

the other. The paper demonstrates how the appropriate form of exchange

market intervention is sensitive to these aspects of the disturbances.

Of particular interest is the case of an unanticipated permanent dis-

turbance, when output may be stabilized perfectly about its friction—

less level by the use of a very simple class of intervention rules.

The optimal rules in other cases are also discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

          With   the   freeing up of exchange rates during the last decade,

interest has turned recently to questions related to exchange rate

management. A particular issue which has been addressed by several

economists is the determination of the optimal exchange rate regime,

through intervention in the foreign exchange market. This literature

has been developed within the context of small stochastic macro models,

which in many respects are extensions of the well known framework

developed by Poole (1970); see, e.g., Boyer (1979), Henderson (1979),

Cox (1980), Roper and Turnovsky (1980), Frenkel and Aizenman (1982),

and Turnovsky (1983). These models derive optimal intervention rules

to stabilize some objective, typically domestic output, on the assump-

tion that the stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy are all

white noise; i.e., the stochastic disturbances are both unanticipated

and transitory. One of the main conclusions to emerge is that the

optimal policy can vary widely and depends critically upon the sources

and relative magnitudes of the various stochastic disturbances.

          In practice, of course, the stochastic disturbances facing an

economy vary not only in origin, but also in nature. While some dis-

turbances are .unanticipated, others are expected; and while some may

be transitory, others may be perceived as being permanent shifts. It

would seem reasonable to expect that the appropriate form of exchange

market intervention will depend upon these characteristics of the dis-

turbances. To investigate this question is the purpose of this paper.

Specifically, we extend the framework employed by Turnovsky (1983) to

determine optimal exchange market intervention rules when the exogenous
                                   —2—


disturbances facing the economy may be of quite general form. In

particular, we draw the distinction between disturbances which are:

(a) perceived as transitory or permanent, on the one hand, and (b)

unanticipated or anticipated, on the other.


2. THE MODEL

          To keep technical details down to a minimum, the simplest model

will be used. Consider a small open economy which consumes and produces

a single traded good. Assume also, that there is a single traded bond,

with the domestic bond market being perfectly integrated with that in

the rest of the world. Thus purchasing power parity (PPP) and uncovered

interest parity (IJIP) are assumed to hold.

          Expressing all variables in deviation form, the model may be

written as


                              Pt =          +                                    Cia)
                                                et


                     m — Pt   =             — a2r + U     l    >
                                                                       2   >   0 (ib)


                         r =       +    e+i —        e                           (lc)



                   m ie + 1J2e+i t              + 13t +                          (id)

               =    -          +
                                   v    -                 >0   ,   n   0         (le)

               =   world   price of the traded good at time t,

                   expressed in logarithms,

          e = current        exchange rate (measured in units of the

                   domestic currency per unit of foreign currency),

                   expressed in logarithms,

               =   domestic nominal money supply, expressed in

                   logarithms,

               =   real   domestic output at time t, expressed in

                   logarithms,

          r = domestic        nominal interest rate at time t,

               =   foreign   nominal interest rate at time t,

          e+5 = expectation             of e for time t+s, held at

                          time t; s = 1, 2, ...,       all   t,

                     =   expectation    of p for time t+s, held at

                          time t; s =   1,   2, ...,   all   t,

               =   disturbance    in demand for domestic nioney,

         v = disturbance          in domestic output supply.


          The first three equations of the model are quite standard.

Given purchasing power parity, the domestic price of a freely traded

commodity equals the price abroad multiplied by the exchange rate.

Equation (la) is just the logarthmic version of this relationship.

Equation (ib) specifies domestic money market equilibrium, with the
                                     —4—


demand for money depending positively upon domestic income and nega-

tively upon the domestic interest rate, and also upon an additive dis-

turbance u.-' The assumption of perfectly capital market integration

is embodied in the interest rate parity condition (ic).

           The remaining two equations are somewhat less standard and

require further comment. Equation (id) specifies a money supply rule.

We assume that all changes in the domestic money supply are brought

about by the accumulation or decumulation of foreign reserves through

intervention in the foreign exchange market, with the central bank's

liabilities created against the purchase of domestic assets remaining

fixed. The underlying notion behind (id) is that the intervention

authority has current information on all the financial variables, e.

    and ui1,   as well as the domestic price level p. Thus we postulate


                                +               +
                      m =           v2r + V3W       4t
Using the PPP condition (la) and the UIP condition (ic), this equation

is equivalent to the form (id). The coefficients         are the policy

parameters and the optimal intervention policy is to choose them so

as to optimize an objective, yet to be specified. Note that the

observability of e and p, together with PPP, implies the observability

of the foreign price level          In contrast to most of the existing

intervention literature which restricts the rule to depend upon only

the current exchange rate, (id) allows it to depend upon observations

of other variables, which are observable with virtually equal frequency

as exchange rates, thereby enabling the intervention authority to base

its decisions on a wider information set.
                                  —5—


          The supply of domestic output is specified by (le). This

relationship postulates the deviation in output from its full employ-

ment level to depend upon the unanticipated component of the current

domestic price of output, a current productivity disturbance and the

previous period's expectation of the current productivity disturbance.

This specification can be derived from the one period wage contract models

of Fischer (1977) and Gray (1976) and is given in the Appendix. Using this

specific framework, y is a function of the labor exponent in the firm's

Cobb—Douglas production function, while n is the supp1r elasticity of

labor. As shown in the derivation, the expectation of the productivity

disturbance enters the supply function through its influence on the wage

contract. Under the commonly made assumption that these disturbances

are independently distributed over time, this expectational term is just

zero. Finally, equation (if) describes the rationality of expectations.

          There are four additive disturbances in the model, two of

domestic origin (u,v) and two of foreign origin (qw). The exist-

ing literature treats these as being purely random variables, which are

independently distributed over time. They are therefore unanticipated

and transitory. In this analysis, we do not restrict them in this way.

All we shall assume is that they be exogenous to the small country under

consideration.


3. SOLUTION OF MODEL

tions of (la)—(le). This is most conveniently done by considering the

to render the system unstable (in the sense of the igenvalue (l—1+c2)/

               lying outside the unit circle) then the stable solution is such

that the expectation of the exchange rate for time i, formed at time 0

is a function of the discounted sum of expectations for all periods into

the future. This is the conventional form of rational expectations

solutions and arises in the case of a perfectly flexible exchange rate

(i.      =   0).   On the other hand, if the degree of intervention is such

as to render the system stable (in the sense that the eigenvalue lies

within theunit circle), then tFie stable solution for expectations is

a backward function of past expectations, where we assume that pre-

dictions formed at time 0 for current or past values are correct.'

convenience and that analogous solutions to (5) hold with respect

           In our analysis below, we shall deal with two important cases.

First, we shall assume that the expectations of the composite variable

    formed at time t say, are uniform throughout all future periods.

Formally, this is described by


                    z+1 =          z     say ,   I   =   1,    2, ...       (8)

and characterizes a situation where the disturbance in z is expected to

be permanent. In this case, the stable solution for exchange rate

expectations (7a) and (7b) both simplify


                                                 t =     1,    2, ...       (9)

The second, is where at time t say, a transitory disturbance in z for

the next period t+l is expected; i.e.,


                             0 ;               = 0   i =      2,   3, ...   (10)

In this case the stable solution for exchange rate expectations

                                   —z*
                    e*
                     t+l,t
                              =        t+l,t     t   —   1,    2, ...       (11)
                                   l.1l+2

          In order to determine the optimal degree of intervention, we

must introduce a criterion function. In the literature, two alternative

criteria are frequently adopted. The first of these is the conventional

one of minimizing the variance of domestic output about its constant

long—run mean. The second, introduced by Barro (1976) and Gray (1976)

is the minimization of the variance of output about its full information

frictionless level. This latter quantity, denoted by y, is defined as

being the level of output that would prevail if wages were fully flexible

and not preset by a contract. In the present model, it is well known that

so that y fluctuates to some degree with the productivity disturbance

embodied in v. While both criteria are of interest, and indeed identical
with respect to all but the supply disturbances, we shall focus on

the latter, which recently has been increasingly adopted in the

literature.—

exchange market intervention as described by the parameters p influences
                                         —10--


the behavior of the economy in two ways. First, it affects how expectations

of future exchange rates respond to expectations about the exogenous
disturbances embodied in z+; secondly, it affects how the current

stochastic disturbances u, v,                 and w impinge on the domestic

economy.


4. OPTIMAL EXCHANGE MARKET INTERVENTION

            Equations (6) and (4) form the basis for our analysis of

optimal exchange market interventIon. The assumptions we have made

are sufficiently general to enable us to analyze intervention policies

under quite arbitrary assumptions regarding the nature of the exogenous

disturbances impinging on the economy. We shall restrict our attention

to distinguishing between disturbances wtich are: (a) unanticipated

or anticipated; (b) perceived as being transitory or permanent. Note

that in making the latter distinction, we can do so only in terms of

the perception at the time they occur. It is quite possible that a

disturbance which when it occurs at time t say is expected to be per-

manent, is in fact reversed during the next period. Initially, it will

have been perceived as being permanent, although in fact it will turn

out to be only transitory.


(a) Unanticipated, Perceived Transitory, Disturbances

           Consider the situation in which all disturbances are independ-

ently distributed over time; they are therefore unanticipated and per-

ceived as being transitory. As noted above, this case has been exten-

sively discussed in the literature and hence our treatment can be brief.



      =
           This case is parameterized by setting

           OJfor   all i.   t. It
                                                                =


                                    therefore follows from (6) that
                                                                      vi      =   0,



                                    e*
                                     t+1, t
                                              =0                         (14)
                                  —11--



with tlie corresponding solution for output being


        =    +   ut + {i++ — ai]vt + (23)w + (a2+u4_i)qt                        (15)



Note that the solution of output is independent of the intervention parameter

      This is because for white noise disturbances e÷i = 0.             It is evi—

dent from (15) that the values of the optimal policy parameters, i.             say,
                                             f
which minimize the variance of output around y can be attained recursively.

First, given u, the optimal values for             and U4 are simply obtained by

setting the coefficients of     and        in (15) to zero, namely.


                                     =                                   (l6a)

                                 =        +
                                              1                          (16b)


It therefore follows that by appropriate intervention in response to

and    it is possible to stabilize domestic output perfectly against all

foreign disturbances. Substituting (16a) and (16b) into (15) and taking
                                                   f                2
expectations, the variance of output about             denoted by o, given the

choice of i3 and the conditionally optimal choice of           is



                        =        +             -                         (17)
                                      [+÷
The remaining problem is to choose         to minimize (17). Carrying out

the differentiation leads to the optimality condition

                                                          2
                                                 (1+n+y) U

and combining (16b) and (18) we find


                                              (l+n+')G2
                                                      U
                        = 1 —             —
                                                                         (19)

                                                                                                                   (20)


which, using the PPP and UIP conditions becomes

                                                     (l+n+y)aj
                     nit =                                     2         pt - CLr                   (21)
                                                         ala         J

                Thus the optimal intervention policy can be conveniently expressed

in terms of responses in the domestic money supply to movements in:

(1) the domestic nominal interest rate; and (ii) the domestic price level.

A one percentage point rise in the former should be met by a a2 percent

reduction in the money supply. A one percent rise in the domestic price

level should be accommodated by a less than one percent rise in the

nominal money supply. The adjustment depends positively upon the variance

of the domestic real disturbance and inversely on the variance of the

domestic monetary disturbance. Substituting for the optimal l into

(18) we find that the optimized variance of output is generally strictly

positive. One is not able to stabilize output perfectly about its

frictionless level, unless either u E 0 or v 0. Further discussion

of the present case is given by Turnovsky (1984).


(b) Unanticipated, Perceived Permanent, Disturbances

                Suppose that the disturbances occurring at time t were previously

(i.e., at time t—l) unanticipated, but having occurred are expected to be

                                                                                    v*         =               =
permanent. This is parameterized by assuming q t—l =                                  t, t—l       z*+.
                                                                                                    t j,t —l
for    all j,           =
                             z,       for all j. It thus follows from (9) that exchange

rate expectations are generated by
                                   —l 3—



                                           = 0                          (22a)




                              t+it
                                     =

The corresponding solution for real output, obtained by substituting

(22a), (22b) into (13a), is


                =
                    t
                    f
                        + i(l+ct2—i1)  v
                                    L+n+1 —
                                                   z
                                                 l_i_2
                                                         +              (23)


          The optimal intervention policy follows immediately upon

inspection of (23). It is simply to set             (1-I-a2), allowing the

remaining parameters 2' i3,   p,     to be set arbitrarily, thereby yield-

ing a very general optimal policy rule


               m = (l+a2)e + 2+l,t +                +                   (24)



Intervening in accordance with this rule ensures that y is stabilized

perfectly at its frictionless level, irrespective of the source of the

stochastic disturbances.

          This is an extremely powerful result and contrasts dramatically

with the more familiar case where disturbances are unanticipated and

transitory. In that situation optimal intervention depends upon a

knowledge of the relative variances of the domestic disturbances and

does not in general succeed in stabilizing income perfectly. For dis-

turbances which are perceived as being permanent, however,           interven-

tion rule, which includes the leaning with the wind component m =        (l+a2)e
will stabilize income perfectly about its frictionless level.

          The key to understanding the economic intuition underlying this

result is the domestic money market. Combining (la), (ib) and (ic) we

If the domestic monetary authorities intervene in accordance with the

rule (24), it is seen from (22a) and (22b) that


                                                 = 0                                   (26a)

Being unanticipated, prior to the disturbance, the exchange rate is not

expected to change. However, since the disturbance having occurred is

expected to be permanent, the exchange rate in the following period is

expected to adjust in response to the disturances in U, v, u and

The adjustment in the domestic interest rate which is the immediate con-

sequence of this is precisely such as to render the excess demand for

nominal money balances independent of the disturbances u,                             and

This can be seen by substituting (26b) and (24) into (25) to yield

It is clear from this equation that whatever values of 2' 113                         , are
chosen, the expected exchange rate, given by the term in parentheses,

simply adjusts appropriately, Cancelling terms, equation (27) reduces to

            The fact that 112 i3, and p4 may be set arbitrarily means

that the optimal intervention rule can be specified in a number of con-

venient ways. Perhaps the most convenient is to set p                    p = p,   =   0,
in which case (24) reduces to the simple leaning with the wind rul'


                                          =
                                              (l+c)e
However, setting 12 = U3        0,   p4 =     (l+a2),   enables it to be expressed

in the form


                                 nit =        (l+c)p
in which case the optimal policy is specified in terms of a more than

proportionate accommodation of the money supply to the domestic price

level. Also, setting       =         =                p4 =   0, the rule can be expressed
                                p3        —(l+c2),
in terms of the domestic interest rate


                                      =

In all cases, the perfect stabilization of domestic output is due to the

appropriate adjustment of the expected exchange rate. Which is the most

convenient form will presumably depend upon the availability and relia-

bility of the necessary information.

            It is worth noting that in some cases, output can be stabilized -

optimally   using yet another rule. Recall (23) and consider the term

in parentheses, which after substituting for z is given by


       _______ +    v r     —

Setting    =

                       and      =
                                        +2        one can eliminate the variance in

output due to         and           However, in general one cannot eliminate com-

pletely the total variance due to domestic disturbances, unless of

                       =
course one sets
                             (l+a2), as discussed above. But if u 0 (02 = 0),
so that the only domestic disturbances are dueto productivity disturbances,

   can be stabilized about y by adopting the rule


                                =    [1 — cL1(l+n)1p. —    a2r                  (29)



This policy is identical to (21), derived in the case of transitory

shocks, when one sets a2 = 0 in the latter.

          The economic rationale for this result follows from a considera-

tion of both the domestic money market and domestic supply function. Sub-

stituting (29) into (25) and simplifying (noting that expectations at

tiem t—l are zero), these two relationships simplify to respectively

                                                   —yt
                                           Pt =


                                            =
                                      yt        YP +

The solution for y is again given by (28). The productivity shock

as it impinges on the domestic supply function, generates fluctuations

in output which exceed those of the frictionless economy. If by inter-

vening in the exchange market, the price level can be made to bear part

of the adjustment, the fluctuations in output can be dampened down to

the appropriate level.

          In the two cases we have thus far considered, we have assumed

that the private sector in its perception as to whether the disturbances

which have occurred are permanent or transitory. Of course in due course
                                     —17—


they may prove to be wrong, but our assumption is that agents can form                a
subjective characterization of them. In fact, of course, they may be

unable to decide whether a disturbance which has occurred represents a

permanent shift or is simply a transitory shock. One way to formalize

this is to assign a probability to these states. In this case the

expected exchange rate formed at time t becomes

where 0 is. the probability of the disturbance being permanent. This

expression is derived by taking an average of (14) and (22b), each weighted

by their respective probabilities 1 —        0,0.       The analysis can be carried

out as before, with (22b) being replaced by (30). However, if 0 <              1,   it

can be shown that in general perfect stabilization of y about y is not
        9/
possible.—


(c) Random Walks

            Section 4(b) has dealt with the case of once—and—for—all dis-

turbances, initially unanticipated, but ex post perceived as being per-

manent. This is closely related to the important case where the disturbances

follow random walks. In this case the relevant random variables appearing

in (14) are generated by


                                             +
                             zt =    Zt1           zt

                             v =     v1 ÷ vt
                                 =
                                     _1 + qt
where the       are independently distributed random variables having zero

means and finite variances. Any      change       in       is unanticipated at time
                                          —18—


t—1, but having occurred, is perceived at time t as being permanent and

becomes part of all future expectations formed at that time. For this

process, the expectations of the exchange rate formed at time t and t—1

are respectively


                              =     _zt               =    _zt_1
                                                                                   (31)
                     t+lt         lLi11-'2                lil1.i2
and substituting (31) into (14a), the solution for output is given by

                                                                     -T
                     f
                         +   y(i+ct2i1)          zt   +    1vt
                                                                                   (32)
                                                          1+n+y   + flq


This is virtually identical to (23), the only difference being that the

disturbance terms z, v, and               are replaced by their changes, n,

     reflecting    the non—stationarity. of the random walk process. The

optimal policy is again given by (25) and the explanation given pre-

viously continues to apply.


(d) Anticipated Disturbances

          Thus far, all disturbances have been assumed to be unanticipated.

Sometimes, however, they may be known in advance and as an example consider




                                                                    vi
the following. Suppose that at time t—1 agents perfectly anticipate all

disturbances for the next period; i.e.,                    =              =
                                                                              v,    z,_1 =   z.
However, although they know the magnitude.s of these shocks for the next

period, they do not know whether they are transitory shocks or permanent

shifts. Suppose that at time t—l, before the disturbances occur, agents

assign a probability e1 to the event that they are permanent, so that
(l.e1) equals the probability that they perceive it as being transitory.

The expected exchange rate for time t formed at time t—l is therefore
                                             —19—



                         e*
                             t,t—l
                                     =
                                             9
                                                 t1         (1—9
                                                          + —      ti   )1
                                                                             t
                                                                                                (33
                                         Ll-2               l1+OL2J
This    equation is simply an average of (9), (11) at t—l weighted by

their respective probabilities. Substituting (33) into (l3a) we find

that the solition for output becomes


                         =
                             yt          22+l,t +                                               (34)



It follows from (34) that if the policy maker sets                               =
                                                                                     a2, then
                                         f
                                                  forall t
                                  YtYt
irrespective      of the private sector's perception of the disturbances at

time t   (after    they have occurred) as reflected in e+i. Thus the

monetary rule


                         =           —                    + J3wt +
                              U1e

where   i1,   ji3, 1t4 are   arbitrary will stabilize output perfectly at its

frictionless level.

              The reason is as follows. If the shocks are perfectly anticipated,

the supply function (le) becomes


                  =      — e,_1+             1iy]vt =            Y(e_e_i)            + y (35)

Thus output will be stabilized at y if and only if                                    =   e.    However,

in general the current exchange rate e is influenced by e+i through

the interest rate in the money market equilibrium relationship. By

adopting an intervention rule with                    =          the monetary authority
                                                           a2,
eliminates the effect of the expected future exchange rate from the

money market condition, reducing it to
                                     —20—


                 —
                     (l+c2_11i)e + (c2+3)wt + (l—ii4)q
                                                                —
                                                                    u=   0        (36)



The effect of setting 1i2 =         means that e,_i is the same whether

the disturbances are initially perceived as being permanent or trans-

itory, so that


            =
                 l_i+2
                         =
                             1+[u        + a1y —
                                                         (a23)w     + (l—4)]         (37)



Combining (36) and (37), the money market equilibrium condition (36)

reduces' further to


                      a1(yty) =                                                   (38)



Obviously (35) and (38) together imply y =               y.   Note that the arbitrari-

ness of the remaining policy parameters means that the policy rule can

be expressed in a variety of ways, the most convenient of which is


                                   m =
                                          cz2r                                    (39)



This enables the monetary authority to monitor the domestic interest rate,

rather than trying to infer exchange rate expectations.

          Alternatively, (34) implies that the perfect stability of out-

put will also prevail if


                              ex         =                                        (40)
                               t+l,t         l—1—u2

In general, the expected exchange rate at time t,              following     the observa-

tion of the disturbances, is given by (cf (30)),


                              e',

where    is the probability, held at time t, of the disturbance at time

t being permanent. Thus from (40) and (41) we see that output will be

stabilized perfectly about y if and only if     =           i.e., if and

only if agents' perception of the duration of the disturbance does not

change between time t—l and t. This holds for any intervention rule,

including no intervention at all. Essentially, if all disturbances are

fully anticipated and the perceived degree of permanence is unchanged,

any response in the exchange rate which may occur as a cotlsequence of

an arbitrarily chosen intervention policy, will be fully anticipated.

Any movements in the domestic price level will hence be perfectly antici-

pated and output will fluctuate about its frictionless level.


5. CONCLUSIONS

          The literature on exchange market intervention has restricted

the stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy to be purely random

white noise. In this paper we have allowed these disturbances to be of

more general form. In particular, we have drawn the distinction between

disturbances which are unanticipated and anticipated on the one hand,

and those that are perceived as being transitory or permanent on the other.

In general, we have seen that the appropriate form of exchange market

intervention (or more generally money supply rule) is sensitive to these

aspects of the disturbances and several interesting conclusions emerge.

          Disturbances which are unanticipated and perceived as being

transitory are the most difficult to stabilize. While the optimal rule

turns out to be quite a simple one, involving only the domestic price

level and interest rate, the coefficients do depend upon knowing the

relative variances of the domestic stochastic disturbances and in general
                                    —22—


it will not succeed in stabilizing output about its frictionless level.

By contrast, if the disturbances are perceived as being permanent, then

income may be stabilized about its frictionless level by adopting any

monetary rule which includes the leaning with the wind component

   =              The rest of the rule can be specified quite arbitrarily,
       (l+a2)e.
enabling it to he expressed in a number of convenient, but equivalent,

ways. Essentially, the arbitrariness of the rule is due to the appropriate

adjustment of the expected exchange rate to each such specification. If

all disturbances are perfectly anticipated one period in advance, but

are unknown as to whether they are to be transitory or permanent, a

simple money supply rule involving the appropriate accomodation to the

domestic interest rate will stabilize output perfectly. If both the

magnitude and the degree of permanence of the disturbances are known, then

any rule——including no intervention—— will provide perfect stability.

Derivation   of Supply Function (le)

             As noted in the text, the supply function is based on the one

period wage contract model. We assume that the wage for time t is

determined at time 5—1, such that given expectations of firms and

workers, the labor market is expected to clear. The expected supply

of labor, expressed in logarithms, at the contract wage is


                           N,_i =   n(W,_i
                                                  —
                                                      PJ)             (A.l)


where


                     is the expected supply of labor formed at time
          N    ti    t—l for time t,


          W         =   contract wage expressed in logarithms determined
                        at time t—l for time t,

               =   price level, expressed in logarithms with P t—l
                   being its forecast formed in the previous
                   period.


Assuming further a production function linking the logarithm of out-

put     to the logarithm of employment Nt by


                                   =
                                        (l_e)N +                      (A.2)

where    is a stochastic disturbance reflecting technological uncertainty

it follows that the expected demand for labor, Nt..i;(based on expected

profit maximization) is determined by the marginal product condition


               ln(l—O) —            + ,t—l = W,_1           ,t—l      (A.3)
                                          -A2-


The contract wage is determined by equating the expected demand and

supply of labor appearing in (A.l) and (A.3), yielding


                             —             + ln(l—e) +           t,t—1
                                                                             (A 4
                   t,t—l          t,t—i       l+ne               l+ne


and depends positively upon the expected productivity disturbance. Short—

run actual employment is assumed to be determined by the short-run mar-

ginal productivity condition for firms after the stochastic variables

   and P are realized,namely


                   ln(l—6) —             +       =               —
                                                                             (A.5)
                                   8Nt

Substituting for            from (A.4) into (A.5) and the resulting expression

for Nt into the production function (A.2) yields the supply function


              (l—0)n(l0)
          =
                                 + {i--J                    +
                                                                 - - {j--]      (A.6)


Letting


                        y        (1—0)/a v

and letting lower case letters measure variables about a nonstochastic

level, leads to


                    =                        +v      —
                                                         l+n+y   v1          (A.7)

'We make the usual assumption that all domestic money is held by domestic
  residents who also hold no foreign money. We therefore abstract from
  the possibility of "currency substitution," an issue which is receiv-
  ing some attention in the international monetary literature.

--'1In addition, the general solutions for e include a term containing
  an arbitrary constant A say. This refles the nonuniqueness of
  rational expectations s6lutions. In the case of (5a), A must be
  set to zero to ensure that the solution is stable. In the case of
  (5b), however, stability considerations alone do not suffice to
  determine A0. This can be determined only by invoking some addi-
  tional restriction. In Turnovsky (1983), the procedure was adopted
  of choosing A so as to minimize the one period variance of the
  exchange rate. This approach, which is a variant of the procedure
  proposed by Taylor (1977), turns out to make the subsequent determin-
  ation of the optimal intervention policy rather complicated. In the
  present analysis we invoke the "minimum state representation" procedure
  proposed recently by McCallum (1983). This involves picking the
  rational expectations solution based on the simplest soltuion and
  means that A0 = 0, quite apart from stability considerations. The
  notion that solutions are based on minimum information is attractive
  in that it embodies the idea that forecasters use scarce information
  efficiently.

-"The case where expectations are backward looking, while consistent
  with rational expectations, is of less economic interest. In the
  cases we discuss, the expectations are always forward looking.

       fact, in this case exchange rate expectations are uniform for
  all future periods. However, since only e÷i appears in the
  model, this is the only expression we need consider.

                                                               = 0
-'For a one period transitory disturbance, we find that e+.
  for i = 2,   3, ...There is also a backward looking solutin, which
  is discarded in favor of the forward looking solution, which is not
  only of greater economic interest, but also for a transitory dis-
  turbance is always finite for all values of     .t2.

 -'See,   e.g., the discussion in the survey by Marston (1983).

      is worth nothing that this result therefore also obtains for the
   more usual restrictive type of intervention rule which utilizes only
   information on the current exchange rate.
