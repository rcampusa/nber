         Labor Compensation and the Structure of Private Pension Plans:

               Evidence for Contractual Versus Spot Labor Markets



                                   ABSTRACT

         Distingiishing "spot" versus "contract" views of the labor market is of
critical importance to a host of economic issues ranging from wage flexibility
over the business cycle to firm financial valuation. The structural features of
U.S. private pension plans permit surprisingly strong inferences concerning the
incentive effects of private pension plan provisions and the contractual nature
of the U.S. labor market. This paper examines the accrual of vested pension
benefits of a nation—wide sample of pension plans. We find strikingly large
discontinuities in the profile by age of the ratio of annual accrued pension
benefits to the standard wage. These discontinuities primarily occur at the
ages of full vesting and early retirement. Representative plans often exhibit
absolute changes in accrual ratios of 20 to 30 percentage points at these ages.
The provisions of many plans imply large negative accruals after the age of
early retirement. Job change typically involves a large loss in pension wealth
as well. Since the average worker's marginal product presumably changes
smoothly as he or she ages, these pension data can only be reconciled with spot
market clearing if age wage profiles within a firm exhibit exactly offsetting
discontinuities at key ages. Casual inspection of firm wage setting behavior
rules out this requirement of spot market clearing. In our view the magnitude,
patterns, and variations in pension accrual ratios are strikingly at odds with
spot market equilibrium. While market clearing in longer term contracts seems
the only equilibrium theory consistent with these findings, it also strains our
credulity to ascribe optimizing behavior to the pension accrual profiles chosen
by a vast array of U.S. businesses. In the process of presenting these profiles
we also consider the following questions concerning U.S. pensions. What are the
incentive effects of private pension plans? What is the cost in pension
benefits of job turnover? How important is vesting? Is there a cost in pension
benefits of foregoing the early retirement option? Do pension stipulations
encourage early retirement? While the considerable heterogeneity of pension
plan provisions permits no simple or single answer to these questions, the data
suggest that pensions can have major incentive effects on job turnover and
retirement. In general pensions represent a very significant factor, and at
certain ages, a dominant factor in employee compensation.

           What are the incentive effects of private pension plans? What is the

cost in pension benefits of job turnover? How important is vesting? Is there a

cost in pension benefits of foregoing the early retirement option? Do pension

stipulations encourage early retirement? By analyzing the stipulations of pen-

sion plans, we are able to develop considerable evidence directed to these

questions. At the same time, the structural features of private pension plans

permit new and potentially strong inferences concerning the contractual nature

of labor market agreements and the role of pensions in assisting such arrange—

me nt s.


           Understanding the contractual arrangements between workers and firms is

important for a host of economic issues ranging from the degree of wage flexibi-

lity over the business cycle to the availability of human capital insurance

within the firm. Discriminating between "spot" and "long—term contract" views

of the labor market is also critical for evaluating numerous questions specific

to private pensions. One such question is whether workers and employers fully

appreciate how complex pension plan provisions alter a firm's total compensation

package. Evidence that labor markets closely accord to the predictions of a

spot market would suggest rather small information problems. Equally productive

workers, in this case, receive identical total annual remuneration regardless of
                                      —2—



their current employer or the specifics of the employer's pension plan.

         A second question involves proper disclosure and valuation of a pension

plan's net financial liabilities. In a spot market setting an employer's net

liability corresponds simply to the accrued value of vested pension benefits.

Additional pension liabilities projected to arise from future employment, in

such a setting, are matched dollar for dollar by future projected revenues asso—

ciated with the w'orker'e continued employment   The excess of projected over

accrued liabilities should not, therefore, affect a firm's valuation and

suggests no case for estimating and disclosing projected pension liabilities.

Under a long—term contract arrangement, on the other hand, revenue from con-

tinued employment need not match the accrual of future pension liabilities, plus

the payment of tenure wages, and the disclosure of projected rather than accrued

liabilities is potentially more relevant for firm financial valuation.

         A third question is the effect of pensions on labor nobility and

hiring practices. In a spot market environment the particular and quite pecu-

liar rates of pension benefit accrual with ae described here would have no

consequences for labor nobility, since offsetting increases or reductions in

direct wage compensation would leave the worker indifferent between staying on

the current job or switching to another job offering an identical amount of

total compensation. A spot market would also entail flexibility in wage

compensation sufficient to permit hiring equally productive old and young, black

and white, male and female workers, despite differences in their accrual of

vested pension benefits reflecting age, race, and sex specific nortality

probabilities. Long—term contractual agreements, in constrast, may leave less

flexibility to accomodate differences in individual circumstances.
                                         —3—



         Given knowledge of a worker's current and previous level of earnings,

and the benefit and retirement provisions of his pension plan, one could, in

principle, directly test the spot market hypothesis by checking whether, in each

year, the sum   of   the increment to a worker's accrued vested pension benefits

plus his wage compensation equalled his marginal product.2 Unfortunately, a

worker's marginal product is unobservable and difficult to estimate. In addi-

tion new government data linking pension plan provisions and the earnings

histories of participating workers have not yet been released.3 These data

limitations restrict, but, by no means, preclude inferences about spot versus

contractual labor market arrangements.

         While little is known about the typical profile of marginal produc-

tivity by age, it seems safe to assume that this schedule does not exhibit sharp

discontinuities. In addition, while there is currently no publicly available

means of matching particular earnings histories with particular pension plans,

there is considerable information available concerning the typical shape of age—

earnings profiles.

         This paper calculates the pattern of accrual of vested pension benefits

for alternative, but realistic, age—earnings profiles. These accrual profiles

are computed for a large sample of plans contained in the Bureau of Labor

Statistic's 1979 Level of Benefits Survey (BLS—LOB). This new pension data,

based on a survey of 1,1469 establishments with 3,386,121 pension participants,

provides extremely detailed information concerning pension benefits, vesting,

and early retirement formulas, all of which are key inputs to the calculation of

pension accruals.
                                      _14—




         The sum of the assumed age—earnings profile, measured in constant

dollars, and the associated real pension accrual profile equals, under the spot

market assumption, the age—marginal productivity profile. Hypothetical age—

marginal productivity profiles derived in this manner exhibit rather sharp

discontinuities at two critical ages, the age of full vesting, for plans with

cliff vesting, and the early retirement age, for plans permitting early retire-

ment on better than actuarially fair terms. For a large fraction of pension

plans making reasonable assumptions concerning age—earnings profiles and

interest rates, we find discontinuities as large as 50 percent of wage compen-

sation depending on the worker's age at hire. An alternative statement of these

findings is that for smoothly shaped age—marginal product schedules, wage com-

pensation must potentially fall or rise by roughly 140 percent of the wage at the

age of cliff vesting and other critical ages to satisfy conditions of spot

market equilibrium. These figures appear sufficiently large to rule out the

hypothesis of spot clearing for a large segment of the U.S. labor market.

         In addition to the potentially large discontinuities in pension benefit

accruals, the pattern of accruals also sheds considerable light on the potential

role of pensions in discouraging worker turnover. In many instances even

workers who change jobs with no loss in wage compensation and commence

enloyment in a new firm with an idential pension plan lose a large amount in

pension benefits.

         The accrual patterns also permit inferences about incentives that pen-

sions provide for early retirement. Under our actuarial assumptions we find

positive pension accruals on average throughout the work span, i.e., worker
                                        —5—




separation   at any time prior to normal retirement typically involves a loss of

remuneration in excess of the loss in wage compensation. These findings appear

to differ from those of Lazear (1983), 'who finds that after the age of early

retirement, continued work typically involves a loss in pension benefits. Part

of the difference in results is due to differences in interest rate and nominal

wage growth assumptions. In addition, we do not consider in this paper benefits

for au   plans covered     the LOB survey.    in particular, all plans used in this
analysis base benefits on wages.
         As Lazear's (1983) insightful study points out, the present expected
value of accrued pension benefits represents a form of severance pay for workers

'who choose to separate from the firm. Such severance pay would naturally arise

in contractual settings in which workers are paid (in wages) less than their

marginal products. The severance pay may be thought of as the return of the

'worker's bond which he puts up to guarantee the quality and quantity of his work

effort. As the worker ages the value of this "severance pay" rises according to

our findings. In a contractual setting the implication of our finding of

positive average pension accrual at all ages prior to normal retirement is that

real wages represent a lower bound for the average marginal product of workers

covered by our sample of plans. It is important to emphasize, however, that we

find large deviations from the average, with large negative accruals after the

age of early retirement under the provisions of many plans.

         Finally, an additional implication of our findings is that compensating

differentia.l studies of the tradeoff between wages and pension benefits, if they

are to be meaningful, cannot be based on cross—section evidence at a point in
                                      —6—



time. To understand the relationship between compensation in the form of wages

versus pension benefits, one must consider the receipt of both over a long

period of employment.

         The next section describes procedures used to calculate pension benefit

accrual and presents illustrative accrual rates for a standard earnings—based

defined benefit plan, but one that is not integrated with social security. This

plan is also used to dexnstratê the sensitivity of accrual rates to assumptions

about wage inflation and interest rates. Section II presents evidence con-

cerning age—earnings profiles, suggesting, in particular, that for fully

employed workers between ages 55 and 65 who remain in a given firm, nominal ear-
nings grow on average at rates commensurate with, if not greater than, infla-

tion. The assumption of positive nominal wage growth after age 55 is crucial

for generating positive pension benefit accrual between 55 and 65. Section III

describes the BLS—LOB data set in xxre detail and examines the heterogeneity of

accrual profiles for our sample of 1183 plans.5 We conclude section III by

drawing inferences from these data concerning the weight of evidence in favor of

contractual as opposed to spot labor markets. Section IV summarizes principal

findings and suggests areas for future research.

I •     Pension     Benefit   Ac crual   Formulae and Illustrative Grap of Accrua]

        Prof lies

        A. Accrual Formulae

        To begin, consider the benefit accrual profiles shown in Figure 1.                   The

nominal wage growth incorporated in the top profile assumes moderate life cycle

growth in real wages plus a 6 percent rate of inflation. A 3 percent real

interest rate (or 9 percent nominal rate) is also assumed. The lower graphs are

based on 6 and 9 percent real (12 and 15 percent nominal) interest rates respec-

tively. In the paragraphs below we describe features of pension benefit

formulae that produce the unusual shapes of these profiles.

        Vested pension benefit accrual at age a, 1(a), equals the difference

between pension wealth at age a +         1,   Pw(a +   1),   and pension wealth at age a,

Pw(a), accumulated to age a + 1 at the nominal interest rate r, i.e.:


(1)      1(a)     Pw(a +   i)   —   Pw(a)(1 +   r)

Pension wealth at age a is defined as the expected value of vested pension bene-

fits discounted to age a. Intuitively, Pw(a) can be thought of as the worker's

pension bank account. If 1(a) equals zero, the worker continuing employment with

the plan sponsor at age a has exactly the same pension wealth at age a + 1 as an

identically situated worker who terminates employment at age a.                Pension accrual

is thus the increment to pension wealth in excess of the return on the pre-

viously accumulated pension bank account.

         If the labor market exhibits spot market equilibrium, 1(a) plus the

worker's non-pension compensation at age a, W(a), equals the worker's marginal

product at age a, M(a):

(2)        M(a) = W(a) +   1(a).

Obviously, if W(a) is a smooth function of age, and 1(a) exhibits sharp discon—

tinuities, M(a) must exhibit sharp discontinuities at these same ages to satisfy

(2)

           The source of discontinuities in age accrual profiles is clarified by

considering a simple earnings—related defined benefit plan with "cliff vesting't

at 10 years of service. Vested accrued benefits are clearly zero prior to the

age at which the worker has ten years of credited service in the plan. Let

R(a,t) denote the ratio of 1(a) to W(a) for a worker age a with t years of

tenure. Then R(a,t) is zero for t <         9,   If a person age a with 9 years of ser-

vice works an additional year, the ratio of the increment to the wage W(a) is


                                                             - (a +   1))

In    (3). B(a,t) is the retirement benefit available to the worker who terminates

employment with the plan sponsor at age a after t years of service, but who

delays receipt of pension benefits until the plan's normal retirement age. The

normal and early retirement ages assumed for this stylized plan are 65 and 55

respectively.     Terminating workers are, however, eligible for early retirement

benefits. Our hypothetical plan reduces benefits by d percent for each year

that early retirement preceeds normal retirement. The benefit reduction rate,

d, could be greater than, equal to, or less than the actuarial fair rate. Today

most plans offering early retirement appear to stipulate smaller than

actuarially fair reduction rates; consequently, the formulae presented here

assume that workers always gain by receiving their vested accrued benefits at
                                                   —9--



 the earliest possible date.

            The function A(55) is the actuarial discount factor that transforms

benefit flows Initiating t age 55 into expected stocks of pension wealth at age

55. Expectations here are taken with respect to longevity. Thus A(55) is the

annuity value of a dollar's worth of pension benefits to be received each year

until death, beginning at age 55. For simplicity assume that the probability of

dying prior to age 55 is zero. Hence the present value at age a of A(55) is
                        — a)
A(a)   A(55)(]. +            for a< 55. If pension benefits are determined as

a constant A times the product of final year's earnings and service, and there

is no offset for receipt of social security benefits, B(a,t) is simply:



(1)         B(a,t) = AW(a)t,           and


                                                                                   W(a + 1)

            R(a,t), for t increasing pari—passus with age, is zero prior to t

produces spikes in the accrual profile such as that in Figure 1 at 10 years of

service. Between the age at cliff vesting and age 55, pension wealth Pw(a) is

given by:

          R(55,t) =    x(i   +   d)0(i +                                               -

            Assuming wage growth at 514           is   close to that at 55 and A(56) approxima-

tely equals A(55), then R(55,t) primarily differs from R(514,t — 1) because the

first terms in the bracket in (7) is now multiplied by (1 +                 d) while the second

term, —1, is multiplied by (1 +            r).      Since r exceeds d by assumption, R(55,t)

can easily be less than R(54,t —            1).        Indeed, this change in the functional form

of R(a,t) can produce sharp drops              in   accrual rates at the early retirement age

 for a host of pension plans and a range of realistic economic assumptions.

Figure 1 illustrates such discontinuities.

            It is important to realize that the early retirement reduction, lower

wages, and one less year of tenure yield lower benefits at 55 than at 56. The

early retirement reduction reduces benefits at the rate d. But if benefits were

taken at 55 they could accrue interest at the rate r. Thus by foregoing the

depends on the difference r — d.       If this loss is not offset by the increase due

to wage growth and 1 year of additional tenure, there will be a drop in the

benefit accrual rate between 55 and 56.

           The same considerations pertain to benefit increments between 6 and

65. Recall that we have assumed a less than fair early retirement reduction so

that benefits accrued before 55 are valued assuming receipt of benefits at the

age that yields maximum pension wealth. The optimum time to receive benefits

accrued between 55 and 56 is 56, between 56 and 57 is 57, and so forth. But to

gain benefits from working another year, it is necessary to forego the option of

immediately taking accrued benefits at an advantageous reduction rate.

           Between ages 56 and 65, R(a,t) equals:




(11) R(a,t) =         + dY6     a)(1 +   r)   A(a)t
                                                                     (t +   1)
                                                                                   A(a(+)1)
                                                                                              (1 +
                                                                                                     d ]
In   contrast to the R(a,t) formula in (7) applying to the period between cliff

vesting and early retirement, (ii) indicates that the actuarial reduction

factor-—rather than the interest rate r—-imparts an upward tilt in the R(a,t)
                                     —12—


profile between early and normal retirement, as long as the term in brackets is

positive. In (11) as in (7) and (io) the accrual rate, R(a,t) is an increasing

function of the rate of nominal wage growth. Larger nominal interest rates

reduce accrual rates at all ages, with a negative interaction with age prior to

early retirement.

         Finally, while equation (T) is unlikely to be negative, wide differen-

ces between wage growth and the interest rate r can yield negative increments in

pension wealth after the early retirement age. To a first approximation, the

bracketed term in equation (ii) will be   positive   if W/W +   l/t r
                                                                  >     — d where


W/W is the percent increase in wages and    lit the percent increase in tenure.
It is easy to see, however, that low wage growth and high interest rates will

yield negative increments. Thus actuarial increments after the early retirement

age are very sensitive to assumed values for wage growth and the interest rate.

         While the preceeding formulae are suggestive of the general shape of

accrual rate profiles, there are few earnings—based plans with features as

simple as the one considered here. In addition to nre complicated rules for

plan participation and vesting that often involve age as well as service

requirements, there are a variety of methods of computing earnings bases,

including career averages, and averages of earnings, possibly highest earnings,

over a specified period or number of years. Reduction rates for early retire—

ment are often a specified function of age, if not length of service. Some

plans allow no further accrual after a given number of years of service.

Roughly thirty percent of defined benefit participants belong to plans that are

integrated with social security. There are two, not necessarily independent,

important forms of "integration." One involves a "step rate" benefit formula

that uses a different value for the percentage of the product of earnings times
                                         —13--




 service for levels of earnings below and levels above specified values. The

 second is referred to as an "offset" formula which reduces pension benefits by

 some fraction of the participant's basic social security benefit. Many of the

offset plans set ceilings on the extent of the offset. A minority of plans, in

particular, those with social security offset formulae, provide supplemental

benefits for early retirees prior to their receipt of social security benefits.

The supplemental benefit formulae can also be fairly involved, incorporating

both the participant's age and service in the calculation. There are also plans

that use one benefit formula to compute early retirement benefits and a dif-

ferent formula to determine normal retirement benefits. In addition to these

earnings—related plans, a significant number of plans covering over forty per-

cent of defined benefit participants calculate benefits independent of the

participant's earnings history.6 These formulae can also be quite complex.

There are other plans that are earnings related, but provide differing flat

benefit amounts based on the participant's earnings bracket. Finally there are

plans that specify minimum and nm.ximum benefit levels.

            Each of these additional features can significantly alter the profile

of accrual rates by age, especially the extent of discontinuities in the pro-

file. Our analysis in section IV of pension plans in the BLS—LOB sample takes

account of a great number of these complexities. Pwo important exceptions in

the current paper are plans with non-earnings related benefit formulae and plans

with supplemental benefit formulae. These plans will be considered in future

research.

          The assumption of constant nominal interest rates implies a quite

different pattern of pension accrual than would occur with variable interest

rates. Changes in long term nominal interest rates produce capital gains and

losses on previously accumulated pension wealth that do not directly affect pen-

sion accrual. However, as indicated in equations (5), CT), (io) arid (ii),

accrual rates are also a direct function of the currently prevailing long—term

interest rates. A time path of varying        interest   rates around a constant mean

would produce a much nxre discontinuous age—pension accrual profile than those

of   Figure 1   and other diagrams in this paper.



     B.    Illustrative Graphs   of Accrual Profiles

          Figure    2 depicts three accrual rate profiles for a worker who begins
participating     at age 30 in a defined benefit plan similar to that described

above. The plan calculates normal retirement benefits as 1 percent of average

earnings over the last 5 years of service times years of service. Benefits are

reduced by 3 percent for each year that early retirement preceeds normal

retirement. Cliff vesting occurs after ten years. The early and normal retire-

ment ages are 55 and 65 respectively.

           Nominal wage growth is determined by two factors, a cross-sectional

profile of "merit" increases by age     and   an assumed econoniy—wide rate of wage

inflation. The merit profile involves approximately a 50 percent growth in real

wages between ages 30 and 50 and very little growth from 50 to 65.           The rate of

wage inflation incorporates both across—the—board increases in labor

productivity and the price level. The three profiles in Figure 2 differ both in

their assumed rate of wage inflation and nominal interest rates. The 2 percent

wage inflation profile discounts pension benefits at a 5 percent nominal rate,

while the 6 and 10 percent wage inflation profiles use 9 and 13 percent nominal

interest rates respectively.

           These assumptions about wage growth and nominal interest rates produce

"vesting   spikes" ranging from   5 to 37 percent of vages at age bO The inter-

mediate wage   and interest rate assumption produces a 114 percent spike at cliff

vesting. All three profiles indicate reductions in the accrual rate of about 8

percentage points at age 56. In order to reconcile these profiles with the dic-

tates of spot market equilibrium one must believe that marginal products rise

abruptly by an additional 5 to 37 percent exactly at age 140 and then fall by an

additional 3 to 31 percent exactly at age 141. In addition, an abrupt decline in

the worker's marginal product of close to 8 percentage points exactly at age 56

that occurs neither prior to nor after age 56 is required for the theory of spot

equilibrium.

           One response to these profiles is that straight wage compensation,

rather than increasing smoothly through time, could adjust to rret the spot

market. Figure 3 suggests the implausibility of this view. Here accrual rate

profiles for workers joining the pension plan at ages 30, 140, and 50 are pre-

sented based on the intermediate wage and interest rate assumptions of Figure 2.

The vesting spikes for the three profiles are 114, 36 and 66 percent of the

corresponding wage at ages 140, 50, and 60. While vesting at these latter ages

is much less conmxn than prior to age 140, Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) report that

over a quarter of current defined benefit pension recipients retired with 20 or

fewer years of service.7

          Figure 3 is constructed under the assumption that the workers of the

same age receive identical wage compensation. Thus the diagram indicates the

potential loss in accrued pension benefits for workers who switch jobs, but

receive the same wage compensation in the new job and are covered '•    the   same

pension plan. We present below a similar diagram, based on a plan like our base

plan, but without the early retirement option. In this case, the loss is

substantially greater.

          Figure 14 highlights the importance of the early retirement benefit

reduction formula for pension accrual. The profile labeled "early retirement

option" repeats the accrual profile from figures 2 and 3 based on intermediate

economic assumptions. The "retirement at 65 only" profile indicates the pattern

of accrual rates for the same plan, but excludes the early retirement option.

This profile could also be labelled "actuarially fair accrual rates" since, by

definition, an actuarially fair early retirement reduction formula produces an

accrual profile that is independent of the age at which benefits are first

received.

            To the extent that retirement benefits provide an incentive to continue

working, the incentive is much greater without the early retirement option than

with   it. It is important to realize that the difference is only a matter of the
pattern of    accruals; for   workers who retire at normal retirement, the total
accumulation    of accrued benefits is independent of whether the plan does or does

not have an early retirement option.

           In contrast to the "early retirement option," the actuarially fair

"retirement at 65 only" profile exhibits a 6 percent rather than a l4 percent

value for R(a,l0) at cliff vesting. In addition there is no discontinuity at age

55 in the latter profile. While these features of the actuarially fair profile

are less troubling for the spot market bypothesis, the very rapid rate of bene-

fit accrual between 55 and 65 presents other difficulties for this view of the

labor   market. The merit schedule   built into the nominal wage profile ipiies a

quite limited growth in   real wages of workers after age 55.   If anything,   this
schedule   appears to provide for too much growth in real wages after 50. As

described in the next section, cross—sectional profiles of earnings 'by age

decline slightly after age 50 for virtually all classification of workers by

occupation and major industry. Since a three percent growth in real wages due

to econoxr-wide productivity growth is above   historic averages, one might    rea-

sonably infer that real wage growth after age 55 is below three percent. The

actuarially fair profile of figure , however, entails increases in total real

pension remuneration of almost twenty percent of real wages between ages 55 and

6. Needless to say, it is difficult to accept the spot market implication

that, in addition to productivity—induced real wage growth, workers at age 65

are twenty percent ire productive than they are at age 55. Thus the plan exa—

mined in Figure 14 indicates that the difficulty in reconciling pension accrual

rates with a spot market is not simply the result of early retirement benefit

provisions.
           Figure 5 and Figure 1 above demonstrate the sensitivity of the accrual

profiles to assumptions about nominal wage growth and nominal interest rates.

Figure 5 repeats Figure   under the assumption of a 10 percent interest rate,

but no growth in wages by age. For the profile with the early retirement option

accrual rates after age 55 are substantially negative, approaching —15 percent

of salary at age 65. With no early retirement option, on the other hand,

accrual rates are always positive. The bottom profile in Figure 1 incorporates

6 percent nominal wage growth, but a 15 percent nominal interest rate. The

intermediate profile in Figure 1 is based on 6 percent wage growth and a 12 per-

cent nominal interest rate. It yields increments at 65 that are approximately

zero. These figures indicate that a considerable gap between nominal interest

rates and wage growth rates is needed to produce negative accrual rates.

         Finally, we illustrate in Figure 6 the cost of job change with no early

retirement option. It should be compared with Figure 3. The plans represented

in the two diagrams are the same except that in Figure 6 the early retirement

reduction schedule is assumed to be actuarially fair (or, that there is no early

retirement option). Again, the top line of this graph shows the accrual rate

under our plan for a person who starts work at age 30 (with 6 percent wage

inflation and a 3 percent real interest rate). A person with one job change

would accumulate benefits up to age I] according to the top curve, but then

would accumulate benefits according to the curve labelled "age hi." Note that

no benefits would.be accumulated for the first ten years. The difference in

accumulated pension benefits at age 65 reflects both the difference in the areas

under the two accrual paths and the interest rate used in accumulation of these

flows. This difference could be very substantial, and depends, of course, both

on when job changes occur and how freciuently they occur. It is important to

note that the loss in accrued benefits from job change in this example is not

due solely to vesting; in figure 6 accrual, in years after vesting occurs, is

larger for a worker remaining on the same job for 35 years than for a worker who

changes jobs (literally pension plans)        This lower accrual beyond vesting for

later plan entrants results from the interaction of tenure and wage growth in

earnings based defined benefit pension formulae. To see the nature of this

interaction consider a plan with immediate vesting that pays 2 percent of I irial

year's salary times years of service. For a worker experiencing positive wage

growth    who is employed for say 30   years and retires at 60 the pension benefit is

2   percent of the age 60   salary   times 30. If this same worker experiencing the
same wage growth were to change jobs each year joining an identical plan his
benefit would equal 2 percent times the sum of the 30 annual salaries.

Assuming positive wage growth, the pension benefit of the former worker which is

based on the age 60 salary will exceed that of the latter worker whose benefit

is primarily based on the lower earnings received in earlier years of his

career.

 11.     Wage Rate Profiles


            To calculate average pension benefit increments by industry—occupation

 group, for a given length of employment, we need estimates of age—wage profiles

 for   each group. It is particularly important that assmnptions about the wage
profiles of older workers be as realistic as possible. Without lengthy longitu-
dinal records on individuals, we have no completely satisfactory way of esti-
mating age—wage profiles. The Retirement History Survey (RHs), however, does

provide some longitudinal data for older workers.8 We first discuss evidence

from these data, and then present estimated age-wage profiles based on the

Current Population Survey (cPs) data. For older workers the two sources of data

seem to provide roughly consistent evidence.

            The age—wage profiles appropriate for determining pension accrual are

clearly those pertaining to workers staying in the same firm, thus tenure as

well as age should be included in the analysis of earnings by age. Our accrual

profiles also assume full—time employment. Hence, wage rates per unit of time

is the appropriate earnings concept for our purposes. While conventionally com-

puted age—earnings profiles sometimes show a downward trend for older workers,

this appears due, in part, to a reduction in hours worked, and, in part, to the

mix of ftll time and part—time workers in the sample.



A.     Evidence From the Retirement History Survey
           The RHS data is based on a sample of persons who were first surveyed in

1969 when they were between 58 and 63. These respondents were resurveyed every

two years until 19T9. Table 1 shows the means of hourly wages by age and year

little decline in wage rates at least through age 63 or 613. The number of

observations per cell is fairly small since the cells only include older indivi-

duals who are still working. Possibly those whose wage rates would have fallen

from one year to the next are less likely to be in the sample. Analogous calcu-

lations showing the median of annual salaries of persons who reported weekly,

monthly, or annual salaries, are presented in Table 2. Here again, in the cross

section, there are relatively constant real salary levels through age 613 among

persons who are not retired, although there seems to be some decline on average.

          The accrual calculations require, however, nominal wage profiles. From

both tables 1 and 2, it is clear that nominal wages of older workers increased

rather rapidly over this period. A more precise indication of nominal increases

is shown in Table 3 for all persons who reported weekly, monthly, or annual

salaries. The entry corresponding to age 58—60 and the year 1969—Ti is the

median salary increase between 1969 and 19T1 over all persons who were 58 in

1969 and who reported salary figures in both 1969 and 19T1. The other entries

are calculated in an analogous manner. The table shows very substantial nominal

increases over this period, on the order of 6 percent per year on average. (The

entries pertain to a two year interval.) Considering the average increments by

age in the last column, there is some evidence that the increases declined

somewhat with age. At least through 19T7—-after which our sample sizes are very

small——it appears that salary increases for these older workers were in general

keeping up with price increases. The percent increases in the Consumer Price

Index (cPi) for the years 1969 to 1977 were as follows:

In   short, these data suggest substantial nominal wage increases for older

workers, roughly consistent, on average, with overall inflation levels.



B. Wage—Tenure Profiles from the Current Population Survey

          To estimate age tenure profiles by industry and occupation group, we

matched the May 1979 Supplement to the CPS March 1979 CPS. The May Supplement

provides tenure data, while the wage data come from the March tape. We were

able to obtain the reciuired wage, age, and tenure information for somewhat over

15,000 persons in the 21t industry—occupation groups distinguished in the LOB

survey. Relevant cell sample sizes, however, were large enough to obtain

"reasonable" estimates for only 16 groups, noted below.

          After considerable experimentation with two-way tables showing average

salary by age and tenure, we elected simply to obtain least-squares estimates of

wage rates using the specification


(12)      W =        +         +          +         +          + cAT
                a0       a1A       a2A2       b1T       b2T2

where W is the wage rate, A is age, and T is tenure. To estimate wage levels by

age for a person who entered a firm at, for example, age 30 we calculRted

                                      +   (A    )(A — 30)


for values of A between 30 and 65.

           The estimated profiles for the total group, and by occupation over all

industry groups, are presented in Figure 7. These profiles are empirical coun—

terparts   of the "merit" scale used in the illustrative calculations in section I
above.
           The cross—sectional age earnings profile (13) for all groups combined

increases by about 50 percent between age 30 and age 52 when it reaches its

maximum. Then it declines by about 10 percent over the next 13 years, or about

.8   percent   per year on average. Assuming a wage inflation rate of 6 percent

therefore, produces a nominal wage rate for older workers increasing at about 5

percent per year. For older workers this path of nominal wage growth seems to

be in rough accord with the evidence from the Retirtxnent History Survey.

           In addition to the graphs of the cross—section wage profiles, summary

indicators of their shapes are provided in Table 4. It shows salary at age 30,

maximum salary, the age of maximum salary, and salary at age 65,             together   with

average percent increases between the end points and the maximum.

III.        Accrual Rates from the BLS Level of Benefits Survey


            The BLS—LOB (1979) establishments constitute a subsample of the 1979

National Survey of Professional, Administrative, Technical and Clerical Pay.

Based on the file's population weights this subsample covers 17,965,282 private

pension plan participants in the U.S., which is slightly over half of all par-

ticipants covered by private pensions. The subsample's universe consisted of

all    firms with   over 100 employees with the exception of mining, construction and

retail    trade   establishments where the minimum firm size was 250 employees and

service establishments where the minimum firm size was 50 employees. Sampled

establishments were requested to report work schedules and information about 11

different types of fringe benefits. This information was provided for each of

the three occupational groups. The BLS—LOB (1979) pension benefits tape con-

sists of establishment records for each occupational group that detail features

ofpension benefit plans covering the particular occupational group in question.
Unfortunately firm identifiers are intentionally excluded from the computer
record;   hence, it    is   impossible to reconstruct the actual pension charac-
teristics of the initial establishment. The data can, however, be used to esti—

mate industry—wide or occupation—wide values of pension variables.

           In this section we examine accrual ratios for 1183 earnings based

defined benefit plans. Earnings based plans account for approximately 80

percent of BLS—designated usable plans from the survey and about 65 percent of

plans weighted by pension coverage.9 Each of the 1183 plans stipulates

cliff—vesting at 10 years, but the plans have different normal and early

retirement ages. Other earnings based plans with different vesting ages have
                                             —25—



accrual profiles similar to those that we shall describe, but for convenience of

exposition we have not included them in our analysis here. Of the 1183 plans,

508 are integrated with social security under an offset formula.

          Table 5 presents weighted average accrual ratios for the 1183 plans by

early and normal retirement ages for workers hired at age 31. Our intermediate

assumptions of 6 percent nominal wage growth and a 9 percent interest rate are

used in conjunction with the industry—occupation—age-earnings profiles discussed

in section II. The spike at the age of vesting varies with early retirement and

normal retirement ages. It is 21 percent for plans with early and normal

retirement at 55. Among the plans with early retirement at 55 the vesting spike

declines with the age of normal retirement, with a vesting spike of

approximately 12 percent for plans with normal retirement at 60 and a spike of

about 7 percent for plans with normal retirement at 65. For plans with later

early and normal retirement ages, the vesting spike is much smaller, ranging

from a little over 3 percent to about 5 percent.

          A   total of 356   plans   have the same early and   normal retirement ages,

i.e.,   they do not permit early retirement. For       example, there are 209   plans
with both early and    normal retirement at age 55. In     this case, the accrual
ratio   immediately after vesting is about 5 percent and increases to about 15

percent by age 50. Between ages 50 and 55 the accrual ratio increases to almost

27 percent. A similar pattern is observed for the other plans in which the

normal and early retirement ages are the same, but the accrual ratios just after

vesting are no riore than 1 percent in these cases. It may be noted that these

plans correspond to our earlier description of plans with no early retirement

              10—year cliff vesting, by early and normal retirement age.a

provision, as depicted for example in figure 14 We have not calculated accrual

ratios after the age of normal retirement, but it appears that in most cases

accrual after the normal retirement age is very small and in some cases

significantly negative. Hence, there appears to be a very substantial

discontinuous drop in the rate of pension accrual after the normal retirement

age for a significant fraction of private pension plans. In subsequent work we

shall describe in detail the accrual rates of plans after the age of normal

retirement.

         Plans with early retirement typically exhibit a rather slow increase in

accrual ratios after vesting until a few years before the age of early

retirement. There is often a sharp drop in the accrual ratio at that age, with

either limited increases or gradual declines in accrual ratios thereafter. For

example, of the 528 plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at

6 the accrual ratio reaches about 10 percent at age 55 and then drops by about

30 percent to '(   percent at age 6. By age 65   the accrual ratio has fallen to 5

percent. The pattern exhibited by these plans is similar to the one described

in figure 14 for a typical plan with a normal retirement provision.

         A comparison of plans with and without a social security offset is

presented in table 6, for plans with early retirement at 55 and normal

retirement at 55, 62, or 65. There are two major differences in these plans:

first, the within group weighted average spike at vesting is very substantial

for plans without social security offset, ranging from 12 to 26 percent and is

very small for plans with a social security offset with the exception of plans

with normal retirement at age 55. In this case the average spike at vesting is

about 8 percent. Second, the discontinuity in accrual ratios at the age of

early retirement is much larger for plans without a social security offset than

for plans with an offset. For example, among plans with normal retirement at

age 62, there is a 55 percent drop in the accrual ratio between ages 55 and 6,

while for plans with a social security offset the drop is about 17 percent.

experience faster wage growth prior to their mid—fifties, their social security
Primary Insurance .Amount, a key determinant of the benefit offset, grows at a

faster rate for younger workers. This factor plus the ceilings on the offset

amount established by many of these plans means that social security offsets

reduce accrual ratios prior to a worker's mid—fifties by a greater percentage

than after his/her mid—fifties. •As a consequence, the reduction in the accrual

ratio at age 55 is proportionally smaller in offset plans than in non—offset

plans.

                To demonstrate the wide variation among plans with the same early and

normal retirement ages, we have reproduced in table 7 the accrual ratios for

plans with normal retirement at 55 and early retirement at 6, together with the

minimum and maximum accruals among these plans for each age. Almost half of the

plans have these early and normal retirement ages. The average accrual ratios,

as noted above, rise to about 10 percent by the age of early retirement and then

fall to about 5 percent by the age of normal retirement at 65. But there is a

very large variation among the plans. In particular, a large number of plans

exhibit negative rates of pension accrual     after   the age of early retirement,

while others   have much higher accrual ratios than the average. For example, at
65 the accrual ratios range from a low of a negative 33 percent        to   a high of

about 35 percent.      These differences highlight the potential importance of joint
consideration of wage rates and pension accruals, a task that we shall pursue in

the future if appropriate data can be obtained.

           Table 8 shows how average accrual ratios vary across industries. An

important    difference among the five industry groups is the proportion with
specific early and norma.l retirement    ages. Approximately 60     percent   of plans in

manufacturing have early retirement at 55 and     normal retirement at 6,       while   in
retail   trade re than 90 percent are in this group. Over 60 percent of plans

in manufacturing on the other hand have early retirement as well as normal

retirement    at 55. Very few    plans in retail trade, finance, or services have

normal   retirement at 55.
           Plans   with early and normal retirement at 55   have   approximately the
same weighted   average accrual patterns in each of the industry groups, with a

spike   at vesting close to 25    percent and the accrual ratio at 55 ranging between
20   and 27 percent. The typical plan with normal retirement at age 62 exhibits a
substantial drop in the accrual ratio     at the early retirement age of      55.   The

drop    is about 35 percent in manufacturing and in finance and over 50 percent in

transportation.

           Plans with normal retirement at 65 typically     exhibit   an accrual pattern

that is much flatter than the pattern exhibited by the other plans in each

industry. These plans exhibit a drop in the accrual ratio at the age of early

retirement that ranges from a low of 114 percent in services to a high of 35

percent in retail trade. The average accrual rate at 65 is minus 6 percent in

retail trade and plus 11 percent in finance. It is approximately 6 percent in

services and transportation and T percent in manufacturing.

         Early and normal retirement supplements lead to widely varying accrual

patterns and we have not tried to summarize them here. We will, however,

present details of these plans in a subsequent paper. We shall also describe in

future work the accrual pattern of flat rate plans with benefits based only on

years of service. Approximately 35 percent of the BLS—LOB pension plans

weighted 1r coverage are of this type. They typically exhibit negative accrual

ratios after the age of early retirement.



B. Accrual Profiles and Job Change

         Job change can reduce pension benefits substantially. For 7149 plans we

calculated accrued benefits at age 65 for persons hired at 31, 41, and 51. In

these calculations, we assume that a person does not become vested in another

plan prior to joining the firm. For each plan we calculate accrued benefits

using the associated industry—occupation wage profiles, for each of the hiring

ages. The comparison of benefits of persons hired at 31 with those hired at 41

and 51 is made in two ways. The first is to sum age 65 accrued benefits over

all plans for each age of hire and calculate the ratio of the sum of the

benefits if persons were hired at 41 (or 51) to the sum if the same persons
                                        —30--




were hired at 31. The second comparison is the average of the ratios calculated
for each plan, with each ratio weighted by the number of persons covered by the

plan.   The results are shown in Table 9.

          The   aggregate benefits of persons hired at 51 are only about 50 percent
of   the benefits of those hired at 31. Persons hired at 41 would accumulate

about 80 percent of the benefits of persons hired at 31. There is little

difference between plans with and without a social security offset, based on the

weighted average of plan ratios. Variation among occupations is not striking,

but there is substantial variation across industries. Benefits if hired at 51

range from only 31 percent of the benefits if hired at 31 in retail trade, to 8

percent in nnufacturing. The ratio if hired at 141 ranges from 65 percent in

retail trade to 95 percent in transportation.

          Thus job change can impose a very large cost in pension benefits.

While these calculations do not incorporate vesting on one job before changing

to another, we believe that such calculations —— more in line with the

illustrations in section I —— would not substantially alter the order of

magnitude of the benefit losses. Because we used accrued benefits at age 65,

the calculations also incorporate some negative accruals after the age of early

retirement. It may be more appropriate to use maximum accrued benefits for each

age of hire.

IV. Concluding Connuents


         In our view the magnitude, patterns, and variations in pension accrual

ratios are strikingly at odds with the view of spot clearing In labor markets.

While market clearing in longer term contracts seems the only equililbrium

theory consistent with these findings, it strains our credulity to ascribe opti—

mizing behavior to the choice of pension accrual profiles. It seems much more

likely that employees and employers rough tune rather than fine tune in their

choice of pension plans, if there is any tuning whatsoever.

         In our future research we intend to examine the ratio of accrued vested

benefits to straight wages after the age of normal retirement. Preliminary

evidence suggests very sizeable potential work disincentives after the normal

retirement age because of a sharp decline in pension benefit accrual. We will

also focus on the particular plan features having the greatest effect on accrual

profiles. Plans with non—earnings related benefit formulas as well as plans

with early and normal retirement supplemental benefits will also be studied.

Given the appropriate data, we wish to investigate the relationship between

individual earnings profiles and associated pension plans. In particular, we

would like to know the extent to which wages adjust in accordance with pension

plan provisions. A second important issue is the extent to which pension

accrual patterns affect retirement decisions as well as turnover prior to

vesting, early retirement, and normal retirement.
