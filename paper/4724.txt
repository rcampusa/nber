       This paper compares the market value of highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) to the

discounted value of their corresponding cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are provided by

management to investors and shareholders in 51 HLTs completed between 1983 and 1989. Our

estimates of discounted cash flows are within 10%, on average, of the market values of the

completed transactions. Our estimates perform at least as well as valuation methods using

comparable companies and transactions. We also invert our analysis and estimate the risk

premium implied by transaction values and forecast cash flows, and the relation of the implied

risk premium to firm-level betas, industry-level betas, firm size, and firm book-to-market ratios.

1.        Introduction
          This paper compares the market value of management buyouts and leveraged
recapitalizations to the discounted value of their corresponding cash flow forecasts.
Most economists readily accept the concept of estimating market values by calculating
the discounted value of the relevant cash flows. However, there is little preexisting
empirical evidence that shows that discounted cash flows provide a reliable estimate of
market value. This study provides evidence of a strong relation between the market
value of the highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) in our sample and the discounted
value of their corresponding cash flow forecasts.
          Our tests compare the transaction values in HLTs to estimates of the present
value of the relevant cash flows. We use a sample of management buyouts and
leveraged recapitalizations because these transactions typically release the cash flow
information and transaction value required for the analysis. We use the cash flow
forecasts to estimate the cash flows that will accrue to all capital providers, including
different classes of debt and equity. We estimate a terminal value when the cash flow
information ends. We value the capital cash flows using a discount rate based on the
CAPM. We use three CAPM-based approaches to estimate discount rates corresponding
to firm-level, industry-level, and market-level measures of risk. Each of these
approaches works well: the median estimates of discounted cash flows are within 10%
of the HLT transaction values.
         We compare the performance of our discounted cash flow estimates to that of
estimates obtained from alternative valuation approaches that rely on companies in
similar industries and companies involved in similar transactions. Such alternative
valuation approaches — known as comparable approaches —         are   commonly used in
practice. The discounted cash flow (DCF) methods, individually, perform at least as
well a. the comparable methods. We also find, however, that using the DCF and
comparable methods together explains significantly more variation in transaction values
than either method alone.
         Overall, our DCF valuations generally parallel the basic techniques taught in
most business schools. The fact that our resulting values are approximately equal to the
transaction values suggests that the basic approach to valuation is both useful and
reliable. We stress that our valuations rely on several ad hoc assumptions that readers
(both academics and practitioners) should be able to improve on in a specific valuation.
We would expect such improved assumptions to bring DCF valuations closer to
transaction values.
          We also invert our analysis to calculate an implied discount rate or internal
cost of capital — the discount rate that equates the discounted cash flow forecasts to the
transaction value. The median implied risk premium is 7.55% which is comparable to
the historic arithmetic average risk premium. We also examine the relation of the
implied risk premiums to firm size, firm book-to-market ratios, and systematic risk
measures to determine if our results are consistent with Fama and French (1992) who
find that firm equity returns are unrelated to firm-level measures of systematic risk
when firm size and book-to-market ratios are taken into consideration. We fmd that the
implied risk premiums are not significantly related to firm size nor to the pre-transaction
book-to-market ratio. The implied risk premiums are positively related to firm and
industry betas. For this sample, therefore, we favor CAPM-based approaches to
discount rates over those based on size or book-to-market ratios.
          The success of the discounted cash flow valuations is impressive because
HLTs pose additional complications beyond the general concerns about capital market
imperfections and intertemporal asset pricing models that arise in any valuation
problem. First, the cash flow forecasts we rely on come from published legal filings
and may not be constructed to be estimates of expected cash flows. Second, even if the
cash flow forecasts are intended to be expected cash flows, the forecasting process is
likely to involve substantial errors because major changes in organizational form and
asset deployment accompany the HLTs. Third, since these firms have extremely
leveraged capital structures, they may be limited in their access to capital markets and
in their ability to use interest tax shields. Finally, the securities of these firms —
particularly high yield debt and private equity — are likely to be substantially less liquid
than the liabilities of most large public corporations. Greater attention to these


                                             2
complications would presumably lead to better DCF valuations.
              The success of the DCF valuation approaches in spite of the leveraged capital
structures and overall complexity of the HLTs raises concerns that there is something
special about our sample of HLTs. The primary concern is that the cash flows might
somehow be endogenous, and that endogeneity causes the DCF valuations to be
spurious estimates of transaction value. One potential source of endogeneity is that
deahnakers and managers in the HLTs may have had incentives to adjust the cash flow
forecasts. For example, incentives to bias the cash flow forecasts upward are present
when the true expected cash flows are below the level required to obtain transaction
fmancing. Incentive to bias the forecasts downward are present when the true expected
cash flows are substantially above those needed to obtain financing. Because the SEC
and courts effectively require the board of directors of the HLT company to obtain an
opinion from an investment bank that the transaction price is "fair," insiders and
dealmakers may have an incentive to reduce their reported cash flow forecasts to justify
the transaction price.
              We conduct several tests to gauge the magnitude of such adjustments. We
examine the ex post accuracy of the cash flow forecasts and find little evidence of ex
ante bias. We divide our sample into subsamples based on leverage and outside
competition, and also find little difference across the subsamples. Finally, we use our
DCF valuation technique to value initial public offerings where the leverage and
incentives to adjust cash flow forecasts are different from those in our HLT sample.
We find that the DCF valuations provide reliable estimates of value for the sample of
initial public offerings. Overall, we find little evidence to suggest that the reliability of
our DCF approaches is restricted to HLTs.
              The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains our basic valuation
approach in more detail. Section 3 describes the data set along with some sample
statistics.     Section 4 presents the valuation results and compares those results to
transaction values. Section 5 calculates implied risk premiums and compares them to
firm betas, industiy betas, firm size, and firm book-to-market ratios. Section 6 discusses


                                              3
and addresses potential criticisms of our results based on the incentives to adjust cash
flow forecasts. Section 7 summarizes the results and presents our conclusions.


2.         Valuation Techniques
           2.1      Transaction Value
           In our analyses, we compare estimates of value to the transaction value. We
defme the transaction value as: (I) the market value of the firm common stock; (2) pIus
the market value of firm preferred stock; plus (3) the value of the firm debt; plus (4)
transaction fees; less (5) firm cash balances and marketable securities. All of these are
measured at the closing of the transaction. We value debt not repaid as part of the
transaction at book value. Debt that is repaid is valued at the repayment value. Our
measure of transaction value assumes that net working capital (excluding cash balances)
and long-term assets are used to generate the cash flows of the firm.'


           2.2       The Compressed Adjusted Present Value Technique
           The Compressed Adjusted Present Value Technique (Compressed AP\') that
 we use values firms by discounting capital cash flows at the discount rate for an all-
 equity firm.2 Capital cash flows equal the after-corporate-tax cash flows to both debt
 and equity holders of the firm. Because the cash flows are measured after corporate tax,
 the tax benefits of deductible interest payments are included in the cash flows. The
 interest tax shields reduce income taxes, and, thereby, raise after-corporate-tax cash
 flows. Our use of the Compressed APV method is equivalent to using the adjusted



       The sum of the market value of debt, preferred, and equity represents a claim on
 the value of a firm's future cash flows and the firm's current excess cash. We subtract
 cash balances and marketable securities as our estimate of excess cash, because our
 DCF estimates value future cash flows only. We obtain similar results when, instead,
 we subtract excess cash used to finance the transaction.

      2
          We would like to thank Stewart Myers for suggesting "Compressed APV" as a
 label for this method.

present value (APV) method and discounting interest tax shields at the discount rate for
an all-equity firm. This implicitly assumes that the interest tax shields have the same
systematic risk as the firm's underlying cash flows. An alternative way to interpret the
Compressed APV method is that of discounting the capital cash flows at the before-tax
discount rate that is appropriate for the riskiness of the cash flows.
          The Compressed APV method simplifies the valuation of 1-ILTs. The widely
used after-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach is appreciably more
difficult to implement. The WACC approach requires that the cost of capital be
recomputed each period to include the effect of changing leverage over time. It also
requires additional assumptions about the firm's tax status to generate cash flows
assuming an all-equity capitalization.3 The Compressed APV also has a computational
advantage over the standard APV approach, because the standard APV approach
requires that the all-equity cash flows and the interest tax shields be discounted
separately at different discount rates.


          2.2.1     Measuring Capital Cash Flows
          We measure capital cash flows in two ways, depending on the presentation of
the cash flow forecasts for the HLTs in our sample. The first method begins with net
income. We add adjustments for the differences between accounting information and
cash flows. These adjustments include depreciation, amortization, changes in deferred
taxes, changes in net working capital, and interest We add (before-tax) interest
payments, subtract capital expenditures, and add the after-tax proceeds from asset sales.




      See Ruback (1989) for additional background on the Compressed APV technique
and its relation to the weighted average cost of capital approach.

                                           5
(1)          Net Income
           + Depreciation
           + Amortization
           + Change in deferred taxes
           - Change in net working capital
           + interest (cash and non-cash)
           - Capital   expenditures
           + After-tax asset sales
           = Capital Cash Flows

            Our second method for measuring capital cash flows begins with earning
before interest and taxes (EBIT). We deduct corporate taxes which we estimate as the
difference between EBIT and interest expense times the marginal tax rate. Information
on the marginal corporate tax rate is provided in 33 of the IILTs in our sample. For the
remaining 18, we calculate marginal corporate tax rates using the federal marginal tax
rates expected to be in effect at the time of the transaction and a state tax rate of 5%•4
This calculation of taxes assumes that the HLT makes full use of interest tax shields.
We also make the adjustments for differences between accounting information and cash
flows, subtract capital expenditures and add alter-tax proceeds from asset sales:
(2)          EB1T
            - Corporate Tax [= (EBIT - interest) x tax rate I
            + Depreciation
            + Amortization
            + Change in deferred taxes
            - Change in net working capital
            - Capital expenditures
            + After-tax asset sales
            = Capital Cash Flows

            In our analysis, we prefer to use the first, net-income-based capital cash flow
measure over the EBfl'-based measure. The net-income-based measure utilizes
estimates of future tax payments made by the HLT firm while the EBIT-based measure



      '   For transactions completed before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), we
assume a federal tax rate of 46%. For transactions completed after the TRA, we assume
federal tax rates of 46% in 1986, 38% in 1987, and 34% thereafter.

                                             6
relies on our estimates of future tax payments. We use the EBIT-based method in the
15 HLTs in which information on projected taxes and net income is not available.


          2.2.2     Terminal Values
          We calculate terminal values as growing perpetuities by assuming that the
capital cash flow in the last year of the forecasts will grow at a constant nominal rate
in perpetuity. The growth rates should reflect both expected inflation growth and any
real growth implicit in the cash flows.
          Only 11 of 51 sample transactions explicitly note an expected inflation rate.
The average expected inflation rate is 5%. Actual inflation (as measured by growth of
the GNP deflator) averaged 3.4% per year between 1983 and 1989. In 1988, the year
almost 50% of our transactions were priced, the GNP deflator increased by 3.3%. We
present our results using a nominal growth rate of 4%, which corresponds to a real
growth rate between 0% and 1%. Although we feel the 4% rate is economically most
appropriate, we also report the sensitivity of our results to different terminal cash flow
growth rates.
          On average, depreciation and amortization exceed capital expenditures in the
capital cash flow used to calculate the terminal value. This is not a reasonable
assumption. With 4% nominal growth in perpetuity, we expect capital expenditures to
be slightly greater than depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, we adjust the
capital cash flow of the terminal value in two different ways to correct this
inconsistency: first, we set depreciation and amortization equal to capital expenditures;
and second, we set capital expenditures equal to depreciation and amortization. We
report the results using the first method, which we view as economically more
appropriate.5




     We obtain qualitatively similar results both when we use the second method and
when we make no adjustment.

                                           7
          2.2.3     DLscount Rates
          We discount the capital cash flows using the expected return implied by the
Capital Asset Pricing Model for the unlevered asset:
          (3) r               =         rf +     3"x[rm-rf]
where rr is the risk free rate, f3U is the firm's unlevered beta or systematic risk, and rm -

r is the risk premium required by investors to invest in a firm or project with the same
level of systematic risk as the stock market.
          We use the unlevered cost of capital because it is a reasonable estimate of the
riskiness of the firm's assets. Our cash flow measure includes all of the cash flows
generated by the assets, including interest tax shields. Under the assumption that the
riskiness of these cash flows is the same as that of the firm's assets, the unlevered cost
of capital is the appropriate discount rate using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The
unlevered cost of capital can also be interpreted as the before-corporate-tax, weighted
average cost of capital. The before-tax discount rate is appropriate to discount capital
cash flows because the tax benefits of interest are included in our cash flow measure.
By adjusting the cash flows for taxes and applying Modigliani and Miller (1963), we
can assume the weighted average cost of capital is the same for different levels of
leverage and we do not have to estimate the cost of debt.
          We present valuations using three different measures of systematic risk. First,
we use a firm-based measure. We estimate equity 3's, 3c, using daily stock returns,
returns on the S&P 500, and a Dimson (1979) correction. Returns are used from 540
to 60 days before the transaction is announced. To obtain 13, we unlever 3C:
(4)   ( = [xE+39xP+xD]/[E+P+Dx(1-TaxRate)]
where B equals the market value of firm equity 60 days before the transactions is
announced, P equals the (book) liquidation value of non-convertible preferred stock, and
D equals net debt — the book value of short-term and long-term debt, less cash and
marketable securities at the time of the transaction. We assume the systematic risk of
the preferred stock and the debt, 3" and 13d, with respect to returns on the S&P 500 equal
0.25 — the beta reported for high grade debt from 1977 to 1989 in Cornell and Green



                                             8
(1991).6 Finally, the tax rate equals the combined marginal federal and state tax rate
during the estimation period.
           Second, we use an industry-based measure of systematic risk. We calculate
industiy equity betas using daily returns from a value-weighted portfolio of all New
York and American Stock Exchange companies in the same two-digit SIC code as the
sample companies. The industiy equity betas are calculated from 540 to 60 days before
the transaction is announced using returns on the S&P 500, and a Dimson (1979)
correction. We use (4) to unlever the industzy equity betas with the value-weighted
ratios of equity, preferred, and debt to total capital for firms in the relevant industry.
These industiy ratios are calculated using COMPUSTAT data for the fiscal year ending
before the HLT is announced.
           Third, we use a market-based measure of systematic risk in which we assume
that the systematic risk for all sample firms equals the risk of the assets of the market
To obtain the market asset beta, we calculate the leverage of non-fmancial and non-
utility firms in the S&P 500 using the defmition from (4). The median leverage ratio
during the sample period, 1983-1989, was 0.20. Combining the market leverage in the
year before the transaction and a debt beta of 0.25, the median unlevered asset beta for
the market equals 0.93.
           We calculate risk premiums as the arithmetic average return spread between
the S&P 500 and long-term Treasuiy bonds from 1926 until the year before the
transaction is announced. For our sample firms, the median risk premium is 7.42%.
In using this risk premium, we implicitly assume that the experience of the previous 60
years (or so) is the best predictor of the future. Some readers may view this assumption
as overly aggressive. Blanchard (1994), for example, argues that the risk premium
declined to 3% to 4% by the end of the 1980s. We follow the general practice in
finance texts in using the historical risk premium. [For example, see Brealey and Myers


    6
        Given that the preferred stock is not convertible, we view this as a reasonable
assumption. In any case, this will have a small impact on the results because only 7 of
the sample companies have any such preferred outstanding.

(1991)]. The reasonableness of our choice is an empirical question that we implicitly
                                   consider in section 5. We also use the long-term
test in section 4 and explicitly

term investment horizon. For a short-term horizon, we estimate the risk-free rate as

 long-term Treasury bond yield less the historic arithmetic average spread
 Treasury bond and Treasury bill returns, and we use a risk premium equal to the long-
 term arithmetic average return spread between the S&P 500 and Treasury bills.


          2.3        Valuation Methods Using Comparables
          Practitioners often value companies using trading ortransaction multiples. In
 these methods, a ratio of a performance measure like EB1TDA to value is calculated for
                                                                               ratio from
 a set of guideline or comparable firms. Value is estimated by multiplying the
 the guideline companies by the performance measure for the company being valued.
           Valuation by comparables or multiples relies on two assumptions. First, the
                                                cash flow expectations and risks as the
  comparable companies have proportional future
  firm being valued. And second, the performance measure (like EB1TDA) is actually
  proportional to value.   If these assumptions are valid, the comparable method will
  provide at least as accurate a measure ofvalue as any discounted cash flow approach
                                                                of future cash flows and
  because it incorporates contemporaneous market expectations
  discount rates in the multiple. In practice, however, the comparable companies are not
  perfect matches in the sense that cash flows and risks are not proportional. Also, there
                                                                                      cash
  is no obvious method to determine which measure of performance — EBITDA,
                                                                                      with
  flow, net income, and so on — is the appropriate basis of comparison. Consistent
  these concerns, Kim and Ritter (1994) find that comparable methods are not particularly
  successful in pricing initial public offerings.


                                              10
         The discounted cash flow method relies on forecast cash flows which directly
relate to the firm being valued and discount rates which are based on the historical
riskiness of the company (in the firm beta valuations) or industry (in the industry beta
valuations) being valued. The reliability of the discounted cash flow valuation depends
on the accuracy of the cash flow projections, risk measures, and the assumptions used
in calculating the cost of capital, including the historical measure of the risk premium.
Both the discounted cash flow methods and the comparable firm methods therefore have
inherent estimation errors. The empirical issue is whether the firm-specific information
used in the discounted cash flow method offsets the lack of contemporaneous measures
of market expectations contained in the comparable methods.
         To make the values estimated with multiples comparable to those estimated
using capital cash flows, we base our multiples on EBITDA. We use three different
measures of guideline or comparable companies. The first, which we label comparable
company, uses a multiple calculated from the trading values of firms in the same
industry as the firm being valued. The second, which we label comparable transaction,
uses a multiple from companies that were involved in a similar transaction to the
company being valued. The third, which we label comparable industry transaction,
uses a multiple from companies in the same industry that were involved in a similar
transaction to the company being valued.
          We construct comparable company value as the sample firm's EBITDA in the
year before the transaction multiplied by the median industry multiple of total capital
value in the month of the transaction to EBITDA in the year before the transaction.
 Total capital value is the analog of transaction value, equalling the sum of the market
 value of common stock, the liquidation value of firm preferred stock, and the book
 value of firm short- and long-term debt, less the cash balances and marketable securities
 of the firm. To get as close a match as possible, we calculated the industry multiples
 using companies with the same four-digit SIC code and with total capitalizations of at
 least $40 million. If we found fewer than five comparable companies, we repeated the
 calculation at the three-digit level, and, if necessary, at the two-digit level.


                                              11
         We calculate comparable transaction value as the sample firm's EBITDA in
the year before the transaction times the median ratio of total transaction value to
EB1TDA (in the year before the transaction) for comparable HILTs. Comparable HLTs
are those HLTs among the 136 in Kaplan and Stein (1990 and 1993) that are priced
within one year of the date the sample transaction is priced.
         Comparable industiy transaction values combine the comparable company and
comparable transaction approaches by estimating comparable transaction values for
HLTs in the same industiy. We use the sample firm's EBITDA in the year before the
transaction times the median multiple of total transaction value to EBITDA in the year
before the transaction for HLTs in the same 2-digit SIC code that are priced within two
years of the date the sample transaction is priced. We are unable to obtain an
acceptable comparable industry HILT for more than one-quarter of the HLTs (13 of 51),
and, therefore, the sample size for this measure is lower. Because the sample from
which we draw the comparables includes a large fraction of the HLT universe, we do
not believe this is a sample specific problem.


3.       Data
          Our sample of companies starts with two sources of highly leveraged
transactions. First, we use the sample of 124 management buyouts (MBOs) analyzed
by Kaplan and Stein (1993). These buyouts met four conditions: (1) the companies are
originally publicly owned; (2) the transaction is completed between 1980 and 1989; (3)
at least one member of the incumbent management team obtains an equity interest in
the new private firm; and (4) the total transaction value exceeds $100 million.
          We add to this the sample of 12 leveraged recapitalizations examined by
Kaplan and Stein (1990). A leveraged recapitalization is similar to a MBO in many
respects except that it does not involve the repurchase of all of a company's stock.
While there is a dramatic increase in leverage, public stockholders retain some interest
in the company. These leveraged recapitalizations were completed between 1985 and
1989.


                                          12
          We study these transactions because they are subject to Rule 13E-3 of the
 Securities and Exchange Act. Rule 13E-3 applies to transactions in which insiders
potentially stand to benefit at the expense of outside, public shareholders. Item 8 of
Rule 13E-3 requires the HLT's board of directors to indicate whether that the
transaction is fair (or unfair) to public shareholders, and to provide a detailed discussion
of the basis for that opinion. Item 9 further requires the HLT board to furnish a
summary of any report or appraisal from an outside party that relates to the opinion in
Item 8. The disclosure in Item 9 usually includes some cash flow forecasts.
          We examined the documents describing the transactions that these firms filed
with the SEC. These documents include proxy statements, Schedule l4D tender offer
filings, and Schedule 13E-3 filings. All but 12 of the 136 companies provide some
post-transaction financial projections or forecasts. Unfortunately, the forecasts do not
always include enough information to do a complete valuation.
          We include in our sample those companies that provide at least four years of
post-transaction projections for (1) operating income before interest, depreciation,
amortization, and taxes; (2) depreciation and amortization; (3) capital expenditures; (4)
change in net working capital. These cash flows are the minimum required to calculate
the capital cash flows. In two additional cases, commercial bankers provided us with
projections distributed by buyout promoters at the time of the transaction that were not
available in SEC documents. We obtained the required information for 51 of the 136
1-ILTs. Twenty-two of these companies provide ten years of cash flow projections;
three, nine years; three, eight years; one, seven years; seven, six years; fourteen, five
years; and one, four years.
          Table 1 shows the number of transactions with complete projections by year
of the transaction. This sample is time-clustered. Almost one-half of the transactions
were completed in 1988. All but six of the transactions were completed between 1986
and 1989. Table I also distinguishes between MBOs and recapitalizations: forty-three
transactions are MIBOs while eight are recapitalizations.
          Finally, table 1 reports that in thirty-three transactions, the financial projections


                                             13
explicitly state that they reflect the buyout or recapitalization. The remaining eighteen
state that the projections do not reflect the transaction. Unfortunately, the meaning of
this statement is not always clear. Not reflecting the transaction may simply mean that
the projections do not reflect the proposed capital structure.       Alternatively, the
projections may not reflect expected operating changes. The compressed APY estimates
for the 33 forecasts that reflect the transactions tend to have lower mean squared and
mean absolute errors than those for the 18 forecasts that are ambiguous. These
differences, however, are not statistically significant.
          For each transaction with complete projections, we obtain information
describing the transactions from proxy, 13E-3, or 14D statements. Stock prices two
months before the transaction announcement and at transaction completion are obtained
from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database and Standard & Poor's
Daily Stock Price Record . Other financial data are obtained from the COMPUSTAT
Tapes. For more details on these transactions, see Kaplan and Stein (1990 and 1993).
          In section 6, we address possible endogeneity issues by performing similar
analyses for cash flow forecasts of a smaller sample of eight initial public offerings
(IPOs) completed between October, 1991 and July, 1992. The IPO firms are firms that
had previously gone private in leveraged buyouts. These cash flow forecasts are not
available in SEC documents. Because the IPOs involved refinancing existing loans, the
IPO firms provided cash flow forecasts to commercial bankers who held the loans, and
we obtained the forecasts from those bankers.


4.        Valuation Results.
          4.1       Compressed APV Methods
          Panel I of table 2 presents summary statistics for the valuation or estimation
errors of the three discounted cash flow and three comparable valuation methods. The
errors are computed as the log of the ratio of our estimated values to the transaction
value. Because we present the errors in percent, they can be interpreted as the
percentage differences between the estimated value and the transaction value. For


                                            14
example, focusing on the Compressed APV estimate using firm-specific betas, the
median error is 6.0% which means that DCF estimate is 6.0% greater than the
transaction value. Across the Compressed APV measures, the median errors are 3.2%
when industry-based estimates are used, and 1.0% when market-based estimates are
used. The mean errors are similar with the firm-based estimates overestimating
transaction values the most, industry-based estimates exhibiting less of an over-estimate,
and market-based estimates being closest to transaction value. The variation in the
valuation errors is greatest for the firm-based beta estimates, as well.
          The errors across the Compressed APV methods are related to the estimated
asset betas. The median firm-based asset beta is 0.85, which is smaller than the median
industry-based asset beta of 0.88, which, in turn, is smaller than the median market-
based asset beta of 0.93. A higher beta increases the discount rate which in turn
decreases the estimated value. Across the methods of estimating beta we examine, the
higher the beta, the lower the estimated error.
          The sensitivity of valuation errors to beta suggests that recommendations to
use lower risk premiums and higher terminal value growth rates would reduce the
accuracy of discounted cash flow estimates of value. Panels II and Ill of table 3 show
that this is the case by reporting the sensitivity of our valuation errors to changes,
respectively, in the risk premium and terminal value growth rates. For example, if we
use a risk premium of 6%, the median errors increase to 15.9% for the firm-based beta
estimates, to 14.1% for the industry-based estimates, and to 12.4% for the market-based
estimates. In contrast, when a higher risk premium is used, such as 9%, the median
errors of the firm-based, industry-based, and market-based errors decline, with errors of
-3.3%, -6.3%, and -9.2% respectively.
          We also experimented with beta estimation techniques that adjust for the
tendency of betas to regress to the mean in future periods.7 These adjustments included
using (1) equity betas equal to an equal weighted average of the firm or industry beta



    '   See   Blume (1975) and Klemkosky and Martin (1975).

                                            15
and the market beta, i.e., estimates that push the firm or industry equity betas closer to
one; (2) the Bayesian approach in Vasicek (1973) which estimates equity betas as a
weighted average of firm equity betas and the sample mean using the historical
distribution of the sample beta coefficients; and (3) the Bayesian approach in Stevens
(1993) which estimates equity betas using information in firm equity betas and industry
betas. These methods are basically weighted averages of the methods we present in
Table 2, and the results using these different techniques are roughly combinations of
those reported in Table 2.


           4.2      Comparable Methods
           Panel I of Table 2 also reports the valuation errors when value is estimated
using the three comparable methods. The estimates based on the comparable company
method substantially underestimate transaction value, with a median estimation error of
-18.1%. This is well outside the range of median errors for the Compressed APV
methods.
           The comparable transaction based estimates are more accurate, with a median
error of 5.9%, which is in the range of median errors for the Compressed APV
estimates. In fact, the mean valuation error of 0.3% for the comparable transactions is
lower than the mean valuation error for the Compressed APV estimates. The most
accurate estimates are those for the comparable industry transaction method with median
and mean valuation errors below 1%. This method has the highest standard deviation,
however, suggesting that the accuracy varies across firms in the sample. Furthermore,
the results highlight the fact that the method is not generally applicable because it is
difficult to match both the industry and the transaction. As noted above, we were
unable to find matches for 13 of the 51 firms in our sample during a period in which
there were a relatively large number of HLTs. In other samples and time periods, we
suspect this problem would be even worse. This method also is difficult to generalize
to other common valuation problems, such as capital investment decisions, because
there is typically no transaction to match.


                                              16
          We also examined (but do not report in the tables) a hybrid approach in which
we use the capital cash flows in the forecast period and the comparable company
EBITDA multiple to estimate the terminal value — multiplying it by the EBITDA
forecast in the fmal year of the projections. We then discount the capital cash flows
and terminal value at the discount rate for one of the three APV approaches. This
approach yields estimated values that are significantly higher than the transaction values.
For example, using a market-based discount rate, we find that the median estimated
value exceeds the transaction value by 18.1%.           One explanation for the poor
performance of this hybrid is that the EBITDA multiple at the time of the transaction
includes a weighted average of higher growth during the forecast period and lower
growth after the forecast period. By using the cash flows forecast over the forecast
period and then applying the EBITDA multiple at the end of the period, the hybrid
approach effectively double counts the higher growth during the forecast period.


          4.3       Comparative Performance of Valuation Methods
          The previous results suggest that both the Compressed APV and the
comparable valuation methods are useful in estimating transaction values. In this
section, we compare the Compressed APV and comparable valuation methods in greater
detail, using four measures of performance. The first three measures take an ex ante
perspective and assume that the transaction value is the "true" value. These measure
are also symmetric because they assume that under- and over-valuations are equally
costly. Because they are based on market prices, we view these three cx ante measures
as the most appropriate for judging the performance of the valuation methods.
Nevertheless, we also present a fourth performance measure that makes use of cx post
outcomes and, therefore, does not assume that the transaction value is the "true" value.


                    4.3.1     Percentage of Transactions Within 15 Percent
          Panel II.! of table 2 reports the percentage of transactions in which the
absolute value of the valuation error is less than or equal to 15%. Although it is


                                            17
somewhat arbitrary, we interpret a 15% error as a "small" error — smaller than the
typical premiums of 40% or greater associated with these transactions, and smaller than
the factor of two used in Black (1986) to define efficiency. (Our results are similar
when we use windows of 10% or 20%.)
         The estimates using the finn-based Compressed APV method are within 15%
of transaction value for almost one-half of the sample. The industry-based and the
market-based estimates do better, with more than 60% of the estimates within 15% of
transaction value.
          The comparable company method and comparable transaction estimates are
less successful than the Compressed APV methods. Only 37% of the comparable
company values and 47% of the comparable transaction estimates are within 15%. The
percentages for the industry-based and market-based APV methods are significantly
greater (at the 10% level or better) than those for the comparable company method.
The percentage for the industry-based APV method is also significantly greater than that
for the comparable transaction method.
          In the 38 transactions for which we can apply the comparable approach that
matches both industry and transaction, 58% of the valuation errors are less than 15%.
This comparable method therefore has about the same percentage of errors within 15%
as the Compressed APV methods.


                     4.3.2   Mean Absolute Error
          The second performance measure is the mean absolute error of the valuation
 errors (MAE). This assumes that under- and over-valuations are equally costly and that
 the cost of valuation errors increases linearly. The MAE is 20% for the Compressed
 APV using the firm-based betas, and less than 17% for the estimates using industry- and
 market-based betas. The comparable methods have generally higher MAEs; 24.7% for
 company-based comparables, 18.1% for transaction-based comparables, and 20.5% for
 industry- and transaction-based comparables. The MAEs of the industry- and market-
 based APV methods are significantly smaller than the MAE of the comparable company


                                           18
method.


                   4.3.3     Mean Squared Error
          Our third measure is the mean squared error of the valuation errors (MSE).
This assumes that under- and over-valuations are equally costly and that the cost
increases are quadratic.    Using this measure, the comparable company and the
comparable industiy transaction methods perform poorly — with higher mean squared
errors than any APV method. The comparable transaction method, in contrast, does
best, performing slightly (but insignificantly) better than the industiy-based method
(MSE of 5.5%) and the market-based method (MSE of 5.0%). The comparable
company method MSE is significantly greater than the market-based method MSE and
the comparable transaction MSE.


                   4.3.4     Summary of Ex Ante Measures
          We conclude, based on the results presented in Table 2, that the Compressed
APV techniques provide a reasonable and accurate measure of value. The median and
mean estimation errors are below 6.3% for all Compressed APV methods. And the
valuation errors have a strong tendency towards zero, with about 50% or more of the
estimated values being within 15% of the transaction value. If we had to choose among
the three Compressed APV methods, we would pick the industry-based or market-based
beta approaches. The Compressed APV method using these two approaches have a
roughly equal ability to predict transaction values.
          Among the comparable methods, the comparable firm method performs poorly
in every dimension.     It is the least reliable valuation method we examine. The
comparable transaction along with the comparable method matching industry and
transaction work better than the comparable firm method, and, work almost as well as
the Compressed APV methods.
          We favor the Compressed APV methods for three reasons.           First, the
Compressed APV methods have more valuation errors within 15%, and lower MAEs


                                           19
and MSEs. Second, we think that in practice participants are likely to have access to
better estimates of cash flows and other inputs into the Compressed APV method than
we have had available to. us. On the other hand, we think that our information on
comparables — especially on comparable transactions — is close to the information that
would have been used in practice.        Thus, we think practical application of the
Compressed APV method will improve its accuracy. Third, the comparable methods
that work best are based on transactions, and therefore have little applicability beyond
a transaction context. In contrast, the Compressed APV method can be used in a
variety of corporate finance applications. This criticism is relevant even in the current
sample for the comparable industry transaction method because that method fails to
produce estimated values for more than one-quarter of the sample HLTs.


                      4.3.5   Performance Based on Outcomes
          Our fmal measure of performance makes use of ex post evidence on whether
the sample companies have defaulted on their debt after the transaction.           As of
December 1993, 17 of the 51 sample companies had defaulted. This is a noisy
measure of transaction success from the viewpoint of lenders and equity investors.
 Some transactions that have not defaulted may default in the future or yield low returns
to their investors. This measure is also noisy in that it is almost sure to reflect events
 that were not expected at the time of the HLTs.
           Our performance measure is the percentage of mistakes made by the various
 methods based on ex post outcomes. The estimated values can be mistaken in two
 ways. First, if the estimated value exceeds the transaction value and the HLT
 subsequently defaults on its debt payments, the estimated value accepted a bad deal.
 Second, if the estimated value is less than the transaction value and the HLT does not
 default on its debt payments, the estimated value rejected a good deal. Our cx post
 measure of mistakes places no weight on how far the estimated value is from the
 transaction value.
           In panel II of table 2, the firm-based Compressed APV method and the


                                            20
comparable industiy transaction method make the smallest percentage of errors, ex post;
the market-based Compressed APV method makes the most. Even the best of these
methods is mistaken more than 40% of the time. Overall, the Compressed APV
methods and comparable methods perform about equally well (or badly). The only
significant difference is that between the percentage of errors of the market-based
Compressed APV method and the comparable industry transaction method. Again,
however, the performance of the comparable industry transaction method is overstated
because the method fails to produce estimated values for more than one-quarter of the
sample HLTs.


             4.4      Cross-sectional Relation of Estimated Values to Transaction Values
             The results in the previous sections focus on how well the Compressed APV
and comparable valuation approaches estimate the actual transaction value level. It is
possible, however, that one of the approaches could successfully estimate the transaction
value on average, yet perform poorly in explaining the variation in transaction values.
The converse is also possible. In this section, we consider these possibilities by
estimating regressions to determine how well the different valuation methods explain
the variation in transaction values. With a regression approach, we can also test
whether using the DCF and comparable approaches together can explain additional
variation.
             The regressions relate transaction values to estimated values from the
Compressed APV and comparable methods. The basic model we want to estimate is:
(5) Transaction Value = a +           3 EstimatedValue + c
If the estimated values are unbiased predictors of transaction value, the coefficient
estimates for the intercept will be zero and for the slope, will be one. The key question
with this model is the specification. It seems likely that the intercept term and the error
term will be related to value or size. Accordingly, we present two specifications. First,
we regress the log of transaction value on the log of estimated value. This assumes that
the residuals from the model are proportional to value. Second, we eliminate size


                                            21
entirely by regressing the transaction value as a multiple of EBITDA on estimated
value, again expressed as a multiple of EBITDA.
         Column 1 of Table 4 presents the regression results for the log-log
specification. The estimates from the three Compressed APV approaches in column 1
are consistent with the approach providing unbiased estimates of transaction values.
The intercepts are all insignificantly different from zero, and the slopes are all
insignificantly different from one. Furthermore, the estimated values explain virtually
all the variation in transaction values and the residuals from the log-log specification
are well-behaved — there is no evidence of heteroscedasticity or undue influence from
large observations. Again, the Compressed APV methods perform at least as well as
the comparable methods. The comparable value methods explain a similar amount of
variation in transaction value, but the intercepts are larger. In fact, the intercept in the
comparable company regression is significantly larger than 0, indicating it is a biased
estimator of transaction value.
          It is possible that the different valuation approaches contain different
information about transaction values. Accordingly, column 2 presents estimates of a
regression that includes as independent variables the market-based Compressed APV
values, the comparable company values, and comparable transaction values. All three
variables are statistically significant, the intercept term is not significantly different from
0, and the variables together explain a bit more variation in transaction value than any
one of them does alone.
          In some sense, however, the DCF and comparable approaches arc too
successful in explaining the variation in transaction values using the log-log
specification. Although the residuals in the regressions are well-behaved, the log-log
specifications may perform so well because they regress measures of size on size. For
the second set of regressions, we eliminate size by scaling transaction values and


       We do not present regressions using the comparable industry transaction estimated
 values because the regressions include only 38 observations and because those values
 explain less variation in transaction value than the other two comparable methods.

                                              22
estimated values by EBITDA in the year before the transaction. We then regress the
resultant transaction value multiples on the estimated value multiples:
(6) Transaction Value Multiple = a        +   13
                                                   Estimated Value Multiple + c
This specification is particularly interesting because it was customary to price HLTs as
multiples of EBITDA. [See Kaplan (1989b) and DeAngelo (1990)].
          Table 4 presents results of both log-log and level-level specifications for these
regressions. Again, we prefer the log-log specification because it assumes a more
reasonable multiplicative error structure. In column 3, the estimates from the three APV

approaches explain from 35% to 46% of the variation in the transaction multiples. The
industiy-based approach explains the most variation; the firm-based approach, the least.
In contrast, the comparable company and comparable transaction multiples explain much
less of that variation, respectively, 22% and 9%. Although not reported the comparable
industry transaction multiples explain only 5% of the variation.
          While they explain an impressive amount of variation in transaction multiples,
there is one respect in which the Compressed APV multiples may seem disappointing.
The constant terms in the regressions differ significantly from zero and the slope
coefficients differ significantly from one. The likely explanation is that the constant
term measures the contribution of EBITDA in explaining transaction value. This can
be seen by multiplying (6) by EBITDA to recast the regression in levels:
(6') Transaction Value = a EBITDA + 13 Estimated Value + 8'
If, as is likely, the estimated values are measured with some error, and EBITDA is
correlated with the estimated values, a in (6) will not equal zero, and 13 will note equal
one. (We also estimated the reverse regressions in which the transaction value is the
independent value and the estimated values are the dependent variables. In those
 regressions, only one slope coefficient in the APV estimate reverse regressions, that
 using the market-based APV values, differs significantly from one, at the 10% level,
 whereas the slope coefficients in all of the comparable estimate reverse regressions do.)
           In column 4 (and column 6) of table 4 we present the results of a regression
 that, again, includes the market-based APV multiples, the comparable company
 multiples, and the comparable transaction multiples. The APV and comparable

                                              23
multiples together explain almost 50% of the variation in transaction multiples. The
coefficients indicate that the APV and comparable company methods both have
significant explanatoxy power for transaction multiples. Although the comparable
transaction multiple has the largest coefficient, that coefficient is not significant Again,
these regression results suggest that it is worthwhile to combine the information in the
APV and comparable approaches.
          Overall, the univariate regression results indicate that the APV approaches
perform well relative to the comparable approaches in explaining variation in transaction
values and multiples. The APV approaches are individually superior to the comparable
approaches in explaining the variation in transaction multiples. We interpret these
results as additional evidence in favor of the usefulness of the discounted value
approaches. Choosing among the three APV methods, we prefer the industiy-based and
market-based approaches. These approaches perform well in estimating both the level
of the transaction value and in explaining variation in transaction value.


5.        Implied Cost of Capital
          In this section, we revisit the risk premium which is used in our Compressed
APV calculations. We devote special attention to the risk premium because there is
substantial debate about how the risk premium should be measured. Some rely on the
method we prefer which is a long-term arithmetic average of the historical spread
between a market index and riskiess bonds. Others prefer (incorrectly, in our opinion)
a geometric average over a long or short time period. These methods provide
substantially different measures of risk premiums. For example, the geometric average
spread is 5.4 1% which is roughly 2% below the median arithmetic average spread we
use of 7.42%.
          We invert are analysis to derive the discount rates implied by the transaction
values to provide direct empirical evidence about the risk premium. We use the same
forecast capital cash flows and terminal values to calculate an implied discount rate or
cost of capital which equates the estimated value to the transaction value. The implied


                                            24
risk premium equals the difference between the implied discount rate and the yield on
long-term Treasury bonds at the time of the projections. The implied risk premium
represents the product of the implied market equity risk premium and an asset beta. We
estimate an implied market equity risk premium by dividing the implied risk premium
by our market-based asset beta (where the market-based asset beta is calculated using
the value weighted capital structure for non-financial, non-utility firms in the S&P 500
in the fiscal year before the HLT announcement).


          5.1         Implied Discount Rates, Risk Premiums, and Market Equity Risk
                      Premiums
          Using our assumption of 4% growth in calculating terminal values, table 5
reports that the median implied discount rate for the 51 1-ILTs is I 5.77%, the mean is
16.28%, and the standard deviation is 2.69%. The implied risk premium, calculated by
subtracting the contemporaneous long-term Treasury bond yield has a median of 7.07%,
a mean of 7.14%, and a standard deviation of 2.76%. The median implied market
equity risk premium is 7.55%, the mean is 7.74%, and the standard deviation is 2.95%.
We do not find any variation over time in the implied market equity risk premiums.
Admittedly, such variation might be hard to detect given the clustering of our sample
 in the late 1980s.
           Table 5 also presents implied discount rates, risk premiums, and market equity
 risk premiums assuming terminal value growth rates of 6%, 2%, and 0%. Not
 surprisingly, the risk premiums vary with the terminal value growth rate. The implied
 market equity risk premium drops to 5.00% with no terminal value growth and increases
 to 8.81% with 6% terminal value growth. As we noted earlier, we feel that a 4%
 growth rate is the economically most plausible assumption.
         Like the evidence in section 4, the risk premium results strongly suggest that
 the Compressed APV technique works best when an arithmetic average risk premium
 is used. The estimated market equity risk premium is remarkably close to the 7.42%
 median risk premium (calculated using the long-term arithmetic average of the spread


                                            25
between the S&P 500 index and long-term Treasury bonds) we use for our Compressed
APV estimates. There is no evidence that the use of lower risk premiums, however
obtained, would improve the accuracy of discounted cash flow techniques.


         5.2        Relation of Implied Risk Premiums to Systematic Rislç Size, and
                    Book-to-Market
         In this section, we examine the relation between our implied risk premiums
and (1) firm asset betas; (2) industry asset betas; (3) transaction size; and (4) company
book-to-market ratios (in the fiscal year ending before the transaction is announced).
Our examination is motivated by two findings. First, Fama and French (1992) report
that equity returns are negatively related to firm size, positively related to the book-to-
market ratio and, controlling for firm size and book-to-market ratio, unrelated to equity
betas. Second, our results, reported in section 4, indicate that the Compressed APV
method using market-based betas works about as well as industry-based betas. Both of
these results are contrary to the generally accepted notion that expected returns are
related to systematic risk. By examining the determinants of the individual implied risk
premiums in our sample, we provide evidence on how the market determines expected
returns. We use pre-transaction book-to-market ratios because book-to-market ratios at
the time the transaction is completed equal one for all management buyouts and are
typically negative for leveraged recapitalizations.9
          Table 6 presents univariate regressions of the risk measures on the implied risk
premium. The regressions indicate that the implied risk premium is positively related
to both beta measures. In the two univariate regressions, neither of the coefficients on
the betas is statistically significant at the 10% level (using a two-tailed test). The
insignificance of the regression coefficient for the industry beta appears to be caused by
outliers. Non-parametric rank tests indicate that the risk premium is significantly related




     In our regressions, we exclude observations with negative pre-transaction book-to-
market ratios.

                                            26
to industry betas (at the 5% level).
         While the risk premiums are marginally related to the betas, table 6 indicates
that the implied risk premiums are not related to firm size — (the log of) transaction
value — or to the pre-buyout book-to-market ratio. Non-parametric rank correlations
also fail to identif' any significant relation between the risk premium and either size or
the book-to-market ratio.
          The patterns are qualitatively similar when one of the betas, size, and book-to-
market ratios are included in the same regression. In fact, the firm asset beta becomes
significant at the 10% level in the multiple regression. Overall, these results suggest
a positive relationship between expected returns and systematic or beta risk, but provide
no basis for concluding that discounted cash flow valuations could be improved by
basing discount rates on firm size or market-to-book ratios.


6.        Potential Endogeneity or Hardwiring of Cash Flow Forecasts.
          The previous sections indicate that the Compressed APV valuation approaches
provide reasonably accurate estimates of transaction values. This is somewhat surprising
because HLTs provide significant valuation challenges because of their high levels of
debt. The success of the Compressed APV approaches in valuing these complex HLTs
 raises the question of whether there is something special about our sample of HLTs that
 makes the Compressed APV technique so effective, and whether there are reasons to
 doubt that the APV methods will work as well in practice as they do in our tests.
          The primary concern is that the cash flows might somehow be endogenous,
 and that the endogeneity causes the Compressed APV valuations to be spurious
 estimates of transaction value. One potential source of endogeneity is that dealmakers
 and managers in the HLTs in our sample may have had incentives to adjust the cash




                                             27
flow forecasts)° If the transaction value and financial structure are determined by
competition in the market for corporate control, dealmakers may have an incentive to
construct their cash flow forecasts to justif' the price and to convince lenders and
investors to finance the transactions. The transaction value and financial structure imply
a sequence of required interest and principal payments, and the forecast cash flows have
to exceed those debt payments for the transaction to be feasible. Because the sample
transactions are largely debt fmanced (a median 88% of transaction value), cash flows
that are constructed to exceed debt payments would be "hardwired" in the sense that
cash flows are constructed so that their present value will yield the transaction value.


          One implication of hardwiring is that the cash flow forecasts are adjusted
upward or downward to approximate the required debt payments. Incentives to bias the
cash flow forecasts upward may occur when true expected cash flows are below the
level required to obtain financing. Incentives to bias the cash flows downward may
occur when the true expected cash flows are substantially in excess of those required
to obtain financing. Because the SEC and courts require the FILT firm's board of
directors to obtain an opinion from an investment bank that the transaction value is
"fair," insiders and dealmakers may have an incentive to reduce their reported cash flow
forecasts to justify the transaction value.
          As an illustration of hardwiring, consider a typical HLT that fmances 55% of
transaction value with bank debt at a nominal rate that exceeds the Treasury bond rate
by 1.5%; approximately 35% of transaction value with subordinated debt at a nominal
rate that exceeds the Treasury bond rate by 4.5%; and approximately 10% of transaction
value with equity at an unknown rate of return over the Treasury bond. Assuming



    '° For example, although it is not in our sample, there is some evidence that the
managers at Interco made such adjustments during the financing of their leveraged
recapitalization. See "Fiction in, Fiction out" by Laura Jereski, Forbes, December 9,
1991, page 292. See also Burrough and Helyar (1990) for a description of how cash
flows were forecast in the RJR Nabisco buyout.

                                              28
equity yields a nominal return at least 4.5% over the Treasury bond, hardwiring would
put a lower bound on the internal rate of return equal to the Treasury bond yield plus
2.85%.
          The Treasury bond yield plus 2.85% is substantially below the implied
discount rate (the Treasury bond yield plus 7.07%) that we estimate in Section 5,
suggesting that our basic empirical findings are not confounded by hardwiring.
Furthermore, hardwiring implies that all parties -- investors, courts, investment banks,
etc. — use methods like Compressed APV to determine the transaction value. Although

we doubt that the Compressed APV method works simply because everyone uses it, we
take the hardwiring criticism seriously and perform four additional tests for evidence
of hardwiring.


          6.1       Ex post Accuracy of Cash Flow Forecasts
          If the forecast cash flows are biased either upward or downward, there should
be differences between the forecasts and the realizations. This is difficult to test
because we know of no method to directly measure the ex ante bias, if any, in the
forecasts. We rely, therefore, on ex post data to gauge the accuracy of the forecasts.
Using ex post data to assess the forecasts is, however, complicated because the U.S.
 economy entered a recession in 1990, less than two years after the majority of these
 transactions. The forecasts were unlikely to anticipate the recession and thus, even if
 the forecasts were unbiased ex ante estimates of expected cash flows, we anticipate that
 the actual cash flows will exceed the forecasts. Nevertheless, we examine the ex post
 accuracy of the projections by comparing forecast EBITDA to post-transaction
 EBITDA. We also examine EBITDA margins because the recession as well as asset
 sales not considered in the projections should have had less effect on margins.
           We are able to obtain at least one year of post-transaction data for 46 of the
 51 sample HLTs. In the first and second complete fiscal years after the HLT, EB1TDA
 levels are, respectively, a median of 3.7% and 14.4% below those forecast, both of
 which are statistically significant at the 5% level. This is consistent with optimistic


                                            29
cash flow forecasts caused by either ex ante optimism or an unanticipated recession.
In contrast, we find only weak evidence that forecast EBITDA margins are biased.
EBITDA margins are below those forecast by a median of 3.2% and 3.6% of the
forecast margin, respectively, in the first and second years after the transaction. (If
EBITDA margins were forecast to equal 20.00% of sales, a 3.6% shortfall in margins
is equivalent to actual margins being 19.28% of sales.) The shortfall in the first year
is statistically insignificant, while the second year shortfall is significant only at the 10%
level. The EBITDA and EBITDA margin shortfalls are also smaller than those
documented in Kaplan (1989a) for an earlier sample of management buyouts. Overall,
therefore, there is weak evidence of optimistic EBITDA forecasts. But the closeness
of the forecast and realized EBITDA margins suggests that the difference between
forecast and actual EBITDA is related to the unanticipated recession instead of an ex
ante bias.


             6.2      Leverage
             If cash flows forecasts are hardwired to repay debt, the hardwiring effect and
the accuracy of the Compressed APV approaches should be more pronounced in more
highly leveraged transactions. We test this implication of hardwiring by dividing the
sample into firms that have above- and below-median post-transaction leverage (i.e.,
debt to transaction value). If hardwiring is causing our results, the Compressed APV
techniques should be more accurate for the high debt sub-sample.
             We do not find any significant difference in the performance of the
Compressed APV approaches for the two sub-samples. Using the market-based APV
approach, the estimated values are within 15% of transaction value for 56% of the low
 debt sub-sample and 65% of the high sub-sample. Also, the mean absolute error of the
 estimates in the lower debt sample is 17.1% of transaction value compared to 16.3% for
 the higher debt sample. Finally, the Compressed APV estimates (as multiples of
 EBITDA) for the lower debt sample explain more variation in transaction multiples than
 the estimates for the higher debt sample — 47% of the variation versus 29%.


                                              30
         6.3      Initial Public Offerings
         Hardwiring implies that the APV approaches should not work as well in
valuing companies that have little leverage. To explore the effectiveness of the
Compressed APV approach in valuing firms with substantially less leverage than our
HLT sample, we used the technique to estimate the value of finns in initial public
offerings. The IPOs are also interesting because dealmakers in IPOs face incentives
different from those in HLTs. In HLTs, cash flows may be upward biased to obtain
financing or downward biased to obtain a fairness opinion. In the IPOs in our sample,
there is an incentive to raise forecasts to get financing or get a higher price, but —
                                                                          associated
unlike HLTs — there is no incentive to lower forecasts. If hardwiring and
incentives are causing spurious results in our HLT sample, the Compressed APV
techniques should be higher and less accurate for the IPOs.
         We obtained detailed cash flow forecasts for eight initial public offerings
(IPOs) completed between October, 1991 and July, 1992. The IPOs all involved
refmancing of existing debt because the eight issuers were companies that had
                                        transactions. We calculate the transaction value
previously completed highly leveraged
 using the closing stock price on the day of the IPO. Based on this price, the median
 post-IPO leverage ratio of 52.6% is appreciably lower than the 87.9% for the sample
 HLTs.
          Table 7 presents the results using the market-based APV approach with
 terminal value growth rates of 4%, 6%, 2%, and 0%. As with the FILl sample, we
 focus on the results using the 4% terminal value growth rate. Because expected
 inflation was arguably lower in 1991 and 1992 than in the earlier liLT period, however,
 we also discuss the results for the 2% growth rate.
         Although the sample is small, the APV approach still performs fairly well.
 The median APV is 7.8% greater than firm value at a 4% terminal value growth rate,
 and 1 .9% less than firm value at a 2% terminal value growth rate. The APV estimates
 are within 15% of firm value in 50.0% of the IPOs using 4% terminal value growth


                                             31
(and 37.5% of the IPOs using a 2% terminal value growth). Although this is less often
than for the HLTs, such performance is as good as the comparable company and
comparable industry performance for the HLTs. Finally, the APV estimates explain
37% of the variation in IPO value multiples, or approximately as much of the variation
in FELT transaction value multiples that the DCF estimates explained.


          6.4       Contested and Uncontested HLTs
          Incentives to raise a cash flow forecast to justify a transaction ought to be
higher when there are other bidders or some other form of outside pressure. In such
situations, the failure to finance and complete the 1-ILT both increases the likelihood that
incumbent managers will lose their jobs (to the winning bidder) and ensures that
dealmakers will lose their transaction fees. This suggests that in transactions that
involve multiple bidders or hostile pressure, forecast cash flows ought to be higher
relative to true "expected" cash flows. If this is the case, ex post performance relative
to the forecasts ought to be lower. One might also argue that the APV estimates ought
to be closer to the transaction values — i.e., have smaller MAEs and MSEs — when
 there is hostile pressure. We find little support for these two hypotheses.
          In our sample, 18 firms explicitly received competing bids and additional 6
 firms experienced hostile pressure in the form of block share purchases by outside
 parties for a total of 24 firms with some form of outside pressure. There was no overt
 outside pressure for 27 transactions. The valuation errors are insignificantly different
 across the two sub-samples. Using a market-based APV approach (with 4% terminal
 value growth), the median APV estimate is 2.6% above the transaction value (mean is-
 0.2%) when there is outside pressure and 1.6% below the transaction value (mean is
 3.1%) when there is not. The Compressed APV estimates are more accurate, but
 insignificantly so, when there is outside pressure. For example, the mean absolute error
 for the outside pressure sample is 14.4% compared to 18.7% for the non-hostile sample.
 Also, 67% of the outside pressure APV estimates are within 15% of transaction value
 compared to 56% of the APV estimates with no outside pressure.


                                             32
          When we compare the ex post performance of the two sub-samples of 1-ILls
to the cash flow forecasts, we find no significant differences in EBITDA or EBITDA
margins. In the first and second post-transaction years, respectively, EBITDA levels are
a median of 9.5% and 13.6% below those forecast for the outside pressure transactions
and 2.8% and 20.5% below those forecast for the transactions with no outside pressure.
Similarly, EBITDA margins are a median of 6.1% and 2.6% below those forecast for
the outside pressure transactions and 2.0 and 4.6% below those forecast for the
transactions with no outside pressure.


          6.5       Discussion

          The four sets of tests we perform all fail to support the predictions of
hardwiring. In our view, there is no evidence to suggest that the reliability of the
Compressed APV methods is spurious. However, without ex ante evidence that the
cash flow forecasts are actually an estimate of expected cash flows, we cannot
completely eliminate the possibility that dealmakers systematically and materially
 adjusted their cash flow forecasts. There may have been other pressures or incentives
 that we have not examined. We have, however, shown that the most obvious (at least
 to us) possible biases in the forecasts do not receive strong support from our data.
          Furthermore, there are several reasons that adjustments to cash flows,
 especially larger ones, are costly. First, most of the dealmakers and investors in a
 particular HLT could expect to meet again in a future transaction.          There were

 undoubtedly some reputational incentives not to present fictional forecasts. Second, in
 transactions that ultimately fail, creditors can sue insiders under fraudulent conveyance
 law if the original transaction rendered the company insolvent (solvency test) or the
                                                                                  meet
 company had unreasonably small capital, i.e., insufficient forecast cash flow to
 debt payments (capital test). Both tests rely on the cash flow forecasts made at the time
 of the transaction. Courts and their examiners in fraudulent conveyance hearings have




                                            33
paid careful attention to whether the cash flow forecasts were "reasonable."1 The
failure of the Interco recapitalizatiofl received such an unusual amount of attention
precisely because the cash flow forecasts were considered to have been unreasonable.
          Finally, academic and anecdotal evidence suggest that bankers and buyout
specialists took the cash flow forecasts vely seriously. Anders (1992) writes that the
projections "took on a stature that was both awesome and terrifying to top executives.
Unlike budgets that executives devised, the bank-book projections were ironclad."
(Denis and Denis (1993) provide quantitative evidence that firms in recapitalizations
were constrained by such budgets.) At a minimum, managers could expect that failure
to meet .those projections would bring increased scrutiny and pressure from banks and
investors. To the extent that missed projections are followed by missed debt payments,
equity investors could expect to lose their investment and managers could expect to lose
their investment and their jobs.


 7.       Summary
          This study provides evidence that discounted cash flow valuation methods
 provide reliable estimates of market value. Our median estimates of discounted cash
 flows for 51 HLTs are within 10% of the market values of the completed transactions
 and perform at least as well as valuation approaches using companies in similar
 industries and companies involved in similar transactions. We stress that our estimates
 rely on a number of ad hoc assumptions that readers (both academics and practitioners)
 should be able to improve on. We would expect such improvements to bring the DCF
 valuations even closer to the transaction values.
           We use three CAPM-based approaches to estimate discount rates
 corresponding to firm-level, industry-level, and market-level measures of risk. All three
 methods perform well compared to those using comparable transactions and companies.




        See Luehrman and flirt (1991) and Baird (1991) for discussions of fraudulent
  conveyance law.

                                            34
Under what we consider the most realistic assumptions, the industzy- and market-based

approaches perform best.
         Although the DCF approaches perform at least as well as the comparable-
based approaches, we find that the comparable-based estimates add explanatory power
to the DCF-based estimates. Accordingly, we would recommend using information
from both types of approaches in practical valuation settings where comparable values
are available.
          In the second part of this paper, we use the forecast cash flows and transaction
values to calculate implied discount rates and risk premiums. The median implied
market equity risk premium, the amount by which the return on the equity market
                                                                accords well with the
 exceeds the long-term Treasury bond yield, equals 7.55%. This
 historical risk premium by which returns on the S&P 500 have exceeded Treasury bond
 returns. The relations between the implied risk premiums and both firm and industry
 betas are positive and marginally significant. In contrast, there are no apparent relations
 between the implied risk premiums and either transaction value, i.e., firm size, or book-
 to-market ratios. For this sample, therefore, the results favor CAPM-based approaches
 to discount rates over those based on size or book-to-market ratios.
