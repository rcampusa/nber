                  Credibility   and Monetary Policy


                                ABSTRACT

     The purpose of this papar is to describe and evaluate the most

important existing ideas concerning credibility of monetary policy, with

special emphasis given to matters pertaining to the U.S. economy and the

practices and procedures of the Fed. The main discussion begins with

Feilner's hypothesis that the costs of a disinflationary episode will be

smaller when the public believes that the disinflation will in fact be

carried out. This hypothesis has been challenged recently by several

writers; an evaluation of their evidence is attempted and some ne'w results

presented. Next, the discussion turns to positive analyses of the

monetary policy-making process. Models developed by Barro and Gordon

and others are examined, the object being to develop an understanding of

why certain features of monetary policy tend to prevail. The main

implications of this analysis are then used to consider various strategies

for obtaining a type of policy behavior that might produce better

macroeconomic results--less inflation with no more unemployment--than the

U.S. has experienced in the recent past. Particular proposals touched upon

include the adoption of a commodity-money standard, a balanced-budget

amendment, a legislated monetary rule, a nominal GNP target, and the

absorption of the Fed into the Treasury.

I. Introduction

     According to my dictionaries, "credibilityT' is the property of

being credible, with the later meaning roughly the same as believable.

So with this definition a policy lacks credibility if it is one that

could not reasonably be believed. It would appear that William

Fellner (1976) (1979), who introduced the idea into the macroeconomic

arena, chose this particular word because he believed that the U. S.

aggregate demand policy of the middle/late 1970's was unsustainable

and in that sense unbelievable. With the passage of time, the term

has come to be used in a slightly different way, in particular, as

meaning "believed" rather than "believable." In what follows, the

term will be used in this latter fashion: credibility obtains to the

extent that beliefs concerning policy conform to the way in which

policy is actually being conducted and to official announcements about

its conduct.

     It should be emphasized that this meaning is conceptually quite

distinct from that pertaining to a situation in which it is expected

that future rates of inflation will be small. As it happens, interest

in the notion was from the start stimulated by Fellner's argument that

a credible (believed) disinflation would be less costly, in terms of

foregone output, than one that the public expected to be aborted.

Because of this interest in disinflation, much of the discussion has

been conducted under the presumption that prevailing policy is of a

type that will lead to a low inflation rate in the future, which

circumstance implies an agreement between "correct beliefs" and "low

inflationary expectations." But these concepts are obviously quite
                              —2--

 different, and to define the term in the latter way would be to abuse

 language as well as to create unnecessary possibilities of confusion.

     A second distinction concerns phrases such as "credibility of

monetary policy." Here it is important to distinguish between policy

 as an ongoing process——a way of making decisions and taking actions——

 and the resulting period—by—period actions (instrument settings)

themselves. Thus the credibility of a policy is to be distinguished

from the credibility of the announcements pertaining to a particular

period. While the latter is certainly a concept of some interest,

economists' efforts are——for reasons explained by Lucas (1980)——

usually more fruitful when focused on the analysis of policies as

opposed to specific policy actions.

     The objective of the present paper is to describe and consider

the most important existing ideas concerning credibility of monetary

policy. Special emphasis is given to matters pertaining to the U. S.

economy and the practices and procedures of the Fed. Open—economy

aspects of the topic are, as in most of the literature, ignored. The

main discussion begins in Section II with a review of Feilner's

hypothesis that the costs of a disinflationary episode will be smaller

when the public believes that the disinflation will in fact be carried

out. This hypothesis has been challenged recently by B. Friedman

(1983), Gordon (1983), Perry (1983) and others; an evaluation of their

arguments is attempted and some new results presented. In Section

III, by contrast, the discussion centers on positive analyses of the

monetary policy—making process. Models developed by Barro and Gordon

(1983a)(1983b), Canzoneri (1983), and Cukierman and Meltzer (1984) are

examined, the object being to develop an understanding of why certain
                              —3—

features of monetary policy tend to prevail. The basic ideas of the

analysis are then applied in Section IV, which is concerned with

various strategies for obtaining a type of policy behavior that might

produce better macroeconomic results——less inflation with no more

unemployment——than the U. S. has experienced in the recent past.

Particular proposals touched upon include the adoptionof a commodity—

money standard, a balanced—budget amendment, a legislated monetary

rule, a nomInal GNP target, and the absorption of the Fed into the

Treasury. Some conclusions are suggested in Section V.

II. The Importance of Credibility

       The basic idea of the credibility hypothesis——that the foregone—

output costs of a disinflationary episode will be smaller if the

public correctly believes that the attempt will not be abandoned——is

familiar enough to require only a brief sketch. If, for example, the

economy's aggregate supply function (or Phillips relationship) is of

the form'

(1) y                      EtlApt) +       — h—]) +

with   u a purely random disturbance, then the inflation rate        can

be lowered without any deleterious effect on output relative to

capacity y —      provided that the reduction in      is correctly

anticipated by at least one period, while a cumulative output

reduction of 1I(1) will occur per unit decrease in         if the

latter is not anticipated. More generally, if instead of (1) the

supply function is of the nominal—contract type utilized by Fischer

(1977),


(2)       —   =        —
                           Eip)   +
                                            E2p) ÷ 2(E               1
                                                                         +

              +                 + u,
then each      reduction must be anticipated 2 periods in advance to

avoid all output costs, with an extension to J—period lags straight—

forward. These costs will, nevertheless, be smaller the smaller is

the excess of expected over actual inflation rates during the episode.1

The rather different contracts of the type employed in Tay1ors models

(l980)(1983a) also give rise to such effects, An interesting recent

analysis using a more general framework appears in Fischer (1984).
                                —5—

     Two or three years ago, the relevance of this credibility hypoth—

 esi' for the U.S. economy was, I believe, very widely accepted by

economists doing macroeconomic research. More recently, however, it

has been called into question on the basis of U.S. data referring to

the recent (1982—83) recession and slowing of inflation. In particular,

Friedman (1983) (1984), Gordon (1983) (1984), and Perry (1983) have

each suggested that the credibility hypothesis and its close intellectual

king, the "Lucas Critique," are factually incorrect. More specifically,

they have argued that conventional (i.e., non—rational expectation)

Phillips curve relationships based on pre—1980 data are consistent

with the disinflationary episode and that this would not be true if

the credibility hypothesis had empirical relevance.-1

     The most extreme of the positions taken in these papers is

expressed by Friedman (1983, p. 14), who indicates that the unemploy-

ment—inflation figures "are strikingly in line with the conventional

estimates of the cost of disinflation surveyed by Okun." This refer-

ence, of course, is to Arthur Okun's famous summary of six econometric

Phillips curves, which indicated that "the cost of a 1 point reduction

in the basic inflation rate is 10 percent of a year's GNP, with a

range [across models] of 6 to 18 percent" (Okun, 1978, p. 348). In

making his calculation, Friedman presumes that the episode lowered the

inflation rate by 5 percentage points and estimates that the incremental

unemployment during 1980—82 was about 5 point—years. These figures

would imply a sacrifice ratio    of only about 2.5 to 3.0 (depending

on the "Okun's Law" figure used to convert unemployment into output

loss), well below Okun's lower limit of 6. But Friedman also counts

unemployment predicted for the years 1983—88, which totals three times
                             —6—

as much as that for 1980—82, giving him a final value of 10—12 ("toward

the pessimistic end of Okun's range") for the episode's sacrifice

ratio. In a more recent look at the episode, furthermore, Friedman

(1984) was able to use actual data for most of 1983. This brought the

sacrifice ratio up to the 5—6 range without reliance on predictions of

future unemployment.

     Basically the same raw data has also been examined by.Fischer

(1984). As a result of a slightly different assumption regarding the

natural unemployment rate (6.5% vs. Friedman's 6.0), and a different

set of predictions about unemployment in 1984—1988, Fischer finds "a

sacrifice ratio around 5 to 6, at the lower end of the range quoted by

Okun," (1984, p. 27). If, moreover, the inflation drop is viewed as

6%, rather than 5%, then the implied sacrifice ratio is below the Okun

range.

     Perry's (1983) study of the recent episode is based in part on a

comparison of actual nominal wage changes during 1980.1—1983.2 with

values predicted by an equation estimated on data from the period

1954.1—1980.1. Evidence in favor of the credibility effect would

consist of negative prediction errors, i.e., actual minus predicted

values of the rate of wage change. In his evaluation of the results,

Perry emphasizes that such errors do not show up in 1980 or the first

three quarters of 1981, and that those resulting for 1981.4—1983.2 are

not large compared to their standard errors. It is the case, neverthe-

less, that the prediction errors are negative for each of the last

seven quarters that he examined, 1981.4—1983.2. This finding, which

is duplicated for the DRI model's wage equation in a study by Blanchard

(1984), is qualitatively consistent with the credibility hypothesis.
                                —7—


     Perry   (1983) also reports that price—change prediction errors are

predominately positive, rather than negative, for two of three versions

of the Gordon—King (1982)   inflation   equation. Thus from this equation

"there is no evidence supporting the credibility hypothesis in connection

with the present policy of disinflation" (Perry, 1983, pp. 598—9). A

similar finding is reported by Clarida and Friedman (1983).'

     What should we make of all of this? Certainly there is not a

great deal of evidence in the quarterly data for 1980—83 that would

serve to change the mind of someone dubious about the credibility

hypothesis or, for that matter, the Phillips—curve applicability of

the Lucas critique. But likewise the record is not such that a true

believer——even a relatively open—minded one——would be strongly inclined

to alter his position. A leading reason is noted by Perry (1983,

p. 600): "No measure exists of what private decisionmakers thought

about policy aims in this period. Because of this, one could argue

that the promised benefits of credible disinflationary policy have not

been realized because the credibility of anti—inflation policy has

never been established." My own opinion gives a great deal of weight

to this argument. Some reasons for doubting the Fed's resolve to

eradicate inflation can be inferred by consideration of Herb Stein's

(1980) list of six features that a disinflationary policy should

possess in order to be credible. These include:

  (i) a combination of various policy measures

 (ii) cooperation between the president and the Fed

(iii) a high degree of bipartisan support

 (iv) quantitative specification of intermediate—term goals and

      measures, so that deviation.., from the program will be
                                       —8—


            immediately    visible

     (u)    rejection   of any commitment about the unemployment rate

 (vi) rejection of substitute measures such as tIincomes policy".

Among these features, only (vi) in fact obtained during the episode in

question. Of particular importance, in my opinion, was the absence of

feature (iv), about which more will be said below.

           Indeed, from an ex         perspective as of June 1984 it is not at

all    clear that the episode of 1980—82 did in fact involve a change to
a new,      non—inflationary policy regime. Neither private nor govern-

mental forecasts are now predicting a continued lowering of the

inflation rate from its 1983 level, and some vector autoregression

models are predicting sharp increases within a few months. More

fundamental is the evidence concerning policy provided by the behavior

of the monetary base. In particular, the growth rate of the (St. Louis)

base has averaged 8.4% per annum since the third quarter of 1979, as

compared with 2.8% for the 21—year period 1947.4—1969.4.

           Examination of one particular episode is, of course, not the

preferred method of testing hypotheses. Standard econometric tech-

niques utilize data from longer sample periods and so are less suscep-

tible to distortion by one or two random disturbances. Thus a preferable

approach to the issue at hand would be a more general consideration of

the empirical significance of the credibility hypothesis/Lucas critique.

In    this    respect it   is   notable that Gordon (1984, p. 42)   has   contended

that "the U.S. Phillips curve appears to be one of the most stable

empirical macroeconomic relationships of the postwar era, one that

shows no sign as yet of being subject to Lucas's econometric critique."

This conclusion is based in part on the study by Gordon and King
 (1982, pp. 224—9), who find only minor evidence of any parameter

change between subsamples divided at the end of 1966.

     Since whether one finds evidence of relationship changes will

depend on the way in which he looks, I will report the results of a

brief investigation of my own. One consideration of importance is

that evidence of a parameter change will assert itself more clearly

when the alternative hypothesis——alternative, that is, to a null

hypothesis     representing no parameter change——Is not excessively
general. From the analysis of Sargent (1971), one would expect that
the place to look for changes in a Phillips relationship is in the
value of the coefficients attached to past inflation rates. Accord—

ingly, I   have looked for changes in the values of b1 , ... , bN               in

equations of the form

           =        +                                    +
               a0       aix   +

where x denotes the U.S. unemployment rate for males over 20 years of

age and with Pt measured as the log of the PCE deflator. I have

sought to determine whether the b, values changed between the non-

inflationary 1950ts and the inflationary 197015 by expressing each of

these coefficients as b. = b.            b. d ,          where d is a dummy variable
                                     O +jit                     t

equally zero in the earlier period and 1.0 in the later period.                  I

have followed Gordon and King (1982) in using the end of 1966 as the

breakpoint for d. My overall sample period is 1954.1 — 1982.4;

seasonally adjusted quarterly observations are used.

     Since the quarterly inflation rate was, over the early part of

the sample, fairly well—represented as a first—order autoregression

(see Nelson (1972)), let us first consider OLS estimates with N = 1.

With the dummy excluded we obtain
                                           — 10 —

where SEE is the sum of squared residuals and the figures in parentheses

are absolute values of t ratios. Including the dummy——allowing the

coefficient on              to     be different from 1966—-gives rise to the

following:

                          .OOO7x

                                                          +       .23Op       1
                                                                                      +   .566dp   1

    R2 = .791             SSE = .00124                         DW = 2.17


Obviously the dummy variable is highly significant; indeed, it carries

most of the explanatory power. Other aspects of the results are not,

however, satisfactory——e.g., the unemployment variables have little

explanatory power. Consequently, it appears that a larger value of N

is needed——that more lagged values of                              are required to reflect the

effect of past inflation.

     Estimates with N = 4 indicate that the fourth lag is not important

so results will be reported for N = 3.                        With the inclusion of the

post—1966 dummies, these estimates are

Without the dummy terms, the SSE value is .001232. Consequently, the

relevant chi—square test statistic has the value [(.001232/.001078)—1]
                                  11 —


[120—9] = 15.9.    As there are three constraints under the null hypothesis,

the critical value for a test with significance level 0.01 is 11.3.

The null hypothesis of no parameter change is therefore easily rejected.

     Furthermore, it will be noted that the sum of the b. values is

.913 for the post—1966 subperiod and only .582 for the earlier subperiod.

These numbers would suggest very different pictures concerning the

extent of an inflation—unemployment tradeoff across inflationary

steady states to someone who (incorrectly, in my opinion) believed

that the estimates could be interpreted in this fashion.

     While the foregoing investigation is certainly not a definitive

study, its results illustrate that the Gordon—King finding is sensitive

to the testing strategy employed. To conclude that Phillips relation-

ships are not susceptible to the Lucas critique, and thus that the

credibility hypothesis is invalid, seems premature at best. We

continue the discussion, then, under the presumption that expecta—

tional effects are important in relationships describing output/in-

flation tradeoff

III.    Reasons for Credibility Problems

       Our next topic concerns reasons why credibility tends to be low.

At this point the intention is to discuss the issue at a general and




rJ-
slightly abstract level, turning later (in Section IV) to specifics

concerning the United States. The discussion will be somewhat specific

even here, however, in that its emphasis will be on the tendency of

inflation rates——and agents' expectations of them——to exceed values

r1   nnø, ril   iriiriro,1 vy              ,,4-1-,,-s.-4l-.,

       Among studies designed to explain policy behavior of the monetary

authority, the most prominent analysis relating to the subject at hand

is that presented by Barro and Gordon (1983a)(1983b), who built upon

insights originally developed by Kydland and Prescott (1977). In the

simplest version of the Barro—Gordon (1983b) model, the monetary

authority's objective function is increasing in the current inflation

or monetary surprise, but decreasing in the square of the inflation or

money—growth rate itself, with discounted values of similar terms for

all future periods.' If this authority were to adopt a policy rule

that chose among constant inflation rates,21 he would recognize that

on average surprise values would be zero so that the optimal choice

would be for a zero inflation rate. For the same sort of reason, an

average inflation rate of zero would be implied by the optimal rule

choice when a broader class of rules is permitted.

       Suppose, however, that there exists no mechanism for institutional-

izing a policy rule, so that the authority proceeds in a discretionary

manner, selecting current inflation rates on a period—by—period basis.

In each period, then, he will take the prevailing expected inflation

rate as a given piece of data (an initial condition). The current
                               — 13 —


surprise   value then appears to be under his control, so the optimum

choice of the current inflation rate seems to be that which just

balances the marginal benefit of surprise inflation against the

marginal cost of inflation pse. With an objective function of the

type described, this optimal value will be strictly positive, with a

magnitude that is greater the lower is the cost assigned to inflation.

     Rational individuals understand this process, however, so the

public's expectations about actual inflation are correct on average.

Thus the surprise magnitude is zero on average, over any large number

of periods, even though the monetary authority views it as controllable

in each period. Consequently, there is on average no benefit actually

materializing to compensate for the cost of a positive inflation rate.

The discretionary outcome, it is clear, features more inflation but

the same amount of surprise inflation (on average) as under a rule.

According to this model, then, a discretionary mode of policy behavior

by the monetary authority leads to consequences that are unambiguously

poorer than would obtain (for the same economy and same objectives)

under rule—like behavior.

     Credibility enters the picture when Barro and Gordon enrich the

menu of policy considerations to reflect the possibility of reputa—

tional strategies. In a reputational equilibrium, the monetary

authority delivers a preannounced inflation rate in each period even

though this rate is below the value that would obtain under discre-

tionary behavior, the reason being that any departure from the pre—

announced value would induce private agents to disbelieve announce-

ments concerning the future and expect more inflation than promised.

Under the Barro—Gordon assumptions regarding the policymaker's
                                — 14 —


 objectives   this rate lies between zero and the discretionary value

 discussed above. Thus in each period the monetary authority partially

bypasses the apparent possibility of exploiting given expectations

because of his recognition that such exploitation would lead to a loss

of credibility (reputation) that would imply a more unfavorable

tradeoff in the future. Taking account of these reputational effects,

Barro and Gordon then obtain an equilibrium solution that is a weighted

average of those that would obtain under discretion and under the

optimum institutionalized rule. A concern for credibility is helpful,

but is not a fully adequate substitute for the possibility of an

institutionalized rule.

     The Barro—Gordon line of analysis accurately reflects, in my

opinion, several crucial aspects of the situation that actually

obtains in the U.S. economy. In particular, its emphasis on the

tension created by the desirability of money growth surprises together

with the undesirability of anticipated money growth, seems central to

the policy problem. It provides, moreover, an explanation of why our

economy experiences significantly positive inflation on average even

though policymakers (as well as economists) profess to believe that no

benefits are thereby Induced.

     Taylor (1983b) has expressed reservations about this aspect of

the Barro—Gordon analysis. His argument is that, in other contexts

involving similar tensions, "society seems to have found ways to

institute the optimal (cooperative) policy. For example, patent laws

are not repealed each year to prevent holders of patents from creating

monopolist inefficiencies [which] would eliminate any incentive for

future inventions" (1983b, p. 125). That argument seems unconvincing,
                               — 15 —


however, for the Barro—Gordon analysis is designed for an economy with

fiat money and our system has only recently completed its dissociation

from a commodity—money (gold) standard. Thus it should be possible,

if Taylor were right, to point to the recent creation of some institu-

tional arrangement comparable to our patent system. Indeed, the need

for something of this type would seem to be the main mssage of the

Barro—Gordon analysis. This argument of Taylor's seems to imply,

moreover, that our system has been generating the optimal amount of

inflation——which he disputes elsewhere (1985).

     My own reservations would be just the opposite of Taylor's.

Specifically, I would think that the actual situation in the U.S.

would be better represented by the purely discretionary equilibrium,

in the Barro—Gordon model, than by the reputational equilibrium.

Establishment of the latter apparently requires specification by the

policy-maker of a (non—institutionalized) rule governing preannounce—

ments that is "enforced't by the cost of departing from its instructions.

(See Barro—Gordon, 1983b, p. 108.) But there is no existing counter-

part of this rule in the U.S. system. Indeed, spokesmen for the

Federal Reserve have been adamant in their rejection of any prespecified

pattern of policy behavior and in their assertions concerning the

desirability (or even "necessity") of policy—making flexibility.121

In addition, I am bothered by the assumption about expectations that

is utilized by Barro and Gordon (1983b, p. 108).

     More recently, Cukierman and Meltzer (1984) have enriched the

aforementioned line of analysis by incorporating three complications

not present in the basic Barro—Gordon framework: imperfect control

of, and unreliable announcements about, money growth rates plus
                               — 16 —


stochastically   changing objectives of the policymaker. The      fluc-
tuations in objectives, moreover, are not promptly recognized by the

public. These extra ingredients permit Cukierman and Meltzer to

derive a large number of interesting conclusions concerning monetary

behavior; two examples are that the monetary authority will choose to

have relatively looser control procedures the higher is his rate of

time preference and that looser control leads to higher average rates

enrichments, however, the basic source of an excessive average inflation
rate continues to be the exercise of period—by—period discretion,

rather than the one—time choice of a ruie)!i

     A point emphasized in the Barro—Gordon discussions is the com-

patibility of fixed rules with policy activism, i.e., responses to the

current state of the economy. The distinction between rules and

discretion is quite different from the distinction between activist

(i.e., contingent) and non—activist (e.g., constant growth rate)

rules. Canzoneri (1983), by contrast, has tied together the two

distinctions by positing an environment in which desirable activist

responses depend upon a state variable about which the monetary

authority has private information (i.e., one not currently observable

by individual agents). This makes it impossible for agents to verify,

in a given period, whether the current rate of money growth differs

from its average value because of an activist, rule—dictated response

to current perceptions, or because the monetary authority is attempting

to exploit initial conditions as in a discretionary equilibrium. But

while that point is correct as stated, it does not imply that from a

series of observations the public (i.e., individual agents) cannot
                                      17 —


tell   whether the monetary authority is following a rule or behaving

discretionarily, for the    average   money growth rates will differ.

Consequently, the difference between the two distinctions remains

important, despite CanzoneriVs example.

       The main messages that I see in all of this are, then, those

stressed by Barro and Gordon. They are that (1) discretionary behavior

tends to lead to excessive inflation and (ii) the operation of rules

does not preclude activist stabilization responses. Reputational

considerations may move the outcome in the direction of an optimal

rule equilibrium, but will do so to a limited extent. What is needed

to prevent excessive inflation, and expectations of the same, is the

adoption of an appropriate policy rule.

       It may be noted that the undesirably—high inflation rates in

discretionary equilibria in the Barro—Gordon framework do not neces-

sarily correspond to imperfect credibility as defined in Section I,

that is, as existing when there is a divergence between privately

expected and actual or officially announced values, There is, however,

an interpretation of the discretionary equilibrium path that matches

the second of these definitions precisely. Suppose that in period t

the monetary authority takes Et              as given, but that he recognizes

that future surprises have expected values of zero. Thus in period t

he chooses      > 0 and plans                         =   ... = 0.   Then when

period t+1 comes around, the relevant initial condition is that

EtLPt+i is given, so the authority chooses ip41 > 0 and plans
       =
           t÷3 =     = 0.   In each period, according to this story, the

monetary authority takes actions that differ from those that he

planned (last period) to take. Then if his announcements accurately
                                        — 18 —


represent   his plans, the 2quilibrium will be one in which inflation in

each period——or more generally, on average——exceeds its previously

planned and announced value. Rational private agents' expectations

will (on average) equal actual values, so will be different from

planned and announced values——a situation of low credibility.

     To this picture it may be objected that the policymaker is

posited as behaving in a peculiar manner. In particular, h.e is not

future.   Dynamic inconsistency thus prevails in a different sense than

that described by Barro and Gordon (1983a, p. 599). This objection is

well taken, but on behalf of the story (equilibrium concept) offered,

it can be said that it describes a process in which outcomes are

consistently less desirable than those planned and announced by policy

authorities. In particular, there is in the example at hand more than

zero inflation on average even though the monetary authority is always

planning and announcing that the inflation rate will be zero in the

future. It seems possible that this story has some relevance for

actual economies.-L1 It certainly conforms in several respects——

target misses, base drift, positive inflation——to the portrayal of the

U. S. experience as described by Hetzel (1984c), Lombra—Moran (1980),

and other knowledgeable observers.

 IY.    Macro Policy Credibility in the United States

        In this section we turn our attention more specifically to the

 United States and, in particular, to its monetary authority, the

 Federal Reserve. In a discussion concerning credibility, the first

 thing that needs to be said about the Fed is that it appears, from the

 viewpoint of an outside observer, that the Fed has no desire for a

 situation of high credibility. Of course it would prefer for the

 public to expect that future inflation rates will be low. But, as

 Section I emphasized, that is not the same as desiring a   high degree
of conformity in general between public beliefs about policy and the

Fed's own plans.

       There are various ways in which the Fed's actions and procedures

suggest the absence of a desire for public understanding of the

policies being pursued. One obvious example in this regard was the

Fed's opposition in the 1970's to Congressional proposals for the

announcement of monetary targets. Of continuing significance, more-

over, is the practice of announcing target ranges——with quite wide

bands——for a number of different monetary aggregates. In addition,

there is the ambiguity concerning the meaning of these "targets"——are

they something that the Fed attempts to achieve or do the numbers

serve merely as indicators relevant to judgments about current con-

ditions?

       To these observations it might be countered that the Fed's

position is appropriate since it is undesirable to have targets

expressed in terms of monetary aggregates. The items of actual

concern are macroeconomic goal variables such as inflation, employ-

ment, output growth, etc. Thus it is undesirable for the Fed to try
                                20



to achieve announced monetary targets in the face of exogenous distur-

bances; instead, according to this argument, it should readily abandon

monetary targets when to do so would result in better fulfillment of

macroeconomic goals. Consequently, the argument concludes, the

ambiguity concerning monetary targets is not evidence of any lack of

desire to communicate actual goals. But if that is the position of

the Fed, then it should be happy to announce target paths for the goal

varIables, if it wants Its plans to be understood by the public. In

fact, of course, the Fed is on record as opposing the establishment of

publically—announced targets expressed in terms of goal variables)'

     The absence of a desire for credibility is also suggested by the

type of dialogue that often arises in response to criticism or sug-

gestions for procedural changes. For example, officials of the Fed

have frequently responded to criticism regarding money stock variability——

i.e., fluctuations in Ml growth rates——with the assertion that the Fed

is unable to exert control over the aggregate in question over short

spans of time. Almost simultaneously, other officials of the Fed have

argued in opposition to proposals for the adoption of operating

procedures that would serve to improve month—to—month monetary con—

trol.!J Then in response to the criticism that arises naturally from

this concatenation, it has been argued that "short run"   monetary
control is unimportant; as long as the money supply is well managed

over longer intervals there is no need (it is argued) for improved

month—to—month control. But that position is hard to reconcile with

the Fed's tendency to permit "base drift," i.e., its practice of

expressing each period's money stock target In terms of percent

changes from that period's starting value, without adjustments to
                                — 21 —


compensate for target misses of the previous period)—' Clearly, if

misses were white noise, this practice would lead to random—walk

behavior of money stock deviations from any given target path——which

is not what most economists would mean by "long run contro1,"' More

generally, long—run control under almost any definition requires

either accurate month—to—month control or an absence of base drift.

Thus it is difficult not to obtain the impression that the Fed places

lIttle value on iongrun monetary control——an attitude that sharply

contradicts the Fed's own statements about the relationship between

inflation and money growth together with its announced determination

not to contribute to inflation.-1"

       It might be possible to construct an argument that inflation (and

thus monetary control) is not actually of much importance,-1 but that

is not the issue under discussion. The point of the previous paragraph

is that the nature of the Fed's multipart response to its critics is

not of a type that would engender belief that the Fed is frankly

conveying a clear notion of its goals and intentions.-'

       As a result of the record of the last 15 years, many economists

have concluded that basic institutional reforms will be required to

create a high degree of credibility for premises that inflation will

not be permitted by the Fed in the future, The basic aim of the

proposed changes is, of course, to generate noninflationary behavior

of the monetary system as opposed to optimism unrelated to any changes

in the forces that have resulted in the inflation of the past. A

number of quite distinct proposals, representing different monetary

standards, have been presented. Prominent among there are proposals

for:
                               — 22 —




     (1)   adoption of a gold standard or some other commodity money

           system,

    (ii) passage of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced

           budget for the Federal government in each year,

   (iii) legislative imposition of a monetary rule upon the Fed, and

    (iv) conversion of the Fed into a bureau of the Treasury.

A complete consideration of these proposals is clearly beyond the

scope of this paper. But since each of the first three involves the

adoption of some form of a rule involving preconmiitment, discussion of

certain aspects is needed. More complete reviews have been provided

by Stein (1980) and Friedman (1984).

     The logical attraction of a genuine gold standard' is that it

makes the price level——i.e., the money price of commodities in general——

a relative price. There are then limits on the extent to which the

price level can change over any given span of time, limits that are

determined by changes in tastes and technology rather than the speed

with which paper money and bank deposits can be created. Thus it

seems almost certain that severe inflation could not occur while a

gold standard was in operation. The system does, however, permit

significant cyclical-fluctuations in the price level, corresponding to

relative price changes between gold and commoditIes in general. How

severe there fluctuations would be is a matter open to dispute, but

most students seem to believe that the magnitude could be troublesome.

Various writers have consequently proposed a monetary standard based

on a composite commodity bundle, rather than a bundle consisting of

gold alone. Hall (1982), for example, has suggested that a bundle

composed of ammonium nitrate, copper, aluminum, and plywood (in
                                 23 —


specified   quantities) would have rather small relative price changes——

relative to commodities in general——in the tinited States of the
              21/
present day.—

     A significant difficulty with a composite commodity system is

that a bundle such as Hall's would not possess the historically—based,

mystical attractiveness of gold. All arrangements concerning the

bundle would obviously be the product of explicit attempts consciously

to devise a desirable monetary system. But in the absence of the

mystique widely accorded gold, there would be little reason to prefer

a commodity money system in comparison to one based on fiat money.

Furthermore, if the commodity standard (i.e., the "dollar" price of

the bundle) were adjustable, as Hall proposes, a monetary authority

not bound by a rule would have the same type of incentive for discre-

tionary behavior as exists under our present system.-1

     It should also be mentioned that much of the apparent support for

a "gold standard" is probably based on distorted views of what such a

system entails. Friedman (1984, p. 45) has conjectured that a genuine

gold standard "has miniscule polItical support."

    Let us turn next to item (ii). While the notion of a constitu-

tional amendment provides an attractive route for possible institu-

tionalization of a non—discretionary policy rule, the emphasis that

has been given to balanced budgets seems slightly misplaced. An

example in a recent paper of mine (NcCallum, 1984b, pp. 130—1) illus-

trates that in principle an economy without excessive monetary growth

can avoid inflation even if it maintains a positive deficit that gives

rise to an ever—growing stock of government debt.' Strictly speaking,

this result requires rather extreme "Ricardian" assumptions involving
                                  — 24 —


infinite   planning horizons and lump—sum taxes. But one does not have

to believe in the literal empirical accuracy of these to accept the

point made by this example, which is that government purchases

(absorption of resources) and money creation——rather than deficits——

are the macroeconomic policy variables of primary importance. Conse-

quently, an amendment whose intent is to avoid excessive growth of

nominal aggregate demand should be designed to place limits on govern-

ment purchases (rather than taxation) and on money creation.

     One other point to be made about any amendment, whose purpose is

the establishment of a policy rule concerning fiscal variables, is

that it would be unfortunate if its design were to eliminate the

built—in automatic stabilizers provided by a tax system that relates

receipts to current income.—

     Closely related is the much—discussed possibility of congressional

imposition of a rule   that   would constrain and precommit the behavior
            25/
of the Fed.— The main reasons why such a rule should be beneficial

are implicit in the discussion of Section III; here the relevant issue

is whether there is any reason to expect that Congress would choose to

impose such a rule. In that regard, the analyses of Hetzel (1984a)

(1984b) and Kane (1982) are not encouraging. According to Hetzel,

discretionary period—by—period policy behavior results from an attempt

to appear responsive to the conflicting desires of various politically

significant groups, the intensity of whose desires fluctuates from

month to month and year to year. The effect of this hypothesis is

reinforced by Kane's "scapegoat theory" according to which members of

Congress want the Fed to have a substantial amount of discretion so

that each member can attempt to place blame on the Fed, ex post, for
                              — 25 —


unpopular developments. Each of these lines of reasoning seems to
suggest that the likelihood of Congress imposing an operationally

well—defined rule on the Fed is lower than the likelihood of the Fed

adopting such a rule of its own volition.

     Recently, Friedman (1983) (1984) has mentioned the possibility of

legislation that would "end the independence of the Fed by converting

it into a bureau of the Treasury Department" (1984, p. 43). He

         i-hr   h-i1
                ""——'— -h-f            -l1 i "i-
it would be a great improvement over the existing situation, even with
no other changes" (1984, p. 45). The basis for this judgement is that

bringing the Fed inside the administration would provide it with a

"bottom line" that would serve as a check on bureaucratic inertia that

prevents reform (1983, pp. 114—118). The bottom line in question

would, however, result from potential voter dissatisfaction rather

than the type of financial incentives faced by a private business

firm. In view of the type of performance that has been forthcoming

from Congress and recent administrations, it is not obvious that

better results would obtain. It would appear that the monetary

authority would, if placed in the Treasury, be faced somewhat more

directly with the same type of conflicting and fluctuating pressures

that it is now subject to indirectly. If such pressures are in fact

an important reason for discretionary behavior, this arrangement would

be unlikely to lead to improved performance. The case of the Bank of

Israel is relevant in this regard.

     Before concluding this discussion of proposed institutional

reforms, a few words should be added concerning one that has received

a great deal of attention recently, namely, that the Fed engage in
                                  — 26 —


"nominal GNP targeting."' This proposal has been discussed, both by
friends and foes, as if it were something dramatically different from

"money stock targeting." Consequently, I would like to suggest that

they are in fact highly similar. Some essential features of similarity

are as follows:

     (a) both assign the monetary authority an objective

          stated in terms   of   a single nominal variable

     (b) in both cases, this variable is not Itself an ultimate goal

          variable or an instrument that can be manipulated directly

          by the Fed

     (c) thus in both cases specification of the target does not

          amount to an operational rule

     (d) such a rule can be easily constructed, however, by

          specifying adjustments to the growth rate of the monetary

          base or the Fed's portfolio that would automatically take

          place whenever the GNP or money—stock variable is above or

          below its target path

     (e) for the avoidance of inflation, that target path needs to be

          defined in level (rather than growth rate) terms or,

          equivalently, base drift must be scrupulously avoided.

Of course the operating characteristics of a system based on nominal

GNP targets will be different from those of one based on Ni or M2

money supply targets. But, given institutional arrangements under

which the money stock is not directly controllable, this difference is

one of a technical nature that does not involve major issues of

principle or ideology. More important issues, in my opinion, involve
                              — 27


the presence vs. absence of operational rules for manipulating a

controllable instrument and the presence vs. absence of base drift.

V.   Conclusion

      It remains to bring together some of the diverse themes presented

above concerning credibility of monetary poiicy;-1-" an attempt will be

made here. In Section II it is maintained that evidence purporting to

contradict the validity of the credibility hypothesis——i.e., the

importance of expectations for output—inflation tradeoffs——is uncon-

vincing at best. Given the strong theoretical basis for this hypothesis

it then seems reasonable to base analysis involving macroeconomic

policy on specifications in which inflation—rate expectations play a

central role. In Section III the Barro—Gordon analysis, which builds

upon precisely this sort of a specification, is reviewed together with

elaborations and related arguments. The main message is that attempts

by the monetary authority to optimize on a discretionary period—by—

period basis tend to result in more inflation, and no less unemploy-

ment, than would prevail under a mode of operation that involves a

fixed (but perhaps activist) monetary rule. A successful anti—

inflationary policy would then seem to require the adoption of

rule—like behavior, the central feature of which is abstention from

attempts to exploit each period's historically—given initial conditions.

     A discouraging aspect of this conclusion, mentioned in Section

IV, is that discretionary behavior appears to reflect a response to

political pressures of a type that may impinge more directly upon

Congress and the executive branch than upon the Fed. Consequently, it

seems unlikely that steps to end period—by—period monetary policymaking

will be forthcoming from Congress or any part of the executive branch.

Nor does it seem likely that constitutional amendments of an effective

type can be relied upon.
                              — 29 —


     There are reasons for believing, then, that the best hope lies——

discouraging experiences notwithstanding——in the possibility of

adoption of something closer to rule—like behavior by the Fed itself.

In that regard, it should be noted that the Barro—Gordon analysis does

not imply that such an outcome is infeasible; it merely assumes that

discretionary or reputational equilibria will be established in the

absence of mechanisms for binding precommitments. But while the Fed

cannot literally precoumit ts future actions, it can adopt procedures

that would make departures from a preselected rule costly to itself.

If, for example, the Fed were to adopt an operational rule such as

that described by Hall (1984, p. 68) or McCallum (1984a, p. 39O),---"

then a host of activities and procedures involving rapid and accurate

collection and processing of the requisite data would grow up and

become established. Public statements and lectures explaining the

benefits of the rule——and perhaps even the infeasibility of departing

from it——would be given by Board members, advisors, and System econo-

mists. Departures from the rule would come to require justification,

and proposals for departures would inflict embarrassment on those

individuals who made then. In time, the whole gamut of forces for

bureaucratic inertia emphasized by Friedman (1983) would come to work

on behalf of adherence to the rule.

    But would not this sort of behavIor deprive the Fed of the

political benefits of period—by—period discretionary policymaking

emphasized by Hetzel (1984b), namely, those obtained by appearing

responsive to the multiple, shifting objectives of various politIcally—

significant groups? There is of course some danger involved, but

there are also dangers associated with the attempt to be responsive.
                                  — 30 —


In   particular, there is the danger that the groups in question will

come to recognize that the Fed cannot deliver the desired outcomes.

Actions involving redistributions can help one group but only by

hurting others, while extra attention during one part of the business

cycle requires below—normal attention during other phases. Thus the

type of behavior under discussion produces only the appearance of

being responsive to all of the various interest groups.2'

independence of the Fed, i.e., its existence as an entity dictated to
by neither Congress nor the executive branch. In a democratic system

of government, the ultimate justification for this sort of independence

would seem to be based on the presumption that it will promote far-

sighted behavior,- modes of operation that avoid the pursuit of

transitory benefits that entail poorer performance on average over

long time spans. But the choice between discretionary and rule—like

behavior amounts to the choice between a way of doing business that is

always focussed on the immediate present and one that takes a longer

perspective. Discretionary behavior is then, on this view, fundamentally

inconsistent with the raison d'etre of an independent monetary authority.

The decision not to adopt rule—like procedures for monetary policy

constitutes, in other words, neglect of the Fed's institutional

mission, One would expect prolonged neglect of this type to lead to

public calls for institutional reform, a conclusion that derives some

support from the experience of the past few years.

1.    Here    > 0   and 0   X <   1   while y and    refer to logarithms of

actual   and "capacity" or "natural rate" values of aggregate output for
period t and Pt    the log of the aggregate price level. In equation
(1), Et lApt merely denotes the subjective expectation of    held at
the   end of period t—1. At various points, however, we will interpret

          as the conditional mathematical expectation E(.           where

       is an information set including realizations of all relevant

variables in periods t—1, t—2              In other words, we shall in that

case be assuming rational expectations. That hypothesis is neither

necessary nor sufficient for the credibility hypothesis, although

there are strong relationships and many proponents of the credibility

hypothesis do in fact come to the latter by way of rational

expectations.


2. This statement is phrased so as to avoid taking a position on the

issue of whether costs are incurred whenever                 Thus this paper

continues in the common tradition of bypassing this fundamental and

important issue.


3. Note that the "credibility hypothesis" does not imply only that

policy credibility (as defined above) obtains, but also that the

economy's Phillips curve is of the expectational variety. This

terminology is taken from Fellner.


4. An entirely different argument calling into question the

hypothesis was developed by Grossman (1983). This argument concerns

equation (1) together with rational expectations [i.e., with Et               =

                a specification that has often been interpreted as
 applying to an economy with full price flexibility. Under that

 interpretation, as Grossman notes, the true structural supply function

 (as developed in Lucas (1973)) related to contemporaneous pception

 errors rather than anticipational errors; equation (1) is just an

 aggregated reduced—form expression that is appropriate in some cases.

 Consequently, if individuals possess useful information on

 contemporaneous nominal aggregates (money stock or price index

 values), as would seem to be the case in actuality, then

 previously—formed expectations of     are irrelevant for output

 determination. Credibility then becomes unimportant for price and

output developments; all that matters is the path actually taken by

the money stock and price level. So, Grossman in effect suggests,

credibility arguments are important only for economies in which there

is some stickiness in price adjustments. McCallum (1982) uses a

related argument to suggest that price stickiness is in fact a feature

of the U.S. economy.


5. The sacrifice ratio is the percent of a year's output lost divided

by the number of percentage points (on an annual basis) that the

inflation rate falls. The term was used by Gordon and King (1982).


6. Other studies of the episode have been conducted by Cagan and

Feliner (1983) and Englander and Los (1983).



7.   At the Jackson Hole conference, Robert Gordon reported some test

statistics indicating that the difference between my results and those

of Gordon—King arises primarily because my specification (3) does not
include a number of additional explanatory variables that do appear in

the Gordon—King study (1982, p. 218), One's conclusions concerning

the relative merits of the tests must then rest, to a considerable

extent, on his judgment as to the theoretical appropriateness of the

inclusion of these additional variables.


8. Other versions of the model exist. The square of actual inflation

relative to some constant target rate appears in one, while Barro and

Gordon (1983a) use the square of y —       (with   k > 1) as a penalty

term rather than making the objective increasing in      —     (or   the

surprise term).


9. There is no need, in the Barro-Gordon setup, to distinguish

between inflation and money—growth rates. Consequently, we shall for

simplicity write as if the authority were directly selecting inflation

values.


10. See, for example, the statements in Voleker (1982)(1984). Also

see the discussions of the Fed's attitude by Hetzel (1984a) and Lombra

and Moran (1980).


11. Cukierman and Meltzer (1983, pp. 34—5) suggest that their

framework does not involve any dynamic inconsistency "because the

'action' taken by the public [forming expectations of money growth]

does not depend on the future settings" of policy variables. As the

same expectation formation is the public's only "action" in the

Barro—Gordon and Kydland—Prescott setups, these must also involve no

dynamic inconsistency in this sense. A different concept of dynamic

inconsistency might define the latter as obtaing when there exists a
 discrepancy between instrument settings under rules and under

 period—by—period decision making (given the same preferences and

 technological constraints in each case). This sort of discrepancy

would prevail in the Cukierman—Melczer framework, if rules were

considered.


12. It is my opinion not obvious that it is wrong to assign a

different extent of rationality to private agents, whose modelled

actions impinge primarily on their own welfare, and policy

authorities, whose modelled actions impinge primarily on others. To

treat such actions differently is to admit to having a poor model of

the political process——something that I am willing to do——for, with a

good one, policymakers could simply be treated as maximizing their own

private individual utility subject to the constraints of the political

process.


13. See, e.g., Volcker (1983).


14. Especially relevant in this regard was the Fed's long—lasting

opposition to contemporaneous reserve requirements. One of the

reasons given for the Fed's reluctance to change——viz., the possible

technical infeasibility of banks' compliance with contemporaneous

requirements——was itself enough to give one doubts about the candor of

the position (given that such requirements prevailed before 1968). As

a climax to the matter, when the Fed finally introduced in 1984 a

scheme that it describes as contemporaneous reserve requirements, it

chose one that continues to feature a two—day lag between the end of

computation and maintenance periods. As Goodfriend (1984) has

explained, this two—day lag could——depending on whether the Fed
stabilizes the Federal funds rate during the two days——make the system

no different for monetary control purposes than others previously

found wanting.


15. From 1975 to 1978, base drift could occur every quarter; since

the passage of Humphrey—Hawkins legislation in 1978 it occurs once

each year, with a second occasion possible (and realized in 1983).


16. Barro (fl82. p. 105') refers to   this     type of regime as "one   that
possesses no nominal anchor."


17. See, e.g., Voicker (1984).


18.   I would not try to do so.


19. Another indication is provided by the Fed's opposition to the

prompt release of trading—desk directives and minutes of FOMC

meetings.


20. Friedman's (1961) (1984) distinction between "real" and "pseudo"

gold standards is somewhat unclear. It has been summarized by Stein

(1980, p. 63) as follows: a real gold standard is a condition in

which gold and promises to pay gold are circulated and exchanged

freely but in which the government does not peg the price of gold

relative to the national currency.     .   .   In   a pseudo—gold standard,

the government fixes the price of gold by standing ready to buy or

sell. .   . ." It would seem that the existence of a national currency
with a pegged gold price would constitute a genuine gold standard

provided that this price is maintained permanently. The gold standard

then amounts to a rule governing the behavior of currency issues, one
that subordinates the currency in a way that makes it consist of

"promises to pay gold." Aid in understanding Friedman's point is

provided by a useful paper by Cagan (1982), which describes the forces

for management of actual gold—standard systems in a discretionary

manner. Cagan also describes the influences that tend to bring about

the breakdown of such systems.


21. Hall's paper includes the unorthodox contention that a government

purchases and sales of the bundle would be unnecessary and

undesirable. I will not attempt to consider that suggestion here.


22. These problems are recognized by Hall (1982, p. 112): "The

commodity standard is not inherently superior to fiat money as a way

to stabilize the cost of living."


23. The example is of some theoretical significance because it occurs

in the context of a general equilibrium model in which all agents

maximize explicitly specified objective functions and all markets

clear.


24. This concern would be unnecessary if the economy were perfectly

Ricardian. The viewpoint being taken is that the Ricardian model

provides a good starting point for analysis of macroeconomic

phenomena, but that its conditions are unlikely to obtain in full.


25. Also possible is a constitutional amendment restricting monetary

behavior (Friedman, 1984, pp. 41—2).


26. See, e.g., Cordon (1983), Hall (1984), and Taylor (1985). The

scheme described in McCallum (1984a) uses nominal GNP target
departures as input variables to a fixed but semi—activist rule

prescribing growth of the monetary base.


27. Certain portions of the discussion——e.g., Sections I and Il——are

equally applicable to a discussion of the credibility of fiscal

policy. The model of Section III would not, however, appear to be

appropriate for such a discussion. Issues involving the interaction

of monetary and fiscal policy have been recently discussed by Blinder

(1982).


28. It is crucial in this regard that the rule be operational, i.e.,

specified in terms of a controllable instrument variable, in order to

minimize possible self—deception. Adoption of an (intermediate)

target variable, be it Ml or nominal GNP, does not constitute adoption

of a rule.


29. Another problem with Hetzel's argument is that it seems to

presume that rules must be of a non—reactive type, i.e., unresponsive

to current conditions. Thus he says: "The requirement of balancing

multiple goals among which priorities change. .    . creates   the demand

for flexibility, and absence of precommitment" (1984b, p. 18).


30. Volcker (1983) refers to the "independent status of the Federal

Reserve that makes a longer—term view possible."
