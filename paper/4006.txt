                                          ABSTRACT



       This paper discusses the regressive nature of the inflation tax and she limited extent of

its impact on those individuals below the poverty line. It also argues that inflation affects

poverty mainly through its impact on real wages: the empirical evidence shows that wages

increase more slowly than prices during episodes of rising inflation in Latin America. Finally

the paper discusses whether sonic stabilization programs are less costly in Lenns of increased

poverty than others Both orthodox programs and attempts to reduce inflacinn by the

implementation of incomes policy have not helped the poor in LatIn America.

                     This paper discusses the impact of inflation on

redistribution and poverty. It focuses on the regressive nature of the

inflation tax and the limited extent of its impact on those individuals

below the poverty line. Although the inflation tax does not effeot those

individuals below the poverty line due to their negligible average cash

holdings, it may wipe out the savings of the middle class and increase the

number of poor. In this sense it widens inequality of income and increases

poverty.

                     It also argues that inflation affects poverty mainly

through its impact on real wages because nominal wages fail to increase as

fast as prices in episodes of rising inflation rates. In the context of

full employment there is no satisfactory explanation for partial

indexation, but the empirical evidence shows that perfect indexation does

not exist and that wages increase more slowly than prices during episodes

of high inflation.

                     Finally it explores the impact on poverty of

stabilization programs and discusses whether some programs are less costly

in terms of increased poverty than othera. Both orthodox programs and

attempts to reduce inflation by the implementation of incomes polity in

Latin America have not helped the poor.

DOES INFlATION MATTER?

                    Bouts of inflation in the 198Dm have revived

economists' interest in populism. The recent literature1 stresses the

repeated willingness of Latin American regimes to push demand beyond

economic constraints in an effort to improve the lot of all income groups

simultaneously. The result is a set of unsustainable macroeconomic

policies and the collapse of the economy. Workers wind up worse off than

they were at the beginning of the populist period, but even before the

collapse, inflation acceleration erodes real incomes.

                    Inflation increases poverty in two ways. First, the

inflation tax can reduce dispomable income. Second, if nominal wegea

increase less than the price of goods consumed by wsge earners, workers'

real income will decline.

                    This section uses Brazilian data to define and

illustrate the inflation tax and to discuss its regressive effects.Then I

move the focus to the impact of rising inflation rates on wages.



The Inflation Tax

The share of the inflation tax in GOP is defined as:




(1)                      ft
                              —
                                  [a/(l+a)]   (h/y)


where h is the average between the monetary base of the current and the

previous December; y is COP, and a is the inflation race.
                                              4




                        To calculate the inflation tax we need to know the

amount of real balances people hold. Figure 1 shows the ratio of the

monetary base2 to COP in Brazil between 1970 and 1990.. In 1970, after many

years of inflation, thia ratio was already low in comparison to other

countries. But as inflation continued to increase, the monetary base/COP

ratio declined further. By 1985, the monetary baae was equivalent to 2

percent of COP. The fitted line in figure 1 (Period: 1970-1990, t-

stetiatica in parentheses) is:




(2)        1og(h/y) —    -1.4    -   0.18 log l!t + 0.42 1og(h/y).1 + (0.58) dunimy
                                (-   3.46)        (2.84)                (4.71)



      — 0.94; I useone dummy variable for the expected March 1990 Collor

Plan which froze monetary assets in the banks: it is zero in all years

except in 1989 and l990.

                        Figure 2 shows the inflation tax in Brazil. The fitted

line waa calculated by using the money demand equation estimated in (1).

The ehape of the curve which describes the inflation tax in relation to

the inflation rate depends on how fast people react to an increase in

inflation hy reducing their real cash balances, In the short run, this

reaction is captured by the coefficient of the inflation rate in equation

(1), which I call o. In the long run it           is   calculated as a/(l-Ø), where

ia the coefficient of the lagged money/income variable, In the case of

Brazil the long run elasticity of demand for the real monetary hase in
                                         S




relation to inflation is 0.4, that is, the ratio of the monetary base to

income declinea by 40 percent when inflation increases by 100 percent.

                    Figure 3 shows how the inflation tax differs depending

on the elaaticity of demand for real cash balances. The inflation tax also

depends on the amount of teal cash balances people want to hold when there

is no inflation as illustrated in figure 4.

                    Two implications follow from this analysis. First,

countries with the same inflation will exhibit different inflation tax

revenues, depending on their money demand functiona. Table 1 shows

seigniorage4 as a share of GOP and inflation rates for selected Latin

American countries. Second, different groups within a country will pay an

inflation tax which will erode different proportions of their income.



i-low Re&tessjve La the Inflation Tax?

The inflation tax is regressive because it wipes out the savings of the

middle-income classes. But those, who were already poor before inflation

started, pay an insignificant amount of their income as an inflation tax,

How auth income does the poorest quintile of the population lose in the

form of an inflation tax? Almost nothing. The lowest quintile of the

population has no savings and aa long as they get paid weekly and the

inflation rate remains below 100 percent per year, the inflation tax will

amount to Less than 1 percent of their income, even if they spread their

expenditures evenly during the week. This is easy to show.
                                             6




                    Assuming that a worker has no assets, gets paid weekly,

and spreads his expenditures evenly during the week, his cash balances are

equal to one half of his weekly income, yb,, and the inflation tax he pays

weekly Is:



(3)                         Tw —   0.5   y

where: trw is the weekly inflation rate.

Since there are 52 weeks in one yesr, the ratio between the snnual

inflation tax sad ennual incose is:




(4)          52 [0.5 y.(rr/(l-iir))] / 52        y, —0.5


                     In general, as Inflation accelerates, the wage payment

period is reduced from once a nonth to once a week, and finally to daily

payments during periods of hyperinflation. Table 2 shows the inflation tax

as a share of income under the assumption that workers get paid monthly

(column 4) or   weekly   (column 5) and spread their expenditures evenly

during the period between payments.

                     As inflatic6 increases, workers purchase virtually all

their neceasitiea as soon as they get paid, keeping enough cash fcr

transportation if they csnnot get their bus passes in advance. Table 3

shows what happens when they spend half their income on the day they get

paid and the other half evenly during the rest of the period.
                                     7




                   Assuming that the inflation race is 20 percent per

year, that workers get paid monthly, and that they spread their payments

evenly during the month, workers would pay 0.75 percent of their annual

income aa an inflation tax. If inflation increases to 100 percent per year

without any institutional changes the tax would increase to 2.8 percent of

annual inoome. But if payments were changed to a weekly basis and workers

changed their spending habits to those shown in table 3, the inflation tax

would decline to 0,3 percent of income. When inflation reaches 1,000

percent per year, life gets tougher. Even with weekly payments and a

ohenge in spending habita, the inflation tax tan eat 1 percent of workers'

incomes. But this is peanuts compared to the decline they experience in

their real wages, as will be discussed later.

                   Table 4 illustrates this argument by showing numbers

for inflation, the share of the monetary base in SOP, and the inflation

tax in Brazil, Between 1970 and 19W, the inflation rate increased from 20

to 100 percent. In response to the increase in inflation, the demand for

real cash balances fell and the share of the real monetary base declined

from 8.2 percent of 00? to 4.6 percent, The inflation tax increased from

1.4 to 2.3 peroent of COP. Some income groups lost more than 2 percent of

their income in the fern of an inflation tax, while others lost less.

Wealthy citizens who reacted fast to inflation and had access to other

forms of assets such as indexed deposits may not have paid as much.

Neither did the very poor. The inflation tax paid by the lowest quintile

of the population increased but resained negligible.
                                                B




                      By 1990, inflation had increased to 2,700 percent and

the inflation tax paid by the poor as a share of their income had risen to

1.5 percent. Compared to other taxes, the inflation tax remained small.



Inflation and Real Wages

                      Inflation stabilization does not come without costs. It

is usually associated with a recession which generally means more

unemployment and lower real wages. But accelerating inflation also reduces

real wages and increases poverty. This second effect dominated the scene

in Latin America between 1977 and 1989.

                      Equation (5) was estimated using panel data for average

reel wages, average annual inflation rates, and average annual resl growth

rate, between 1977 and 1989, in seven Latin American countries (Argentina,

Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and uruguay) for which average

real wages are available for the whole period.5 The regression uees seven

country-dummies; w is real wage, s is inflation, and x is real GOP growth

rate per year.

and variable inflation rates, such as Argentina and Peru, and countriea

with relatively stable and low rates such ss Colombia. In many countries,

there are years during which real wages declined with inflation in

response to stabilization programs. But the effect of falling real wages

during periods of rising inflation totally dominates other influences.

According to equation (3), real wages fall by 14 percent when inflation

doubles, Figures 5-9 show episodes of rising inflation and declining real

wages in Argentina, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay.

                   The careful study of poverty in Argentina by Morley and

Alvarez (1991) confirms the importance of a decline in real wages as a

determinant of poverty growth in Argentina.6 The percentage of people in

poverty in Creater Buenos Aires increased from 6 percent in 1980 to 11

percent in 1986, and to 22 percent in 1989 (Table 5). Morley and Alvarez's

sectorsl and occupational decomposition of the aggregate poverty indices

in Table S show the rising headcount ratio within industry and occupation

of production workers. The authors conclude that in the 1989 Argentine

recession, poverty increased because real wsgee went down for working

people in both the formal and informal sector and in part also because

retirement incomes and transfers were inadequately indexed for inflation.

They do not find unemployment per se as a significant additional source of

poverty in the 1980s in Argentina.

                   The costs of inflation for wage earners also include

oscillations in their real income. Figure 10 shows the real minimum wage
                                    10




in Brazil, between 1975 and 1991, and it illustrates the shortcomings of

indexation. For individuals who are liquidity constrained, the significant

oscillation in their real wages means that they cannot smooth conauniption

or that their reel dispoable income will be eroded if they try to carry

cash from one month to the next.



THE IMPACT OF STABILIZATION ON POVERTY

                   Just as populism stands for the felse dream that growth

per capita can exceed productivity growth, the question as to whether the

poor suffer from edjuetment programs poses a misleading dilemma. Clearly

adjustment programs, which call for a reduction in government expenditures

end devaluations, reduce real income and increase unemployment in the

short run. But adjustment is unavoidable in most cases and the decline in

welfare observed during adjustment programs derives in good measure from

conditions that existed preceding these programs: declining terms of

trade, reduced external finance, increased debt service costs, and

unsustainable deficits.7 Nonetheless, one must ask whether some programs

are less costly in terms of increased poverty than others.

                    The answer to this question can be found by weighing

the costs of successful stabiliration programs which did not make use of

incomes policy compared with those which did. The answer may differ for

moderate versus high inflation stabilization.

                    Oornbusch and Fischer (1991) suggest that seigniorage

plays at most a modest role in the persistence of moderate inflations
                                       II




which are mainly explained by inertia. Such inflation can be reduced only

at a substantial short-term cost to growth. They examine four oases and

conclude that "there is unfortunately little encouragement in these case

studies for the view that an exchange rate commitment, or incomes Policy?

allows a country to move et low cost from moderate to low inflation. ,8

                   What can be concluded by comparing four oases of high

inflation atabilization? Chile in 1974-76 and Bolivia in 1985-56 are

exemples of countries that succeeded in bringing down inflation without

using incomes policy as a central policy instrument. Brazil in 1964-65 snd

Mexico in 1988-89 are examples of countries where inoomea policy was

successfully used to atop inflation.

                   Unemployment and poverty increased significantly in

Bolivia and Chile (Table 6) during the stabilization years, but both

programs coincided with s dramatic fall in these countries' terms of

trade, which in part explains the severity of the recessions and the

increase in poverty they suffered.

                   In Brezil (1965) and in Mexico (1988), although the

recession socompanying inflation stabilization was less pronounced than in

Chile (1974-75) and Bolivia (1985-86), there is no evidence that incomes

policy helped the poor. In Brazil, the concentration of income in the

l960s resulted largely from policies restraining nominal wages during the

mtabiiization program In Mexico, the mo-called social pact was only used

after five years of recession and a dramatic decline in real wages. The
                                    12




Mexican government has not yet made available the 1989 household income-

expenditure survey, but there is reason to suspect that the poor in 1989

were not eny better off than in 1984 (Table 7).

                   In Brazil (with incomes policy) end in Chile (without

incomes policy), stabilization wes forced on wage-earners by a military

dictatorship. In Bolivia (without incomes policy) and in Mexico (with

incomes policy), an elected government had clout over unions. In

dictatorships or democracies, with or without incomes policy, political

compromise is essential to balance budgets and stop high inflation.

Worlcers0 claims to higher wages have to be restrained; entrepreneurs have

to accept lower profita taxpayers have to beer additional obligations.

Moreover, even dictatorships must have the ability to develop institutions

for concerted action against inflation if their programs are to succeed.

In the four cases under discussion, stabilization was imposed by a

technocratic elite which had the support of important segments of society

end which was able to develop institutions to sustain disinflation.

                   Even in well conceived adjustment programs, the poor

are especially hard hit by the transition costs. the poor have less room

to cope with the radical policy moves which produce sectoral dislocation

of resources and eaployinent. Changes in relative prices, unemployment, and

reduction of social expenditures will hurt the poor. Incomes policies do

exist which, in principle, would help a more equitable stabilization

program, but the success of these policies requires that the government be
                                    13




accepted as legitimate by the relevant social actors and that organized

labor, industrialists, and politicians have a reaaonahly compatible

strategy.

                   Solutions which appear to be under government control

(such as the Austral Plan in Argentina or the Cruzado Plan in Brazil) but

lack macroeconomic consistency will fail. There is nothing worse for

poverty than failed stabilization programs that lead to rising inflation

and further recession. During the 1980s Argentina suffered from two

serious recessions interrupted in 1986 by a short and shallow recovery. By

the late 1980s recession and hyperinflation came together in a powerful

stagflation. Argentina, with only 6 percent of its population in poverty

in 1980, saw that number increase to 20 percent because of its erratic

macroeconomics (Table 5).

                   in Brazil, the same disastrous combination of inflaticn

and failed attempts at stabilization also led to no progresa on the fight

against poverty, table 8 shows the headcount, the normalized income gap,

foster, and Sen indices for Brazil between 1960 and 1988. The poverty line

is set at approximately one real minimum wage.9

                   The figures are telling, Between 1960 and 1970, the

headcount index shows that poverty in Brazil remained unchanged despite

annual income growth per capita in excess of 3 percent. The lack of

progress on the poverty front resulted from the worsening of income

distribution in the l960s: real wages of skilled labor increased while
                                     14




real wages of non-skilled labor fell. The decline in the real wages of the

poor was primarily a result of the rise in inflation before 1964 and of

the mid-1960s recesaionJ° The income share of the poorest 40 percent of

the population fell from 16 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1970. In

1970, approximately 40 percent of the population was poor.

                   During the 1970s, a period of rapid economic growth.

the headcount was reduced by nearly half, despite a further decline in the

share of income going to the poorest 40 percent of the population. It is

also notable that the Sen index in 1960 also fell to half of its value in

1970, The decline in the Sen index may derive from a large number of poor

moving above the poverty line and thua from a change in the weights of

poverty gaps and not from a reduction of disparity among the poor.

                   From 1981 to 1983, all poverty indices in Brazil

increased. Rocha (1990), Fox and Morley (1991), and Ravaillon and Datt

(1991) offer detailed studies of the relationship between the 1982-83

recession and the increase in poverty.

                   Having argued that inflation, stabilization, and

adjustment are costly. I must accept that the only consistent alternative

open to governments is the maintainance of conservative macroeconomic

policies. On these grounds, the Colombian example stands out.

                    The eclectic Colombian system used exchange controls

but avoided the extreme protectionism of other Latin American countries;

its crawling peg kept the exchange rate at reasonable levels and the
                                      15




government avoided inflationary finance. By stimulating housing

construction and exports other than coffee, Colombia experienced sustained

growth and avoided the spectacular crises found elsewhere in Latin

America. Long run data from the turn of the century to 1988 shows a

Kutneta-type of U-shaped curve for Colombia, with a sharp deterioration in

income equality up to the lPGOs and improvement since then The dominant

factors at work have been a shift of the lahor force from agriculture to

industry, broader access to fonsl education, and demographic changes.

Education's role in determining the distribution of income was perhapas

more important than macroeconomic policy. Evidence from the 197Cc also

indicates that the wsges of agricultural workers increased faster than

national income, while wages of lower-income urban workers graw faster

than wages of higher-income urban workers and salaries of white-collar

eaployees. At the same time, the tax system was slightly progressive in

the 196Cc, and vas more so after the reforms of 1974-75. The income of che

first decile was twice as high after taxes and government transfers, while

the income share of the top decile was reduced. A recent survey by the

Colombian Ministries of Planning end Agriculture shows thac the incidence

of povarty among rural families fell from 52 percent to 32 percent over

the period 1976-88.

                      in both the l970s and the 1980s, education, hesith, and

public services such as water, electricity, and welfare programs

substantially raised standards of living among low income families, During
                                    16




the period from 1973 to 1985, the share of rural households with access to

electricity rose from 15 to 41 percent, end rural illiteracy fell from 29

to 23 percent. Although rural income distribution remained strikingly

unequal as of 1958, the productivity gap between small farmers and large

producers had dramatically decreased as a result of government efforts to

channel resources for modernization into the cemoesino sector.

                   Liukaila (1991) estimates that the initial negative

impact of the adjustment program of 1985 was largely cushioned by action

on the minimum wage and by the exemption of food from the 8 percent import

surchage. By 1986, under the influence of the coffee boon, real wages had

recovered as had growth and employment.

                   Nonetheless, serious problems of poverty have persisted

throughout this period of sustained economic growth and social change.

Income distribution remains skewed with incomes of the top 20 percent of

households six to seven tines that of the bottom 20 percent. Moreover,

gains in the social indicators hide the sharp differences in health and

education among rich and poor. The predicament of landless peasants

remains unchanged, although it is overshadowed by the conditions of the

urban poor found in growing numbers in city slums.

                   ?rogress has been slow. The very poor cannot gain from

neutral growth because they start from a very small base. They need

poverty programs. Increased taxation might prove indispensable to finance

such programs, unless governments can rely on revenues from privatization,

Poverty Protrams

Given the extent of poverty in Latin   America any program will need to
combine policies that allow the poor to increase current consumption with

investment to generate future growth of their income. These policies must

consider the links among income, health, and education, and give special

emphasis to female education, given the evidence that women's education

has a strong positive effect in reducing fertility rates and reducing

child mortality)-2

                     A first step in undertaking poverty progams is to carry

out a household income-expenditure survey. These surveys already exist in

many Latin American countries and the World Bank's Living Standards

Measurement Study unit has quickly carried out surveys on personal

computers. Crootaert and Marchant (1991) provide guidelines for

identifying target groups and monitoring policy.

                     Second, one muat look for successful programs arid

determine their relevance to other countries and situations)-3 In Latin

America, which policy initiatives are known for efficient targeting and

competent delivery of social services? Are there successful emergency

programs after stabilization? Recent discussion has focused on programs

developed in Bolivia Mexico, and Chile.

Bolivia

In Bolivia, the econcmic crisis of the 1980s exacerbated deep-rooted

poverty problems and prompted che government to launch the Emergency
                                       18




Social Fund (ESF) to cushion the adverse effects of the 1985 stabilization

and adjustmant program. The ESF aimed at providing temporary employment

opportunities and bolstering basic social services, ma staff of the tSP

approved or rejected funds requested for small-scale, labor-intensive

projects that came from local governments or non-governmental agencies.

The ESF closed its operations on March 1991 with 3,269 projects (US$191

million) completed.

                      Newman et at, (1991) estimate that the sverage ESF

worker received a 32 percent increese in weekly earnings over what he

would have earned if- he were working in the absence of the ESF. The

demand-driven emergency program (the agency did not propose any projects

itself) helped lessen the hardships of unemployment during adjuetment.

This program also achieved notable success in establishing relationships

with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Nonetheless poverty

alleviation in Bolivia still requires greater effort and targeting. To

this end, the government started the Social Investment Fund in 1991.

Mexico

In response to che ].9B2 crisis, a restricti'e demand policy and sweeping

reforms took place in Mexico. Between 1982 end 1988 the cumulative growth

per capita was negative and the resl minimum wage fell by one-half, For

most of the l9BOs, social spending was held hostage to Mexico's dire

economic problems. Throughout the adjustment period, there was a

substantial deterioration in social conditions. Real per capita
                                     19




expenditures in the social sectors fell by about 7 percent per year, and

public investment in rural and regional development dropped by 80 to 90

percent in the 1980s.14 In the short-term, the decade long recession

combined with free-msrket reforms and cuts in social expenditures have

exacerbated Mexico's highly unequal income distribution.

                   President Carlos Salinas' answer was the Solidarity

Program (Prorrama Macional de Solidaridad, Pronasol), initiated in

December 1988, covering programs on health, education nutrition, housing,

employment, and infrastructure. The broad participation of the program's

beneficiaries is sought in setting priorities: the program sharply raises

the stake that villagers and townspeople have in the projects. Solidarity

pays for materials, but families who share a school or street oversee the

project as well as its budget, and build the project themselves with

technicsl advice. The program built almost 1,200 health centers in 1989-

91, paved roads, laid sewer lines, refurbished schools, instslled

drinking-water systems, and distributed rural credit. Its political impact

helped the ruling party to win mid-term elections in August 1991.

                   The ideas behind Solidarity coincided with the

decentralization of social services sponsored by foreign aid experts. The

World Bank will lend $350 million for a regional development program under

the auspices of Solidarity. The program targets the poor and indigenous

producers in the states of Chiapsa, Guerrero, Hidalgo, and Oaxsta. The

project has three components: investment, institutional developsent, and
                                     20




environmental and archeological site protection. Recently approved

projects on basic health? primary education, and nutrition complement the

regional investment programs. Migration from the poorest areas to growth

poles will continue to take place, but unlese those who leave have

acquired some human capital, they will just swell the number of unskilled

workere in the slums of the great cities. This is why the government

intends to provide special assistance to the underdeveloped states.

                   The social situation in Mexico is overshadowed by a

decade of dramatic decline. Only three years old, the Solidarity progrsm

has not been able to erase the scars left by the recession of the l9SOs.

But the substantially funded program is making its mark, even though it is

still too early to evaluate Solidarity's impact on poverty.

Chile

Recent social policies in Chile and their impact on poverty are

controversial. Not surprisingly the democratic opposition to the military

regime charged severe neglect on the social front, aggravating an already

poorly performing economy until 1984 In 1987, the percentage of Chileans

households in poverty had more than doubled from 6 percent in 1970 to more

than 13.5 percent in 1987 (Table 5). Income distribution inequality also

increased dramatically and the Cmi index was 0.63 in 1989.

                   Protagonists of the military regime, by contrast, show

evidence of improvement in living standards as measured by social

indicators. Reduction of infant mortality is extrsordinary in compsrison
                                    21




to other countries in Latin America, even if such achievement represents

the continuation of s long term trend (Figure 11).

                   The debate remains open. The questions surround two

issues. One is the interpretation of a renge of social indicators (Tables

5 and 9) The other is bow to understand the change in indicators: were

they driven by macroeconomic developments or by social policies?

                   Between 1974 end 1989, social policies targeted the

poor avoiding spill-oven to the middle class. Moreover, the private

sector was assigned an enhanced role in providing social services and an

effort was made to use market mechanisms in the distribution of services.

                   Castaneda (1991), a strong supporter of these reforms1

provides a carefuL explanation of the decentralization measurea undertaken

in education health, and housing. Chile also privatized its national

pension fund in 1981. Under the prior systea, workers, firms, and the

state paid into a common fund administered by the state. Benefits bore

little relationship to ccntributions, which failed to accumulate in value.

Under the new system, private firms collect payments, manage funds, and

supervise distributions. Pensions have increased markedly. At the same

time, payments to the disabled and to widows and orphans are more than

twice their previous level. Castaneda believes that overall the results of

the reforms were highly positive. He uses broad social indicators (such sa

the decline in infant mortality) to support this view.

                    Coleccion Escudios Cienlan (1991) and Mideplan (August

1991) develop the opposite view. They observe that government expenditures
                                    22




were cut. Even though the share of social expenditures in total

expenditures increased significantly, the share of social expenditures in

GD? remained barely constant (Table 10), The increase of this share in the

mid-l980s is due to the following: with the reform of the pension fund,

the government remained in charge of the retirees of the old system.

Payments to retirees caused a fourfold increaee of expenditures in this

area which was included in total social spending. This explains most of

the increase in real social expenditures per capita during the 1980s after

the aevere cuts in l97479 (Figure 12).

                   Meller (1991) argues that the adjustment measures of

the l980s were regressive even though the government was successful in

targeting social expenditures toward the very poor. The authorities

provided generous subsidies to dollar debtors while reducing subsidies to

the unemployed.

                   Poverty in Chile undoubtedly increased during the

military regime because of the deep recession in 1974 and 1983. Until the

last household survey in 1987, the economic recovery had not been enough

to improve the-lot of the low income groups. Social expenditures became

better targeted and in this sense became more efficient. But social

programs remained too modest to counteract the effects of unemployment

which remained high until 1988. On assuming power In 1990, the new

democratic government significantly increased the social effort. The new

government supports the view that good macroeconomic policies complemented
                                    23




by a safety net of well-designed social programs are essential for poverty

alleviation.

FOOTNOTES



1 See, for instance, Dorrtbusch and Edwards (1991).

2 Average annual monetary base calculated as the average of the base in

December of the current year and the base in December of the previous

yen.
  The regression implies a money demand of the form:

(14,2)                         h/y —

where A is a constant and the real interest rate, r, was assumed to be

irrelevant. With rO, this functional form implies that government revenue

from seigniotage always increases with inflation. With r—O, seignorage

revenue is maximized when it    —


  me     revenue from money creation is called eeigniorage. When inflation is

constant and income growth is zero, the seigniorage revenue is equal to

the inflation tax.

  The wage data is compiled by Cox Edwards (1991). Unfortunately, Brazil

and Bolivia which suffered from extreme inflation in the l9BOs, do not

have data for aggregate average wages. Bolivia's real minimum wage shows a

strong negative correlation with inflation, but minimum wagee are set by

the government and minimum wage slow growth might simply reflect an

attempt to reduce inflation. I also do not know whether the minimum wage

legislation was effective or not. In the case of Brazil, there is data for

average industrial wages in Rio de Janeiro end Sao Paulo. Between 1977 and

1980, average real wages and inflation are positively correlated because

of strong growth and adequate indexation. Between 1986 and 1990, when
                                         25




inflation speeds up, real wages in Rio fall. In Sao Paulo they oscillate

with industrial employment.

6 We must treat poverty measures with caution, as definitions and methods

of measurement differ significantly. Indices of poverty are based on a

broad indicator of economic resources. An individual is defined as poor if

his total consumption (or total income) falla below a specified level. An

extensive literature proposes a variety 0f indices which measure poverty

on a scale of zero to unity. The most simple procedure is to count the

number of poor and calculate the percentage of the population belonging to

this category (the headcount). Another popular index is the normalized

poverty gap, which is equal to the aggregate income short-fall of the poor

as a proportion of the poverty line, divided by population. Sen rejects

this measure as insensitive to the inequalicy among the poor and he

proposes that the poverty gap be weighted by the person's rank in the

ordering of the poor. His measure can be expressed as a combination of the

headcount index, the income gap, and the Cmi       measure    of inequality among

the poor (exact definition in Table 8, notes). Finally, the Foster-Creer-

Thorhecke's widely used measure (hereafter the Foster index) is based on

the sum of squared proportionate poverty gaps. It is similar to the

normalized poverty gap but it attaches greater weight to the income gaps

of the poorest individuals (exact definition in Table 5, notes).

*Notes: The three sources use approximately one fourth of one minimum wage
per capita corrected for inflation as the poverty line for a household:
a Romao (1991) specifies the cost of a food basket for different regions
of the country (approximately half the minimum wage) and uses a different
multiplier for each region ranging between 1.5 end 2.05. The poverty line
for the country is equivalent in 1986 prices to 0.885 of the minimum wage
of September 1986; b In Hoffmsnn (1989), the poverty line is equivalent to
the minimum wage in August 1980; o In Ravaillon (1991), the poverty line
is a household income per heed of one quarter of the minirrure wage (one
minimum wage for family of four) adjusted for inflation using the
consumer's price index for a low-income consumption bundle.
