A Portrait of the Artist as a Very Young or Very Old Innovator:
Creativity at the Extremes of the Life Cycle

                                          ABSTRACT

Orson Wells made Citizen Kane, his greatest movie, when he was 25 years old; Frank Lloyd Wright

designed Fallingwater, his most famous house, when he was 70. Contrasts as great as this raise the

question of whether there is a general explanation of when in their lives great innovators are most

creative. For each of seven artistic disciplines, this paper examines a major innovation made by a

very young artist, and another made by an old one, with the goal of understanding the role of the

artist's age and experience in the accomplishment. The analysis shows why youth was necessary for

the innovations of such conceptual artists as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Arthur Rimbaud, Maya Lin, and

Orson Welles, all of whom produced their masterpieces before the age of 30, and why extensive

experience was necessary for the innovations of such experimental artists as Piet Mondrian,

Elizabeth Bishop, Henrik Ibsen, and Frank Lloyd Wright, all of whom made major contributions

after the age of 60. This paper demonstrates the generality of the distinction between conceptual and

experimental innovators in artistic disciplines, and the value of the analysis in explaining the very

different relationships between age and creativity for the two types of artist.

                As I believe no man a real poet or genius of any sort who does not
                go on improving till eighty and over, I shall begin again and again
                as often as you set me right.

                You know, the great mystery that requires 20 years doesn’t exist in
                any field.

        Recent research on important painters, poets, and novelists has established that there are

two different types of creativity, and that each is associated with a distinct life cycle of important

achievements.3 Conceptual innovators arrive suddenly at innovations based on new ideas. These

often constitute immediate and radical changes in basic conventions of their disciplines.

Although these innovations can be made at any time, the most radical, and consequently the most

important, usually occur early in a career, when the artist has not yet become committed to habits

of thought about the discipline, and is better able to perceive and appreciate extreme deviations

from existing methods and practices.

        In contrast, experimental innovators arrive gradually at innovations based more heavily

on perception. Their major innovations normally appear piecemeal in increments, which are the

results of an extended period of trial and error. The greatest experimental innovations are based

on long chains of experimentation, and therefore usually emerge only after many years of work,

late in an artist’s career.

        The purpose of this paper is to sharpen our understanding of this analysis by examining a

series of extreme examples of both types of creativity. These are drawn both from the artistic

disciplines that have already been considered in this regard and from others that have not
                                                   4


previously been studied. Examining extreme cases - of important innovations made very early or

very late in artists’ careers - can serve to spotlight the most basic differences between the

conceptual and experimental approaches. Doing this in a wide variety of activities can

furthermore underscore the most basic elements that are common to each of the two types of

innovation.

       The conceptual innovations considered here were all made by artists aged 31 or younger;

one was produced by a poet at the age of just 16. The experimental innovations studied here were

all made by artists aged 58 and above; two were made by artists above the age of 70. All these

innovations were among the most important works of very important members of their

disciplines, and consequently most rank among the most important contributions to the

respective disciplines in their times. They include what many literature critics consider the Great

American Novel, and what most film critics consider the Great American Movie - indeed, the

Greatest Movie Ever Made.

       In every one of the following case studies, the goal is to understand the role of the artist’s

age, and career experience, in the accomplishment of the specific achievement selected. Thus for

the conceptual innovators a basic question is how an artist so young can make such an important

contribution to a discipline: what characteristics of the innovation reflect the artist’s youth? For

the experimental innovators, a basic question is why this late work is more important than most,

or all, of the artist’s earlier output: what about this innovation was aided by the artist’s

considerable experience? By asking these questions about these many individual masterpieces in

a diverse group of arts, we can gain greater insight into how age affects the production of major

artistic advances.

Fine Artists

               If Picasso is the archetypal finder, who, then, is the seeker?
               Mondrian, no doubt.
                                               David Sylvester, 19954
               I couldn’t imagine a more banal activity than simply providing
               visual kicks to the public.
                                               Joseph Kosuth, 19705

       Piet Mondrian arrived in New York in October, 1940, after the windows of his London

studio were broken and the house next to his was destroyed by German bombs. Mondrian

painted in New York for the next 3 ½ years, until his death in 1944. He spent much of that time

working on a group of paintings he had started in Paris and London and brought with him to

New York, and he consequently began and completed only three new paintings while in New

York. The last of these, Broadway Boogie-Woogie, which he completed in 1943, is reproduced in

more textbooks of art history than any other painting Mondrian executed in his career of more

than 50 years.6 Remarkably, therefore, the last painting Mondrian completed, at the age of 71, is

considered by art historians to be the most important one he ever made.

       Mondrian’s goals for his art were both vast and imprecise. He wrote extensively, if often

incomprehensibly, about the purposes of art and the means of achieving them. Both were

influenced by Mondrian’s belief in Theosophy. Carel Blotkamp explained that Mondrian took

from Theosophy the conviction “that all life is directed towards evolution, and that ... it is the

goal of art to give expression to that evolution.”7 A key turning point in Mondrian’s art occurred

around the time of his move from his native Holland to Paris in 1912, when his recognition of

the importance of Cubism led him to believe that abstraction could present a purer version of

reality, and consequently represent a more advanced stage of evolution. The aim of his art
                                                  6


became the creation of relationships between colors, and between shapes, that would transcend

naturalism:

               Pure abstract art becomes completely emancipated, free of
               naturalistic appearances. It is no longer natural harmony but
               creates equivalent relationships. The realization of equivalent
               relationships is of the highest importance for life. Only in this way
               can social and economic freedom, peace, and happiness be
               achieved.8

Mondrian believed that artists could serve as leaders of society in moving toward these universal

goals. He recognized that the goals were distant, but he was patient: “he never rushed himself,

apparently convinced that evolution in art, as in the universe, was an extremely slow process.”9

       Mondrian’s working methods were explicitly based on intuition: “Pure intuition becomes

conscious through long culture and creates pure abstract art, which arises neither from intellect

nor from vague intuitive feeling.”10 Although his geometric compositions are often assumed to

be the result of calculation, he told a friend this was never the case:

               I believe that it is possible by means of horizontal and vertical
               lines, created consciously but not calculatingly, guided by a higher
               intuition and brought to harmony and rhythm... to arrive at a work
               of art which is as strong as it is true ... And chance must be as far
               removed as calculation.11

The artist Harry Holzman, who financed Mondrian’s immigration to the United States and later

became his heir, confirmed Mondrian’s claim:

               There was no program, no symbols, no “geometry” or system of
               measure; only intuition determined the total rhythm of the
               relationships, by trial and error. The given space of the canvas, the
               given tension of its proportion, its size, were likewise
               experimentally determined and varied. Intuitive experience for
               Mondrian could only be direct, immediate, sensual.12

       The criteria that guided Mondrian’s experimentation were aesthetic. An artist who knew
                                                  7


Mondrian in Paris recalled watching him work in the 1920s: “if the black line was too thick, he’d

take a piece of white paper, or a paper of about the same color as the color planes next to that

line, and then he pasted it onto the canvas, and then held it at a distance to see ‘is the line the way

I want it or not.’”13 Similarly, a friend from his last years in New York explained that Mondrian

proceeded visually: “He tests each picture over a long period by eye: it is a physical adjustment

of proportion through training, intuition, and testing.”14

       Mondrian’s art developed gradually over decades of experimentation. John Golding has

pointed out that from an early stage of his career he worked in series, indicating that he was

concerned with themes rather than individual motifs.15 Michel Seuphor recalled that although the

differences between two paintings might appear insignificant to a layman, Mondrian often

considered the changes significant: “‘Even so, it’s another step,’ he once said to a friend who

was studying a new picture of his, ‘or don’t you think so? Don’t you find that it represents even a

little step forward?’”16 Mondrian’s dogged persistence made the cumulative effect of these many

little steps very great. As David Sylvester reflected, “A Mondrian retrospective is not just a

procession of great pictures, but a progression which in itself is an aesthetic experience: the

trajectory of the man’s art becomes as much a thing of beauty as the art.”17 The observation is

apt, for Mondrian’s lifelong quest came to have a goal more complex than simply making

images. A scholar who recently studied a group of paintings that Mondrian executed during the

last decade of his life concluded that “Mondrian’s painting practice in New York seems to reflect

an accelerating doubt about whether it is possible, or even desirable, ever to finish a painting...

Mondrian had not abandoned the idea of a product, just redefined it as a discovery or a solution,

not a painting.”18 Thus the painter Carl Holty wrote of visiting Mondrian’s studio in New York:
                                                  8


“Watching the pictures change into others as he worked, I asked him whether he wasn’t losing

good pictures in numbers because of his exigence. He said, ‘I don’t want pictures. I just want to

find things out.’”19

       Mondrian’s method of constructing his paintings involved extended revision and

correction, due to his uncertainty, but the geometric shapes and limited palette of primary colors

that made up his finished work are often taken to imply that his completed paintings are

impersonal and mechanical. So for example Clement Greenberg’s obituary of the painter

predicted that “Mondrian will be reproached for the anonymity with which he strove for the

ruled precision of the geometer and the machine in executing his paintings: their conceptions can

be communicated by a set of specifications and dimensions, sight unseen, and realized by a

draftsman.”20 A number of artists and critics denied this, however. John Coplans observed that,

particularly in Mondrian’s late works, “a very pronounced brushwork is an important

compositional element of his painting.” Coplans contended that in fact the surface of Mondrian’s

paintings subtly expressed the uncertainty and doubt that lay at the core of his art:

               Perfection and imperfection lie side by side within his paintings,
               mutually contradicting one another - the razor-sharp edge of the
               black lines contrasted against the suffused surfaces. This conflict
               between means and ends transmits a psychic tension... [T]his
               duality serves as a check against ritualization and virtuosity and
               enables his work to transmit the drama of search and struggle
               without making a spectacle of it.21

       Mondrian’s artistic goals, practices, and extended progress identify him as a

quintessentially experimental artist. The key question is how this helps us to understand why

Broadway Boogie-Woogie emerges as his most important individual work. The answer appears

to be that in this late painting Mondrian combined a number of elements that he had developed
                                                  9


and painstakingly refined over the course of more than 30 years with several bold new devices.

Meyer Schapiro pointed out the elements of Broadway Boogie-Woogie that Mondrian drew from

his own earlier work: “We see again the stabilizing grid; the molecular scattered units; the

repeated arrays of primary color as in his Neo-Impressionist phase; and the composition of large

squares applied as separate planes of color.”22 All these components had first appeared in

Mondrian’s paintings between 1909 and 1917. To these long-established elements of his

vocabulary Mondrian then added significant new departures. Thus in Broadway Boogie-Woogie

he eliminated the network of black lines that had characterized his work since his first encounter

with Cubism. As he explained to a curator, in 1943 he had decided that his use of black lines to

define planes constituted drawing rather than painting: “In drawing, the lines are the principal

means of expression; in painting, the color planes.”23 At the same time Mondrian introduced a

new illusion of three-dimensionality into his work: “At certain crossings of the grid, he has

extended the color of the square unit to a neighboring unit of one or the other band.

Distinguished by this accent, one band seems to come forward in crossing its perpendicular.”24 In

contrast to the stable, architectural effects of his paintings of the previous two decades, in his

great late paintings Mondrian achieved new depth, dynamism, and movement. This was a

product of the wisdom he had gained through four decades of research, based on both a profound

knowledge of his craft and an understanding of the value of the willingness to experiment with

bold new changes: “at the age of seventy-one he was quite prepared to begin his artistic life

anew.”25 Both his expertise and his openness to new approaches were direct consequences of the

experimental nature of Mondrian’s approach to art.

       In 1965, while he was a student at New York’s School of Visual Arts, Joseph Kosuth
                                                  10


made a work titled One and Three Chairs. It consists of a wooden folding chair, flanked on one

side by a life-size photograph of the same chair, and on the other by an enlarged photograph of a

dictionary definition of the word “chair.” Nearly four decades later, Kosuth is approaching the

age of 60, but One and Three Chairs remains by far his best-known work. A recent study found

that it is in fact the single work made by an American artist during the 1960s that is most often

reproduced in textbooks of art history.26 How did Joseph Kosuth produce a work this important

when he was just 20 years old?

       In 1964, Kosuth decided that painting was dead: “It was my belief that painting had been

dried up, used up.”27 He later explained that painting had served to enrich the visual experience

of people who lived prior to the 20th century, but that the development of modern technology -

movies, television, and transportation - had made this function obsolete: “The visual experiences

of the modern day man make paintings impotent and pathetic trophies to forgotten

aristocracies.”28 For Kosuth, Marcel Duchamp’s innovation of the unassisted readymade - the

presentation of unaltered manufactured objects as works of art - had decisively shifted the

emphasis of art from appearance to conception.29

       As a 20-year-old art student, Kosuth consequently decided that being an artist necessarily

involved questioning the nature of art. This could not be done using traditional means: “If you

make paintings, you are already accepting (not questioning) the nature of art.”30 He needed to

find an alternative means that emphasized conception and ideas rather than execution and

objects: “the artist’s duty is really to present new ideas - new ideas about what art is - not just to

make new works within the accepted framework.”31 Part of Kosuth’s solution to this problem lay

in the use of language: “I chose language for the ‘material’ of my work because it seemed the
                                                 11


only possibility with the potential for being a neutral non-material.”32 Another part of his

solution lay in using photography “as a non-art device as an alternative to painting within the art

context; I used photography in a way which was detached and indexed to the general use of

photography in the culture, rather than the craft of a ‘fine art’ of photography.” To emphasize the

insignificance of the craft of the photographic process, Kosuth never took his own photographs.33

       One and Three Chairs was one of the first products of this combination of language and

photography. Each time it was exhibited, Kosuth would have a new photograph of the chair

taken in its new location. He explained that the change in the object was part of its meaning:

               I liked that the work itself was something other than simply what
               you saw. By changing the location, the object, the photograph and
               still having it remain the same work was very interesting. It meant
               that you could have an art work which was that idea of an art
               work, and its formal components weren’t important. I felt I had
               found a way to make art without formal components being
               confused for an expressionist composition. The expression was in
               the idea, not the form - the forms were only a device in the service
               of the idea.34

       Kosuth’s emphasis on avoiding “expressionist composition” places him squarely within a

movement that had begun a decade earlier, in which Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank

Stella, Andy Warhol, and others had sought to create new forms of art that eliminated the

emotional and psychological symbolism of Abstract Expressionism, which had dominated

American art in the late 1940s and early ‘50s. Yet One and Three Chairs was among the most

radical attempts of the time to move art beyond physical objects into a more purely conceptual

realm. In doing this, it struck a responsive chord with many young artists who wished to separate

art from the commercialism of the market. As Kosuth later recognized, his early innovations

were part of a growing artistic protest against American society: “It is impossible to understand
                                                 12


this without understanding the sixties, and appreciate [Conceptual art] for what it was: the art of

the Vietnam war era.”35 Kosuth’s work quickly affected other artists, as both the role of language

and the use of photography became central elements of many of the most important

developments in fine art in the late 1960s and beyond.

       As Kosuth grew older, his views of art became somewhat more nuanced, and he qualified

his youthful categorical dismissal of painting. Thus for example at a symposium in 1982, he

explained that “Actually, when I first described [painting] as dead I was a kid - and I was

projecting into the future.”36 But in fact it was apparently the confidence and simplicity of his

youthful view of art that allowed him to make the radical departures from traditional artistic

practices that gained influence with other young artists who were seeking ways to present ideas

without making conventional art objects. That Kosuth could produce a contribution to fine art as

influential as One and Three Chairs at such an early age was a result of his success at creating a

form of art that embodied a complex idea without requiring the command of traditional artistic

methods and materials that required extensive study and practice.

Novelists

               Yes, that was and ever is my greatest torment - I never can control
               my material. Whenever I write a novel, I crowd it up with a lot of
               separate stories and episodes; therefore the whole lacks proportion
               and harmony.
                                              Fyodor Dostoevsky to Nikolay

               I want to write something new, something extraordinary and
               beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.

        There is widespread agreement with the judgment of Edward Wasiolek that “When

Dostoevsky completed The Brothers Karamazov in November of 1880 - less than three months

before his death - he was at the height of his creative powers.”39 There is also general agreement

that this final novel was Dostoevsky’s greatest achievement: Konstantin Mochulsky considered it

to be “not only a synthesis of Dostoevsky’s creative work, but also the culmination of his life,”

and Sigmund Freud declared that “The Brothers Karamazov is the most magnificent novel ever

written.”40

        Why Dostoevsky produced his greatest work at the age of 59, in the final year of his life,

can be understood by an artistic examination of his artistic goals and the methods he devised to

seek them. Dostoevsky devoted his art, and his life, to a pursuit of the unattainable: W. J.

Leatherbarrow observed that for him “truth was infinite, commensurate with the wisdom of

God’s creation, and the search for it was an unfinalizable spiritual - not merely intellectual -

quest.”41 The great novels of Dostoevsky’s final two decades presented a series of innovations

aimed at communicating this belief, and at gaining a deeper understanding of it.

        Mikhail Bakhtin argued that in these late works “Dostoevsky is the creator of the

polyphonic novel. He created a fundamentally new novelistic genre.”42 This innovation

constituted a new way to represent the indeterminacy and uncertainty of human life.43 In place of

the single controlling voice of earlier novelists, Dostoevsky created novels with “a plurality of

independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid

voices.”44 One consequence of this was that no single character became the organizing focus of

the novel: thus “the work seems to oscillate between several possible novels, each somehow

intended by a different character. It is this peculiar plurality that creates that special sense of
                                                  14


palpitating contradictoriness we recognize as quintessentially Dostoevskian.”45

        Dostoevsky believed in free will: as one scholar explained, he believed that “the future is

unpredictable not only because of innumerable casual factors but also because the past does not

wholly determine the present. It shapes, but does not make, our choices.”46 He employed a series

of devices to avoid a narrative structure that presented a linear sequence of events, and in so

doing made them appear inevitable. The polyphonic novel was a means of allowing the

characters of a novel “to be truly free, capable of surprising not only other characters but also the

author.” Dostoevsky’s creative process was “designed specifically to provoke unexpected events

or ideas, and the process would be a failure if it did not produce them.”47 Bakhtin approvingly

quoted the analysis of the critic Victor Shklovsky:

                Fyodor Mikhailovich loved to jot down plans for things; he loved
                even more to develop, mull over, and complicate his plans; he did
                not like to finish up a manuscript... As long as a work remained
                multi-leveled and multi-voiced, as long as the people in it were still
                arguing, then despair over the absence of a solution would not set
                in.48

Bakhtin observed that the same was true for individual characters: “As long as a person is alive

he lives by the fact that he is not yet finalized, that he has not yet uttered his ultimate word... In

[Dostoevsky’s] major heroes, ... the profound consciousness of their own unfinalizability and

indeterminacy is realized in very complex ways, by ideological thought, crime, or heroic deed.”49

In Bakhtin’s view, Dostoevsky’s plots were devised to make possible this open-endedness: “Plot

in Dostoevsky is absolutely devoid of any sort of finalizing functions. Its goal is to place a

person in various situations that expose and provoke him, to bring people together and make

them collide in conflict - in such a way, however, that they do not remain within this area of plot-
                                                  15


related contact but exceed its bounds.”50

       Gary Saul Morson has observed that many novelists are surprised by the actions of their

characters, as the authors’ initial plans are disrupted by the developing personalities of their

actors. Yet he noted that most authors then revise their manuscripts to hide their surprise from

readers, often by rewriting earlier sections so the characters’ actions no longer appear

inconsistent. Dostoevsky specifically avoided doing this, for he wanted readers to see that he had

not determined his characters’ fate in advance.51 One way he did this was through the

serialization of his novels. He avoided planning his novels beyond the episodes that he was

currently writing. Once these were published, and unexpected developments appeared in later

installments, readers would see that the characters’ fate “was open or, rather, they had no fate.

The work’s sections were to be understood as tending to no predetermined result, not as the mere

unfolding of a plan in several parts.”52

       From at least the time of The Idiot, which he published in 1868, Dostoevsky avoided

predetermining the outcomes of his novels. Joseph Frank wrote that after Dostoevsky completed

the first part of The Idiot, “it is clear from Dostoevsky’s notebooks and letters that he had no

satisfactory idea of how to continue the action. This uncertainty persists all through the middle

sections of the book, ... where Dostoevsky is obviously writing from scene to scene with only the

loosest thread of any central narrative line.”53 As Shklovsky observed, “Dostoevsky’s plans

contain by their very nature an open-endedness which in effect refutes them as plans.”54

Dostoevsky’s point was to communicate through the very composition of his novels the belief

declared by one of his characters in The Idiot: “It’s life that matters, nothing but life - the process

of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at all.”55
                                                  16


        Dostoevsky was a quintessential experiment seeker: as Malcolm Jones observed,

“Dostoevsky himself always insisted that the important thing was not the achievement of the

goal but the process of trying to reach it.”56 It is therefore not surprising that his greatest work is

valued for questions rather than answers: “The Brothers Karamazov matters not for its assertions

and not for its denials but for its questions, to which there are no easy answers... Dostoevsky is

important because of the questions he asks about his society and about the beliefs held by men in

it, and above all because of his ability to dramatize the questions and show that they are real

ones.”57

        That this greatest work came at the end of Dostoevsky’s career was not an accident, for

its greatness was a product of both his increasing technical mastery of his craft and his greater

insight into the human condition. Thus Mochulsky describes his earlier books as the laboratory

in which Dostoevsky developed the philosophical and artistic elements of Karamazov, with the

ideology taken from Diary of a Writer, the structure of the family chronicle from A Raw Youth,

the conflict between religious faith and disbelief from The Devils, and the scheme of a novel

about a major crime from The Idiot. Similarly, Mochulsky traces prototypes of Karamazov’s

central characters to the earlier novels.58 And beyond these literary survivals, Karamazov drew

on Dostoevsky’s personal struggles, not only his long reflection on religious belief but also his

experience of tragedy. Thus early in 1878 Dostoevsky’s work on Karamazov was interrupted by

the death of his three-year-old son Alyosha. In an attempt to assuage the writer’s grief, his wife

convinced him to visit the monastery of Optina Pustyn, where he met with the elder, Father

Ambrosius. Dostoevsky used his vivid knowledge of a parent’s grief in his poignant account in

Karamazov of the devastation of a peasant woman at the death of her child, and Dostoevsky’s
                                                     17


wife believed that the words Father Zosima used to console the woman in the novel were the

same ones that Father Ambrosius had asked Dostoevsky to convey to her in sending her his

blessing after the death of their son.59 From his survey of the sources of The Brothers

Karamazov, it is consequently not surprising that Mochulsky concludes that “spiritually

[Dostoevsky] had worked on it his entire life... Everything that he experienced, thought, and

created finds its place in this vast synthesis.”60

        F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby in 1925, when he was just 29 years old.

Although the book initially met with a mixed critical reception, and its sales greatly disappointed

Fitzgerald, since the writer’s premature death in 1940 Gatsby’s reputation has risen greatly.61

Today not only is there a broad consensus that it is Fitzgerald’s best work, but many scholars

consider it to be one of the greatest novels ever written by an American.62 Over time, as

recognition of the magnitude of Fitzgerald’s achievement in Gatsby increased, the discontinuity

it represented in his career became clear. Thus in 1966 a scholar observed that “One of the most

difficult problems in Fitzgerald scholarship in the nineteen-fifties and sixties has been the

attempt to explain the sudden maturing of Fitzgerald in 1925, with the publication of The Great

Gatsby. Nothing in Fitzgerald’s earlier writing prepares for the authority and the aesthetic control

over material that is so impressive in his third novel.”63 Perhaps equally puzzling is Fitzgerald’s

subsequent failure to match the quality of Gatsby. Thus John Berryman observed that “Suddenly

he was able, not yet thirty, to lay out and execute a masterpiece. He was happily married, widely

admired, and had made money. One might have expected such a career of production as

American artists rarely have achieved. What happened then?”64

        Fitzgerald’s sudden rise and fall can be understood as consequences of the conceptual
                                                 18


basis of his best fiction, which used lyrical prose, simplified characters, and symbolic stage props

and settings in the service of allegorical plots. So for example after Fitzgerald’s death, Lionel

Trilling reflected that the significance of The Great Gatsby lay in the ingenuity of its form,

which derived from its “intellectual intensity.” He observed that the book’s characters and

settings were all simplified symbols used to serve the story’s central idea:

               the characters are not “developed”: the wealthy and brutal Tom
               Buchanan, haunted by his “scientific” vision of the doom of
               civilization, the vaguely guilty, vaguely homosexual Jordan Baker,
               the dim Wolfsheim, who fixed the World Series of 1919, are
               treated, we might say, as if they were ideographs, a method of
               economy that is reinforced by the ideographic use that is made of
               the Washington Heights flat, the terrible “valley of ashes” seen
               from the Long Island Railroad, Gatsby’s incoherent parties, and
               the huge sordid eyes of the oculist’s advertising sign.

Trilling added parenthetically: “It is a technique which gives the novel an affinity with The

Waste Land.”65 T. S. Eliot himself appears to have appreciated the parallels between his own

poetry and the themes and techniques of Fitzgerald’s prose, for in 1925 he wrote to tell

Fitzgerald that Gatsby “excited me more than any new novel I have seen, either English or

American, for a number of years,” and that he considered it “the first step American fiction has

taken since Henry James.”66 More recently, Richard Ruland and Malcolm Bradbury described

Gatsby as “a symbolist tragedy” told with “a symbolist mode of writing that informs everything -

Gatsby’s dreams, parties, even his shirts - with an enchanted glow.”67

       Gatsby is elegant in both style and structure, and it is no surprise that lyric poets are

prominent among its admirers. When it was published Conrad Aiken called it “a highly colored

and brilliant little novel which, by grace of one cardinal virtue, quite escapes the company of

most contemporary American fiction - it has excellence of form,” and two decades later John
                                                19


Berryman judged that “The Great Gatsby is in Chekhov’s sense a purely graceful book (‘When a

man spends the least possible number of movements over some definite action, that is grace’).”68

Fitzgerald’s own confidence in his accomplishment similarly serves to identify Gatsby as a

conceptual breakthrough, for when he completed the book he wrote to his editor “I think my

novel is about the best American novel ever written.”69

       The technical basis for Fitzgerald’s maturation in The Great Gatsby has been traced to his

newfound ability to distance himself from the story. Like his earlier books, Gatsby was based on

Fitzgerald’s own experiences and feelings, but in Gatsby he used two specific literary devices to

achieve greater objectivity. One was what he called “composite characterization,” as Fitzgerald

explained that Jay Gatsby “started as one man I knew and then changed into myself - the

amalgam was never complete in my mind.”70 The second, which Fitzgerald apparently borrowed

from Joseph Conrad, was his use of an observer, rather than the author, as the book’s narrator.71

Both devices allowed Fitzgerald to attain a feeling of greater objectivity in Gatsby than in his

earlier novels, and thus to give a more universal significance to his own experiences and

feelings.

       The experience and feelings in question, however, were those of a young artist, and in

this lay the source of both the power of Fitzgerald’s achievement in Gatsby and his subsequent

inability to go beyond it. Critics have long been aware that the strength of Fitzgerald’s vision in

Gatsby came from its youthful simplicity and clarity. Lionel Trilling observed that “A writer’s

days must be bound each to each by his sense of his life, and Fitzgerald the undergraduate was

father of the best in the man and the novelist.” Trilling remarked that Fitzgerald was perhaps the

last significant writer to believe in the Romantic fantasy of heroism, and commented that “To us
                                                 20


it will no doubt come more and more to seem a merely boyish dream.”72 Alfred Kazin agreed,

noting that “Fitzgerald was a boy, the most startlingly gifted and self-destructive of all the lost

boys, to the end.” As such, he was able to create a small world, clearly perceived: “Fitzgerald’s

world is a little one, a superior boy’s world - precocious in its wisdom, precocious in its

tragedy.”73

       But Fitzgerald could not retain the simplicity of his vision throughout all of even his

relatively brief life. John Aldridge recognized this when he wrote that “Gatsby was written

during that fragile moment when the drive of youth meets with the intuitive wisdom of first

maturity, and before either the diseases of youth or the waverings of age begin to show

through.”74 J. B. Priestley appears to have had this same phenomenon in mind when he analyzed

what he called the two contrasting and opposed strains within Fitzgerald. The first, which

dominated his early work, was that of the optimistic and romantic adolescent who passed

through Princeton into the apparently unlimited opportunities of the 1920s, believing his life

would always be charmed. The second strain, a detached and cool observer who gained control

as the romantic boy withered in the face of disappointments and failures, was an adult artist-

priest dedicated to his craft but lacking in exuberance. Neither strain alone could produce the

highest art, and Priestley believed that Gatsby was Fitzgerald’s finest achievement “because it

seems to me to represent the one point of balance between these two conflicting strains in him,

the brief period when they were able to collaborate successfully.”75

       Interestingly, Fitzgerald appears to have understood not only the distinction drawn here

between conceptual and experimental artists, but also the difference in their creative life cycles.

Thus late in his life, in giving advice to his daughter about how she should prepare for a literary
                                                21


career, he wrote that “The talent that matures early is usually of the poetic, which mine was in

large part. The prose talent depends on other factors - assimilation of material and careful

selection of it, or more bluntly: having something to say and an interesting, highly developed

way of saying it.”76 His own explanation of the declining quality of his work after Gatsby does

not appear to have drawn on this analysis, however. Thus for example in 1929 he wrote to his

friend Ernest Hemingway that he believed that he had written too much in the five years prior to

the publication of Gatsby, and that he had used up all his material: the three novels, dozens of

stories, and many articles and movie scripts “may have taken all I had to say too early.”77

Elsewhere he offered a more poetic explanation:

               I have asked a lot of my emotions - one hundred and twenty
               stories. The price was high, right up with Kipling, because there
               was one little drop of something - not blood, not a tear, not my
               seed, in every story, it was the extra I had. Now it has gone and I
               am just like you now.78

From the vantage point of the present study, however, Fitzgerald was unable to match the

achievement of The Great Gatsby in the last 15 years of his life neither because he lacked subject

matter nor because he had used up his stock of some magical emotional elixir of artistry. Instead

the source of his artistic decline may simply have lain in the inevitable impact of accumulating

experience and aging, for the growth over time in the complexity of his perception of the real

world deprived him of the ability to recapture the simplicity and clarity of the allegorical world

he had created in his youth.

               bottom of a lake, monsters, mysteries.
                                            Arthur Rimbaud, 187379

               No matter what theories one may have, I doubt very much that
               they are in one’s mind at the moment of writing or that there is
               even a physical possibility that they could be.
                                              Elizabeth Bishop, 195080

       André Breton, the poet and founder of Surrealism, considered Arthur Rimbaud the father

of modern poetry.81 Remarkably, Rimbaud completed his career as a poet at the age of 19, when

he renounced literature; although he lived another 18 years, until his death at 37, he never again

wrote verse. Rimbaud had written what would become his most famous poem, “Le Bateau ivre,”

in 1871, when he was 16.82 A recent scholar called this “the first great Symbolist poem,” and it

has received considerable attention from poets as well as critics - among those who have

translated it into English, for example, are Samuel Beckett and Robert Lowell.83 These striking

facts about Rimbaud’s remarkable career dramatically raise the question of how he could make

so great an achievement so young, in such a brief span of time.

       Rimbaud grew up in the provincial town of Charleville, in northeastern France. He had an

unhappy childhood, and by his own account took refuge in imaginary adventures. He was a

brilliant student, and became a rebellious adolescent. At 15, with the encouragement of Georges

Izambard, a young poet who was one of his teachers, Rimbaud began to write poetry. The next

year Rimbaud wrote two letters, one to Izambard, the other to another young poet, which have

become known as the “Lettres du voyant.” In them Rimbaud proposed nothing less than a new

theory of poetry. Edmund Wilson observed that this theory, “though more violent and

apocalyptic than most expressions of Symbolist doctrine, prophesied the advent of Symbolism.”

Rimbaud believed that “one must be a visionary - one must make oneself a visionary.” This
                                                  23


would be achieved systematically through hallucination: “The poet makes himself a visionary

through a long, immense and reasoned derangement of all the senses.”84 By suppressing his

conscious senses, the poet would find a new voice. Thus Rimbaud declared that “It is wrong to

say: I think. One ought to say: I am being thought. I is Another.” Rimbaud effectively wanted the

poet to become the medium of an oracle, but rather than a divine oracle that spoke from without,

his goal was to find an oracle that came from within himself, the voice of the poet’s own

subconscious.85

       “Le Bateau ivre” was the first major work based on Rimbaud’s new theory. Wallace

Fowlie observed that it is “not only a successful poem in itself, it is the archetype of all future

work. It contains his principal themes, the order of his experiences, the evolution of his work and

his poetics.”86 The language of the poem literally describes the voyage of a drunken boat,

narrated by the boat, describing both its adventures and emotions, as it passes from servitude to

liberty, and finally to debilitation and disintegration. The poem is obviously allegorical, but the

symbolism is never clearly identified, and as a result there have been many different

interpretations of the poem.87 Like Rimbaud’s other poetry, “Le Bateau ivre” uses esoteric and

inventive language to produce vivid and complex images.

       The greatest literary influence on “Le bateau ivre” was Charles Baudelaire, who Rimbaud

considered “the first seer, king of poets.”88 Yet Marjorie Perloff has argued that Rimbaud made a

key departure from Baudelaire. Whereas the symbolism of Baudelaire’s poetry remained

anchored to his perception of external reality, Rimbaud’s “Le Bateau ivre” was no longer

concerned with providing links between his images and the outside world, but instead with

recording the processes of exploration of his own consciousness. This would constitute the
                                                 24


beginning of a powerful force, not only in modern poetry but in the arts in general, by creating an

art based not on perception but on conception. The artists who would follow this practice include

not only many Symbolist poets but also many leading painters of the twentieth century: thus for

example Picasso declared that he painted not what he saw, but what he knew based on his

acquaintance with specific real objects. Yet Rimbaud’s departure was even more radical, for in

presenting directly the products of the poet’s subconscious Perloff observed that he advocated

using the poem “as language construction in which the free play of possible significations

replaces iconic representation.”89 Thus, perhaps for the first time, Rimbaud produced modern art

that was not based in any way on representation of actual or even possible objects or

experiences. Rimbaud’s belief in the autonomous use of language and images accounts for the

enigmatic nature of the symbolism of “Le Bateau ivre,” and the many contending critical

readings of the poem. It also accounts for Rimbaud’s choice of an ocean voyage as the central

subject of the poem despite the fact that he had never seen an ocean.

       The importance of “Le Bateau ivre” thus appears to derive in large part from its role as

the first embodiment of a radical new theory of poetry, a work executed by a self-proclaimed

prophet whose goal was not only to revolutionize poetry, but to inspire other poets to become

visionaries and change society.90 Anna Balakian has attributed Rimbaud’s ability to make such a

bold departure specifically to his youth: “At heart, the deviation that his poetry represents is akin

to the sensations experienced in childhood. Every child in his dreams plays that delightful game

of creating a world which is as far removed from this one as possible, a world that becomes more

and more absurd as his efforts to pass the limits of the known are increased.” For Balakian,

Rimbaud’s poetry can be explained as a peculiar anomaly: “by a miracle - that imagination of
                                                 25


childhood, somewhat prolonged in him, was still his when he developed the philosophical and

verbal power which should have come much later, after that excessively imaginative impulse had

been attenuated.” This unlikely juxtaposition created in Rimbaud’s poetry “the only image

perhaps ever recorded of the world as seen through children’s eyes, a world wholly incompatible

with the age of reason.”91

       After retiring from literature at 19, Rimbaud went on to a career as an adventurer and

sometime African trader in a variety of commodities, including contraband guns and slaves, that

would make him an inspiration for twentieth-century artistic rebels ranging from Henry Miller

and William Burroughs to Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison. More remarkable than these later

escapades, however, was his ability to create new poetic forms, that would inspire major

twentieth-century movements in poetry and other arts, between the ages of just 16 and 19. This

ability was a direct consequence of the radically conceptual nature of his work, which combined

the vivid imagination of a child with the verbal skills of an adult.

       Elizabeth Bishop published her first poems in a high school magazine at the age of 14.92

Unlike Rimbaud, however, she continued to write verse in her 20s, and well beyond. In 1976, at

the age of 65, she published “One Art,” which is the second most frequently anthologized of all

her poems.93

       Bishop’s poetry is celebrated for its visual qualities. Randall Jarrell wrote that “all her

poems have written underneath, I have seen it,” and Robert Lowell declared in 1969 that “I am

sure no living poet is as curious and observant as Miss Bishop.”94 Bishop herself told a critic that

“the settings, or descriptions, of my poems are almost invariably just plain facts - or as close to

the facts as I can write them.”95 Her poems were crafted thoughtfully and painstakingly. In a
                                                 26


1947 review, Lowell described her poems as “unrhetorical, cool, and beautifully thought-out,”

and called Bishop “one of the best craftsmen alive.”96 In a poem written for Bishop in 1973,

Lowell compared her to the experimental painter Albert Ryder: “His painting was repainting, /

his tiniest work weighs heavy in the hand.” Ryder’s endless revision of his paintings, which left

them heavy from accumulated layers of paint, was Lowell’s analogy for Bishop’s extended

searches for just the right words to complete her poems: “Do / you still hang your words in air,

ten years / unfinished, glued to your notice board, with gaps / or empties for the unimaginable

phrase.”97

       Another friend of Bishop’s, Marianne Moore, praised her poetry for its understatement:

“With poetry as with homilectics, tentativeness can be more positive than positiveness, and in

North & South [1946] a much instructed persuasiveness is emphasized by uninsistence.”98

Bishop’s own statements of her goals often reflected her diffidence, as for example when she

told an interviewer that “I always try to stick as much as possible to what really happened when I

describe something in a poem.”99

       The descriptive intent of her poetry, its visual nature, her careful craftsmanship, and her

tentativeness all identify Bishop as an experimental artist. A biographer recognized this in

observing that Bishop was “a poet whose method was her message.”100 Bishop herself

emphasized that poetry was not merely a part of her life, but her way of living: “Writing poetry

is a way of life, not a matter of testifying but of experiencing. It is not the way one goes about

interpreting the world, but the very process of sensing it.”101

       Like other great experimental artists, Bishop developed her art gradually. In spite of her

instinctual reticence, over time her poetry became more personal, and drew more heavily on her
                                                  27


own thoughts and experiences.102 Reading the openly autobiographical poems her friend Robert

Lowell published in his landmark book Life Studies was one of the events that prompted her to

reconsider her own work.103 Thus in 1957, when Bishop was 46, in a letter to Lowell about his

new work she expressed her admiration for his achievement and frustration at her own timidity:

“Oh heavens, when does one begin to write the real poems? I certainly feel as if I never had. But

of course I don’t feel that way about yours - they all seem real as real - and getting more so.”104

Gradually thereafter Bishop’s own poetry became more autobiographical, and more assured. In a

review of a new volume of her poems in 1969, John Ashbery observed that Bishop’s work had

recently gained new maturity:

                Perhaps some of the urgency of the North & South poems [1946]
                has gone, but this is more than compensated by the calm control
                she now commands. Where she sometimes seemed nervous... she
                now is easy in a way that increased knowledge and maturity
                allow.105

Similarly, in a more recent review of Bishop’s career, Jacqueline Vaught Brogan concluded that

“Bishop’s verse matured as she did, so that her late work is her best.”106

        “One Art” appeared in the last of Bishop’s books published during her lifetime. It takes

the form of a villanelle, a 16th-century form made up of a series of three-lined stanzas and a final

quatrain, in which the first and third lines of the first stanza are repeated alternately in the

succeeding stanzas as a refrain, and together form a final couplet in the quatrain. Written ten

years after the suicide of Lota de Macedo Soares, who had been Bishop’s lover for more than 15

years, in “One Art” Bishop expressed both the enormity of her loss and her belief that the need to

write about it was the greatest source of her ability to bear that loss. Beginning with the

apparently innocuous statement that “The art of losing isn’t hard to master,” the poem effectively
                                                   28


portrays life as a series of losses, which grow as the poem proceeds, from trivial household items

to mementos, to houses, to cities, to continents, and finally to a loved one. The irony of the

opening statement grows with each repetition, as the increasing magnitude of the losses makes

them more and more painful to the author. The contrast between the rigid requirements of the

villanelle form and the poem’s intensely emotional subject serves to heighten the sense of pain,

for as the poem progresses the reader becomes increasingly aware of the enormous effort the

author is making to hold her emotions in check.107 In the poem’s final line Bishop violates the

villanelle’s strict form, interrupting the final refrain with a parenthetic instruction to herself -

“(Write it!)” - that underscores her recognition that it is only in producing her art that she can

endure her greatest loss. Bishop’s papers contain no less than 17 drafts of “One Art,” in the

course of which she not only searched for the right words, but carefully explored her

emotions.108 The poem reveals a mature artist subtly adapting a complex poetic form to her

purposes, firmly using the skill she has acquired over decades to help her understand and survive

her pain. The title of the poem implies that for Bishop her poetry and her life were one and the

same.

        In a eulogy for a friend, Elizabeth Bishop wrote: “There are some people whom we envy

not because they are rich or handsome or successful, although they may be any or all of these,

but because everything they are and do seems to be all of a piece, so that even if they wanted to

they could not be or do otherwise.”109 The observation applies equally to Bishop herself, with the

integration of her life and art, and her consistent efforts to achieve “clarity and simplicity.”110

The greatness of her late work was a consequence of her increasing technical mastery, born of

years of experimentation, combined not only with a growing understanding of her emotions, but
                                                 29


also a growing willingness to express that understanding in her art.

       In 1891 Emile Zola, as president of the Société des Gens de Lettres, awarded a

commission to Auguste Rodin for a sculpture of the novelist Honoré de Balzac, who had been a

founder of the literary society. When Rodin finally completed a plaster version of his Monument

to Balzac, seven years later, he was 58 years old. He considered the sculpture to be his most

important work, "the sum of my whole life, result of a lifetime of effort, the mainspring of my

aesthetic theory."113 Yet when the sculpture was exhibited at the Salon of 1898 it caused a storm

of protest by critics. The Société des Gens de Lettres voted to dishonor its contract and refuse the

statue, and a group of young artists actually plotted to vandalize it.114 Stung by the criticism,

Rodin withdrew Balzac from the Salon, and moved it to his home outside Paris. The statue was

not cast in bronze until 1939, more than two decades after Rodin's death. George Heard

Hamilton observed of Balzac that “the true originality of the work was reflected in the fact that

there were no proper words to confine it;” Alfred Barr described it as “one of the very great

sculptures in the entire history of Western art.”115

       Rodin's career developed slowly. His early failure in three attempts to gain admission to

the prestigious Ecole des Beaux Arts caused him to spend nearly two decades as an assistant to
                                                 30


other sculptors, and he did not begin to enjoy real professional success until the age of 40. His art

also developed slowly. Rainer Maria Rilke, who worked for several years as Rodin's secretary,

observed that “his work developed through long years. It has grown like a forest.”116 The reason

for this was clear to Rilke, for he explained that Rodin's art “depended upon an infallible

knowledge of the human body” that he acquired slowly and painstakingly: “His art was not built

upon a great idea, but upon a craft.”117 It was not only Rodin's craft that grew slowly, but also

individual works: “I am unfortunately a slow worker, being one of those artists in whose minds

the conception of work slowly takes shape and slowly comes to maturity.”118

       Rodin's experimental art was avowedly visual: “I strive to express what I see with as

much deliberation as I can.”119 Ideas did not precede, but followed, form: “One must never try

to express an idea by form. Make your form, make something, and the idea will come.”120 The

realism of Rodin’s figures was such that early in his career he was dogged by charges that he had

cast his sculptures from life. Infuriated by these rumors, he subsequently took care to make his

figures larger than life size. He did not work from imagination or memory, but always in the

presence of a model: he confessed that “I have no ideas when I don’t have something to copy.”121

Unlike some sculptors who made figures that were intended to be seen only from the front, or

who might made a figure from a single front and single back view, Rodin created figures that

were to be seen in the round. His working process was iterative and incremental:

                       I place the model so that light, outlining it against a
               background, illuminates the contour. I execute it, I change my
               position and that of my model, and thus I see another contour, and
               so on successively all around the body.
                       I begin again; I come closer and closer to the contours, and
               I refine them.
                       Since the human body has an infinite number of contours, I
                                                                  31


                multiply them as far as possible or so far as I think useful.122

       Rodin’s awareness of the body’s infinite number of contours makes it unsurprising that

he often had difficulties with completing his sculptures. He was incapable of planning his

projects in advance, and usually began his works without any clear conception of their final

appearance.123 He admitted that “I often begin with one intention and finish with another.”124 He

often reached an impasse and put a work aside for a time: “I lay my work aside while it is yet

unfinished, and for months I may appear to abandon it. Every now and then, however, I return to

it and correct or add a detail here and there. I have not really abandoned it, you see, only I am

hard to satisfy.”125 Nor did this process always result in a successful outcome, particularly with

large and complex works that would have benefited from careful planning. Thus George Heard

Hamilton voiced a common criticism of Rodin when he remarked that he was “not strictly a

monumental sculptor, for he had difficulty in imposing a formal unity upon many separate

elements.”126

       Rodin in fact became known, by some admirers as well as many detractors, as a sculptor

of unfinished works. In 1889 Edmond de Goncourt criticized Rodin’s figures for incomplete

execution, and compared his sculpture to recent developments in painting: “Amidst the present

infatuation with Impressionism, when all of painting remains in the sketch stage, [Rodin] ought

to be the first to make his name and gloire as a sculptor of unfinished sketches.”127 Rodin

defended his fragmentary works against the charge that they were unfinished: “When my works

do not consist of the complete body ... people call it unfinished. What do they mean?

Michelangelo’s finest works are precisely those which are called ‘unfinished.’”128 Rudolf

Wittkower has argued that Rodin’s fragmentary sculptures were in fact finished: “The discovery
                                                  32


that the part can stand for the whole was Rodin’s, and Brancusi along with scores of other

sculptors accepted the premise. In contrast to Michelangelo, whose unfinished works were

unfinished, Rodin created partial figures which are the finished product.”129 Years of study of

Rodin’s methods, however, led Albert Elsen to a different conclusion about both the fragments

and the complete figures: “What now seems heroic and contemporary about Rodin is ... his

passion for the act of making rather than completing sculpture... His personal problem was in

setting for himself impossible absolutes of perfection toward which he dedicated a lifetime of

striving. It is doubtful that at his death he would have pronounced any of his works finished or

immutable.”130 Rodin himself recognized that he often sacrificed good works to the pursuit of

perfection: “Wishing to do better, one sometimes demolishes even what one has done well; but

one must be possessed by the demon of the best.”131

          Characteristically, Rodin produced the Monument to Balzac through a long process of

trial and error. Elsen’s analysis of the many works that made up this project prompted him to

observe that “One must look at the whole long series to see how slowly and naturally Balzac’s

posture and the position of his limbs evolved, rather than resulting from a sudden decision.”132

Rodin failed to meet several deadlines for delivery of the statue, and on one of these occasions he

expressed his frustration: “As if it were possible, while one is searching, to be ready on a fixed

date!”133 Even when he finally delivered the work in 1898, Rodin would have liked to keep it

longer:

                 I should prefer to contemplate it every day for a while, and wait
                 until a sudden inspiration, such as occasionally flashes through the
                 brain, came to flood my imagination and enable me to perfect and
                 idealize my work. For a work, even when achieved, is never
                 perfect; it is always susceptible to a modification that can increase
                                                                   33


                its beauty.134

        The Monument to Balzac made striking use of Rodin’s central contributions to sculpture.

Rodin wanted his sculptures to represent figures in movement, and he often animated them by

fixing transitory gestures and poses. Thus he portrayed Balzac not in formal dress or in quiet

reflection, but instead in the monk’s robe he wore while working, in a dramatic stance, his head

thrown back in a moment of creative inspiration:

                By convention, a statue in a pubic place must represent a great man
                in a theatrical attitude which will cause him to be admired by
                posterity. But such reasoning is absurd. I submit there was only
                one way to evoke my subject. I had to show Balzac in his study,
                breathless, hair in disorder, eyes lost in a dream, a genius who in
                his little room reconstructs piece by piece all of society in order to
                bring it into tumultuous life before his contemporaries and
                generations to come.135

Rodin was also concerned with creating atmospheric effects that would integrate his figures with

their environment. The jagged profile of Balzac, the deep cavities of the face and hair, and the

rough surface of the robe all created strong contrasts of light and shadow that called attention to

the relationship between the figure and its surroundings. Throughout Rodin’s career he had used

subjects that were not conventionally beautiful, but in the rough treatment of the Monument to

Balzac he “created the first authentically ‘ugly’ work of modern art.”136 The effectiveness with

which Rodin combined these characteristic concerns and practices was a direct consequence of

the maturity of this late stage of his career. As Rilke declared in tribute to his friend, “it is an

underlying patience in Rodin which renders him so great.”137

        Futurism was founded as a literary movement in 1908 by the Italian poet F. T. Marinetti,

and the next year it was extended into painting, under the leadership of a young artist named
                                                 34


Umberto Boccioni. In 1912 Boccioni decided to learn to make sculptures, and he devoted a year

to that art before returning to painting. World War I effectively brought Futurism to an end in

1916, and in that year Boccioni was killed while serving in the Italian army. John Golding has

observed that in its brief career Futurist visual art produced a single major masterpiece, a

sculpture by Boccioni titled Unique Forms of Continuity in Space.138 A recent survey confirmed

Golding’s judgment, finding that this sculpture is illustrated in more textbooks of art history than

any single work by such great modern sculptors as Rodin, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti,

and David Smith.139 Remarkably, therefore, although Boccioni’s total production of sculptures

has been estimated at just a dozen, one of these, which he executed at the age of 31, is among the

most celebrated sculptures of the modern era.

       Futurism was a conceptual movement from the outset. Marinetti stated one of its central

themes in his first Futurist manifesto in 1909 when he declared that “the world’s magnificence

has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.”140 A central concern of Futurist

painting would consequently be the representation of motion. When Boccioni and four other

painters joined the movement, they explained that they wanted not to portray “a fixed moment in

universal dynamism,” but rather “the dynamic sensation itself”; to represent movement over

time, they intended to create visual syntheses of “what one remembers and of what one sees.”141

       A central feature of Futurism was its self-consciously revolutionary attitude. Marinetti’s

founding statement in 1909 described itself as a “violently upsetting incendiary manifesto,” and

the painters who joined him the next year opened their first manifesto with a declaration that

theirs was a “cry of rebellion.”142 A closely associated theme was the youth of the participants, as

Marinetti’s first manifesto remarked that “the oldest of us is thirty, so we have at least a decade
                                                  35


for finishing our work” before they would be surpassed by younger artists.143

       In a number of respects Futurism became a prototype for later art movements, perhaps as

much for its novel practices as for its art. Malevich and many other advanced artists learned the

Futurist lesson that written texts could be a valuable tool in expanding the audience for

innovative conceptual art. In less than a decade Futurist artists produced dozens of pamphlets,

usually specifically titled as manifestos, on subjects ranging from poetry and painting to theater

and film, and even to new forms of men’s clothing.144 Historians have observed that the

Futurists’ publication of manifestos typically preceded the execution of the relevant works of art,

and have remarked that this effectively made the manifestos blueprints for works of art.145

Marjorie Perloff also made the observation that with this practice the Futurists made the

manifestos a part of their art: “to talk about art becomes equivalent to making it.”146 It appears

that the influence of Futurism was increased not only by the function of written texts as

supporting documents for works of art, but in some cases directly by the texts, even in the

absence of associated works of art.147 The texts could in fact have an impact even on artists who

rejected the Futurists’ art. So for example in 1912 Franz Marc wrote to his friend Kandinsky of

the Futurists that “I cannot free myself from the strange contradiction that I find their ideas, at

least for the main part, brilliant, but am in no doubt whatsoever as to the mediocrity of their

works.”148

       In 1909 Boccioni was an ambitious young painter working in a conventional Post-

Impressionist style when he met the dynamic Marinetti, who described himself as the “caffeine

of Europe.”149 Marinetti inspired Boccioni, and proceeded to “drag him, technically unprepared

and with a torrent of only partially formulated ideas, into the mainstream of modern art.”150
                                                  36


Boccioni quickly adopted a highly conceptual approach to art. Thus he wrote to a friend that a

new painting was “done completely without models, and all the tricks of the trade are sacrificed

to the ultimate cause of emotional expression ... [T]he emotion will be presented with as little

recourse as possible to the objects that have given rise to it.”151

       Boccioni and the other Futurist painters aimed to portray motion as a dynamic process

that occurred and was experienced over time. They also wanted to represent the tendency of both

light and motion to destroy the concreteness of forms, thus emphasizing the interplay between

objects and their environment.152 Late in 1911 Boccioni spent a month in Paris, where he saw

new Cubist techniques that he quickly adapted to Futurist ends in his paintings.153 While in Paris

Boccioni appears to have become aware that there was not yet a Cubist school of sculpture, and

that sculpture had consequently lagged behind painting in the development of advanced art. A

consequence of this was that he might make an immediate impact on the art world by extending

the concerns of Futurist art to sculpture.154 In March of 1912 Boccioni wrote to a friend that “I

am obsessed these days by sculpture. I think I can perceive a complete revival of this mummified

art.”155 The next month he published a manifesto proposing a Futurist sculpture that would both

represent movement and portray the interaction of the figure and its environment.156

       Boccioni then began to make sculptures.157 In June of 1913 he exhibited 11 sculptures at

a Paris gallery. Guillaume Apollinaire’s review praised his achievement: “Varied materials,

sculptural simultaneity, violent movement - these are the innovations contributed by Boccioni’s

sculpture.” Apollinaire closed the review with a facetious reference to Unique Forms of

Continuity in Space: “Flash: We have been informed that Boccioni’s “muscles at full speed”

have taken to the road. As of this writing, they have not been recaptured.”158
                                                  37


       In Unique Forms, the surfaces of an advancing figure are broken into parts, but instead of

the straight lines and sharp angles of Cubism they have been transformed into irregularly curved

planes that blend together in a graceful composition. Their orientation and aerodynamic shapes

create forms that appear bulky and muscular at the same time that they seem to flow in response

to strong winds blowing in the face of the figure. In this sculpture Boccioni produced a novel

synthesis, drawing on plastic forms taken from classical Greek sculpture and techniques of

spatial organization borrowed from advanced modern painting, to create a three-dimensional

representation of the effects, in both vision and memory, of a combination of power and speed.

       Boccioni considered Unique Forms “the most liberated” of his sculptures.159 He

apparently gave up sculpting after he executed it, and Golding concluded that “with its

completion, Boccioni seems to have realized that he had achieved the definitive masterpiece for

which he longed.”160 Not only did Boccioni succeed in making a major contribution to modern

sculpture at the age of just 31, but he did it just a year after making his first sculptures. Even

then, he believed that he could have achieved much more, and at an earlier age, under the proper

circumstances. Thus when he reported to a friend Apollinaire’s praise for his 1913 exhibition, he

added that in spite of his excitement at his success, “I end up sad and discouraged. I think about

what I would have done by now if I had grown up with Paris or Berlin as my environment.”161

               wish, or a simple puppet, the deformation by a schoolboy of one of

               world.

                                               Alfred Jarry, December 10, 1896163

        A recent survey called Hedda Gabler “perhaps the most perfectly structured play of the

modern theater.”164 It was written by Henrik Ibsen in 1890, when he was 62 years old, and was

one of a series of plays that made Ibsen the preeminent dramatist of the late nineteenth century.

        Ibsen is commonly described as the founder of the modern theater.165 He is celebrated for

the innovation of the realistic drama. Ibsen once explained that “My object was to make the

reader feel that he was going through a piece of real experience.”166 George Bernard Shaw

observed that when Ibsen began writing, the theater dealt largely with contrived situations, “and

it was held that the stranger the situation, the better the play.” Ibsen changed this: “He gives us

not only ourselves, but ourselves in our own situations. The things that happen to his stage

figures are things that happen to us.”167 In his first published article James Joyce had made the

same observation: “Ibsen has chosen the average lives in their uncompromising truth for the

groundwork of all his later plays.”168

        Ibsen achieved this realism by beginning with his characters: “Always I proceed from the

individuals; the stage-setting, the dramatic ensemble, all that comes naturally, and causes me no

worry, once I feel sure of the individual in every aspect of his humanity.”169 Once Ibsen had his

characters in mind, writing a play was a process of getting to know them, and he did this in a

series of stages:

                As a rule, I make three drafts of my dramas which differ very
                much from each other in characterization, not in action. When I
                proceed to the first sketch of the material I feel as though I had the
                degree of acquaintance with my characters that one acquires on a
                railway journey... With the next draft I see everything more
                clearly, I know the characters just about as one would know them
                after a few weeks’ stay in a spa; I have learned the fundamental
                                                                      39


                 traits in their characters as well as their little peculiarities; yet it is
                 not impossible that I might make an error in some essential matter.
                 In the last draft, finally I stand at the limit of knowledge; I know
                 my people from close and long association - they are my intimate
                 friends, who will not disappoint me in any way.170

Ibsen developed his characters during this process not only through their speeches, but also their

actions: “Many of the details occur to me during the process of composition, bit by bit as I get

along.”171 Their physical appearance could also change, for Ibsen had to visualize the characters

as he wrote: “To write is to see.”172 In view of the central role of characterization in Ibsen’s

process of composition, it is not surprising that Henry James would predict that Ibsen would

always be loved by actors: “He cuts them out work to which the artistic nature in them joyously

responds - work difficult and interesting, full of stuff and opportunity.”173 Just a few years later,

a leading actor confirmed James’ view: “It is easier, I think, to get inside the skin of an Ibsen part

than any other, for the simple reason that the characterization is so minute and elaborate, the

words are so full of suggestion, that the actor has infinite scope for the exercise of his best

qualities.”174

        The primary importance of characterization points to the experimental nature of Ibsen’s

art, as does another central feature of his plays, their focus on change. Arthur Miller concluded

that “If his plays, and his method, do nothing else they reveal the evolutionary quality of life.

One is constantly aware, in watching his plays, of process, change, development.”175 Eric

Bentley explained that this awareness was a product of Ibsen’s method of exposition: “Generally,

with Ibsen, we feel we are his companions in a search and therefore... are not given summaries of

what has been thought already but are present at the thinking.”176 In his major late plays the

endings were often not fully resolved, reflecting “a conception of life which Ibsen considered
                                                 40


more true than that represented by the stage convention of a conclusively happy or tragic end as

the curtain falls.”177 Elizabeth Hardwick observed that in Ibsen’s late plays “His people are not

fixed. They are growing, moving, uncertain of their direction in life.” She traced this quality to

an uncertainty in the playwright: “We feel Ibsen himself created certain characters out of a

musing wonder and deep, intriguing uncertainty.”178

       Ibsen developed his mature art in an extended series of major works, ranging from A

Doll’s House (1879) and The Wild Duck (1884) through Hedda Gabler (1890) to The Master

Builder (1892) and John Gabriel Borkman (1896). All of these plays embodied his distinctive

innovations, including the use of discussion as a primary focus of interest, and the portrayal of

realistic characters, and actions, that had the effect of “making the spectators themselves the

persons of the dramas.”179 The plays’ subject matter directly treated major social issues of their

time. True to his experimental nature, Ibsen’s work did not change abruptly but evolved

gradually: “Ibsen chose the path of constant development ... Not the smallest fascination of Ibsen

is the unity of his work, the profound meaning in the relation of play to play.”180

       No single play dominates Ibsen’s career, but Hedda Gabler was among his greatest

achievements. In a contemporary review, Henry James remarked that the study of an exasperated

woman would not have seemed a promising subject, but that the play demonstrated “the folly of

quarreling with an artist over his subject. Ibsen has had only to take hold of this one in earnest to

make it, against every presumption, live with an intensity of life.”181 For many critics Hedda was

Ibsen’s greatest character; thus Harold Bloom declared that “What Anna Karenina was to

Tolstoy, and Emma Bovary to Flaubert, Hedda was to Ibsen.”182 Elizabeth Hardwick observed

that “Hedda Gabler challenges and pleases and is the most fascinating, humanly interesting of
                                                 41


Ibsen’s women. Actresses long to play the role.”183 John Northam explained that Ibsen’s success

in this characterization was a result of his subtle use of his full experience as a playwright: “our

informative details have been infinitely small, and ordinary; but they have been organized so

precisely, into patterns so self-consistent that through them we have become aware of the

development of a character whose main failing was inarticulateness... Through visual suggestion

we have come to know the stifling pressures and the fierce reaction... We have been reached, not

by the novelist’s techniques operating solely through the mind, but through the eyes; never was

Ibsen more a practicing playwright than he was when he created Hedda Gabler.”184

       Ibsen’s innovations made his plays extremely controversial in his own time. The loudest

complaints came from those who believed that the theater should provide amusing entertainment

in ways that would not challenge prevailing social values. These complaints most often

denounced the ugliness of Ibsen’s subjects. So for example one London critic declared that

“Hedda Gabler is the study of a malicious woman of evil instincts, jealous, treacherous, cold-

hearted, and, as it seems to us, wholly out of place on the stage,” while another reflected that “to

conceive of the Ibsen drama gaining an extensive or permanent foothold on the stage is hardly

possible. Playgoing would then cease to be an amusement and become a penance.”185 Other

critics complained that their evening’s entertainment lacked any edifying resolution: “If [Ibsen]

is a prophet, he is one who has no mission, no message to give us ... He only puts the destroying

question; never does he furnish even a hint of the saving answer.”186 Yet to many young artists

Ibsen’s dramas were intensely exciting, as they laid the foundations for a theater that would

explore important social and psychological problems, and in so doing become a more integral

part of modern intellectual life. In recognition of this Luigi Pirandello, one of the leading
                                                   42


playwrights of the next generation, declared that “After Shakespeare, without hesitation, I put

Ibsen first.”187

        In 1961, a critic named Martin Esslin published a book defining a movement he called

the Theater of the Absurd, which included such playwrights as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco,

Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter. Esslin declared that this theater “strives to express its sense of the

senselessness of the human condition and the inadequacy of the rational approach by the open

abandonment of rational devices and discursive thought.” Esslin dated the beginning of this

movement very precisely, to the evening of December 10, 1896, when a Paris theater company

first presented Ubu Roi, a play written by Alfred Jarry.188

        Jarry was 23 years old when Ubu Roi opened in Paris. The origins of the work went back

eight years, to when the 15-year-old Jarry and two school friends in a provincial lycée first wrote

a puppet play about their physics teacher. The obese and incompetent teacher had long been

ridiculed by his students, and Jarry and his friends drew on a rich oral tradition in satirizing

Monsieur Hébert, whose name had variously been transformed into Heb, Hébé, and eventually

Ubu. Unlike his classmates, Jarry persisted in developing the epic history of the imaginary

adventures of Ubu even after he left school.

        At 17 Jarry moved to Paris, where he soon abandoned his plans to attend college in favor

of becoming a writer. He became part of a literary group that included the leading Symbolist

poets and novelists of the time, and began to publish stories about Ubu and his supposed science

of “´Pataphysicks.” Although Jarry’s language was often bombastic, he in fact worked

methodically in developing ´Pataphysicks into a system:

                   ´Pataphysicks is the science of the realm beyond metaphysics... It
                                                                43


               will study the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the
               universe supplementary to this one...
                       Definition: ´Pataphysicks is the science of imaginary
               solutions.189

Jarry wanted to create a theater purely of the imagination, that made no appeal to facts or logic.

As a recent biographer explained, in Jarry’s conception “theater should imitate the logic of

dreams, and should therefore employ symbolism, condensation, disconnection of images, and

displacement; it should have an elusive, ephemeral and haunting quality.”190

       In Ubu Roi, the greedy and cowardly Ubu becomes King of Poland, tortures and kills

many of his subjects, and is ultimately chased out of the country. The monstrous character of

Ubu drew liberally upon that of Falstaff and the inspiration of Rabelais, and the staging of the

play was based on the marionette forms in which Jarry had first performed it. When Ubu Roi was

first presented to the public in 1896, the play had been widely advertised and its opening night

was attended by many of Paris’ leading critics and eminent literary figures. Controversy began

immediately. When the curtain was raised, the actor portraying the gross Ubu stepped forward

and spoke his first line, a common obscenity that Jarry had appropriated to ´Pataphysicks by

adding a single letter. The audience erupted into shouting, whistling, and even fighting as

admirers and detractors expressed their approval, shock, and anger. The actors had to wait 15

minutes before the play could resume, and many more interruptions followed in the course of the

evening.191

       Ubu Roi was given a second performance the next evening, but then closed, and was

never again performed in Jarry’s lifetime. Yet the impact of its opening night gave Jarry

immediate fame in literary circles, as for weeks afterward favorable and unfavorable views of the
                                                 44


play were debated in Paris’ major newspapers. This proved to be the high point of Jarry’s career.

He continued to write about Ubu, and over time began to assume the character’s manner of

speaking. Not unlike Rimbaud, Jarry attempted to stimulate his imagination through

hallucination, which eventually proved self-destructive.

       Roger Shattuck observed that “at thirty Jarry had completed his best years, enjoyed a

unique notoriety in the literary world of Paris, and was already looked up to by a new

generation.”192 Among his young followers were the symbolist poet Guillaume Apollinaire and

Apollinaire’s friend Pablo Picasso, who became fascinated by Jarry and appropriated many of his

eccentricities, even, after Jarry’s death, carrying around the gun that Jarry had always kept with

him. John Richardson, the most exacting biographer of Picasso’s early career, has argued that

Picasso’s breakthrough into Cubism in 1907 was inspired not only generally by the iconoclastic

example of Jarry’s efforts to blend fantasy and reality in ´Pataphysicks, which aimed to abolish

traditional standards of beauty and good taste, but even more specifically by a particular

illustration that Jarry gave for his new science. Thus Richardson argues that Jarry anticipated the

multiple viewpoints of Cubism in a ´Pataphysickal treatise of 1898: “to claim the shape of a

watch is round [is] a manifestly false proposition - since it appears in profile as a narrow

rectangular construction, elliptical on three sides; and why the devil would one only have noticed

its shape at the moment of looking at the time?”193

       Jarry died at the age of just 34, of tuberculosis aggravated by his drinking. His major

achievement, Ubu Roi, had already made a powerful impression on many Symbolist artists. So

for example immediately after the play’s first performance Stéphane Mallarmé had written to

Jarry that in Ubu he had created “a prodigious personage of rare and resistant texture, and you
                                                 45


have done it as a sure, sober, dramatic sculptor. He has joined the repertory of the best taste and

already haunts me.”194 Many years later, another playwright who had also attended that first

performance reflected that “the schoolboy Jarry, to mock a professor, had without knowing it

created a masterpiece in painting that somber and oversimplified caricature with brushstrokes in

the manner of Shakespeare and the puppet theater.”195 Whether or not Jarry recognized the

importance of his achievement, in Roger Shattuck’s apt words “the schoolboy imagination had

succeeded in throwing dung in the public eye.”196 Jarry’s ability to do this appears to have

depended critically on his youth, for both the simplicity of his artistic vision and the confident

iconoclasm with which he presented it to the public are hallmarks of the youthful conceptual

innovator.

Architects

               Each day we feared that he’d change what he had settled the day
               before. We’d point out as he started revising a drawing, “But Mr.
               Wright, yesterday you decided it this way.” His answer was
               standard. “That was all right yesterday, but it’s not right today.” He
               never left anything alone. He no sooner got a system going than
               he’d upset it all.

       Frank Lloyd Wright began his career as an architect in 1887, at the age of 20. Over the

course of the next 72 years he produced designs for more than 1000 buildings, of which more

than 400 were constructed. No single building has clearly emerged as his greatest work, but

among those that have received the greatest attention is Fallingwater, a house Wright built at
                                                46


Bear Run, Pennsylvania, in 1937, when he was 70 years old. When the house was completed,

Time featured Wright on its cover, with a drawing of the house behind him - the first time the

magazine had an architect on its cover.199 A recent survey of American architecture described

Fallingwater as “Wright’s most famous building of all,” and a leading architectural scholar called

it “one of the complete masterpieces of twentieth-century art.”200

       Early in his career Wright formulated a set of propositions to define his concept of

organic architecture, which “evolved from a set of architectural principles in the 1890s into a

lifestyle by the 1930s.”201 These principles emphasized the importance of simplicity of form,

harmony between a building and its natural setting, the use of natural colors, and using materials

to express their own nature rather than imitating other materials. Wright wanted buildings to

share the human virtues of sincerity, truthfulness, and graciousness. Within these basic

guidelines Wright developed distinctively new architectural forms, which never ceased to change

as he continually experimented throughout his long career. Yet Wright’s style evolved gradually,

and a recent survey concluded that “when we look at the totality of his oeuvre, we see in his form

language a remarkable coherence, continuity, and recurrence of motifs.”202

       By 1900, Wright had developed his celebrated Prairie Style. Its distinctive features

included an emphasis on long horizontal lines, relating its buildings to the open spaces of the

Midwestern plains, and a blurring of the distinction between interior and exterior spaces,

achieved through covered but open areas around a building’s perimeter.203 Over time Wright

continued to experiment and to simplify the style, and the most famous of the Prairie houses,

Chicago’s Robie House, was completed in 1910.

       Wright’s experimental approach is revealed not only in the continual evolution of his
                                                 47


style but also in his reluctance to determine his buildings’ final forms. He advised architects to

let their ideas grow slowly:

               Conceive the building in the imagination, not on paper but in the
               mind... Let it live there - gradually taking more definite form
               before committing it to the draughting board. When the thing lives
               for you - start to plan it with tools... Working on it with triangle
               and T-square should modify or extend or intensify or test the
               conception.204

During the time the design was taking shape, or “germinating,” Wright needed to have its setting

firmly in mind: “A building should appear to grow easily from its site and be shaped to

harmonize with its surroundings.”205 Wright not only avoided committing himself to plans on

paper as long as possible, but he typically made changes in his projects until the actual materials

were set in place, and sometimes even after. A biographer observed that “his impromptu methods

of designing, which led to his continual failure to prepare complete working drawings, made it

necessary for him to be on the site as often as possible during the time that a building was under

construction.” Although this annoyed many builders, and dismayed many clients as alterations

during construction raised their costs, it never fazed Wright, for “to him the process of

construction was a process of refinement as well.”206 A former student of Wright’s recalled that

“he always changed everything. A perpetual state of flux. ‘The last change is made when the

boom comes down,’ he’d snort.”207 Wright explained his attitude more gently when a client

complained to him of the delays, and expenses, that resulted from Wright’s constant changes

during the construction of one of his most important projects: “You see the building grows as it

is built and is none too easy, therefore, to keep up with always.”208

       Wright came to be considered as the leading modern architect for the innovative work he
                                                  48


produced during 1890-1910, but during the next two decades he was eclipsed by a number of

younger European architects, including Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe. By the time of

the Depression he had few clients, not only because of the economic climate but because, then

past the age of 60, Wright was felt to be out of date. When the Pittsburgh department store owner

E. J. Kaufmann approached Wright to design his weekend house near a stream at Bear Run,

Wright seized the opportunity to make a bold statement that would revive his career. He

succeeded spectacularly.

       Wright’s design of Fallingwater drew heavily on his own earlier buildings, including

Robie House and his own home at Taliesin. Thus the house features his trademark terraces,

overhangs, rough stonework, and a variety of other features that had developed from the Prairie

Style. Yet true to his experimental nature, in his desire to outdo the leading European modern

architects Wright was also willing to borrow their major innovations. So from the work of Mies,

Gropius, Le Corbusier, Schindler, and Neutra, Wright took such prominent features of

Fallingwater as cantilevers, extensive use of concrete and glazing, and an overall Cubist plan.209

Wright used these innovations, however, for his own purposes - to underscore the superiority of

his own organic architecture over the rigidity of the severe functionalist style of the Europeans.

Thus a scholar recently observed that Fallingwater “used the modernist vocabulary of floating

planes, but everything about it contradicted the functionalism of the style: its color, its definition

by and of the landscape, its framing of vistas from within, and its metaphorical interpretation of

human confrontation with nature, symbolically summed up in the stairs that descend from the

living room to the water. Each material - stone, glass, concrete - was assigned a function, yet

each was consonant with the site over a waterfall.”210
                                                 49


       Fallingwater drew on the full experience of Wright’s five decades as an architect. He first

visited Bear Run in December, 1934, but did not produce his first known plans for the house

until September of the next year. Before presenting these plans to the client Wright made at least

three, and perhaps four, visits to the site. In a recent study Franklin Toker concluded that the

traditional story that Wright drew his first plans for Fallingwater in just a few hours, on the

morning of September 22, 1935, as E. J. Kaufmann drove from Milwaukee to Taliesin, is

probably a myth, and that he had likely made drawings for his own use before that date.211 Toker

observed that Fallingwater contains two dramatic features that above all others made it famous -

the visual illusion that the stream actually runs through the house, and the extension of the upper

balcony beyond the one below it. Toker’s study of Wright’s drawings of the plans for the house

led him to conclude that one of these, the oversailing balcony, was not part of the plan Wright

initially drew on September 22, but that at some point that morning “he erased its original

parapet line and set a new one 19 feet farther out, which made the upper balcony oversail the

living room by 6 feet.” The effect was striking: “Fallingwater now took on a totally new image,

with the famous crisscross of its two main balconies.”One of Fallingwater’s most famous

features, which “defies all structural and functional logic,” was thus an improvisation that Wright

added after nine months of study of the project. Nor did Wright’s changes cease with his

construction drawings. In June of 1936, for example, with construction of Fallingwater already

under way, from Taliesin Wright sent new plans that changed the shape of the three massive

concrete bolsters that served as the building’s main source of support - several days after the

bolsters had been poured. Wright’s assistant who was supervising construction promptly “tore

down the just-completed bolsters and helped construct a new set in late July. Wright was
                                                 50


determined to give Fallingwater a thrilling profile, whatever the cost.”212

       Fallingwater became the focus of a great flood of publicity, including feature articles in

hundreds of newspapers and magazines, and an unprecedented exhibit devoted to the house at

New York’s Museum of Modern Art. It quickly became “the most famous private house in the

world.”213 Wright also received “the biggest PR boost of his career, and the perfect vehicle to

hype his comeback,” in the form of a special issue of Architectural Forum devoted to the

architect, “which has no rival as the most famous issue of any architectural magazine in any

language.”214

       Wright’s success was the result of producing a bold and dramatic design that synthesized

major elements of his own past art with key innovations from the work of his leading European

rivals, all in the service of his own organic principles: hovering over two waterfalls, and

anchored among three large boulders, Fallingwater was an unmistakable example of the

integration of modern architecture and nature. Approaching the age of 70, Wright produced “the

most complex house of the twentieth century” through an extended and painstaking experimental

process that drew on his vast working experience and mature aesthetic judgment.215

       In a recent survey of 40 textbooks of art history, two works were found to be tied for the

distinction of being reproduced more often than any others made by American artists during the

1980s. One of these was Tilted Arc, executed in 1981 by the sculptor Richard Serra, who was

then 42 years old and widely recognized as one of the most important living American artists.

The other was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated in 1982, which had been designed by

Maya Lin at the age of 21, during her senior year in college.216

       Lin originally made her design for the memorial as an assignment in an architecture
                                                  51


seminar she took at Yale. After thinking about the purpose of the memorial, she wanted to see

the site, so Lin and a few friends traveled to Washington, D. C. She later recalled that “it was at

the site that the idea for the design took shape”:

                       I had a simple impulse to cut into the earth.
                       I imagined taking a knife and cutting into the earth,
              opening it up, an initial violence and pain that in time would
              heal.217
Lin’s plan was to have two long walls of polished black granite, arranged in a V shape, placed in

the ground to form an embankment. One of the walls was to point to the Lincoln Memorial, the

other to the Washington Monument: “By linking these two strong symbols for the country, I

wanted to create a unity between the country’s past and present.”218 Lin realized that the strength

of her design lay in its simplicity:

                On our return to Yale, I quickly sketched my idea up, and it almost
                seemed too simple, too little. I toyed with adding some large flat
                slabs that would appear to lead into the memorial, but they didn’t
                belong. The image was so simple that anything added to it began to
                detract from it.219

        After Lin had completed her design, she decided to enter it in the national competition for

the veterans memorial. She found that the most difficult part of the entry was producing a one-

page description of the project: “It took longer, in fact, to write the statement that I felt was

needed to accompany the required drawings than to design the memorial.”220 Lin explained that

the description was “critical to understanding the design,” because the Memorial reflected her

conceptual approach to art. Lin’s artistic goals are explicitly ideational:

                Each of my works originates from a simple desire to make people
                aware of their surroundings, not just the physical world but also the
                psychological world we live in.221

The Memorial prominently features the carved names of all the soldiers killed or missing in
                                                 52


Vietnam, reflecting Lin’s belief that “writing is the purest of art forms... Words can be the most

direct means of sharing our thoughts.”222 The resemblance of the walls of the Memorial to an

open book is not accidental, as Lin explained that “the memorial is analogous to a book in many

ways.”223 In creating art, Lin generally begins with words:

                       I begin by imagining an artwork verbally. I try to describe
               in writing what the project is, what it is trying to do. I need to
               understand the artwork without giving it a specific materiality or
               solid form. I try not to find the form too soon. Instead, I try to think
               about it as an idea without a shape.224

The most important thing is to begin with a good concept: “a simple clear idea or moment of

inspiration is the soul of the piece.” The Memorial satisfied this criterion, for it “was born of an

instantaneous idea to cut open the earth.”225

       Architectural projects are inevitably collaborative, for architects must consider the wishes

of clients. Any collaboration can require compromises and deviations from an architect’s original

plans, but the potential for interference with Lin’s design was enormous because of the public

role of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the many controversies that still surround the

Vietnam War. Thus even after her design was chosen by an eight-person selection committee, it

had to go through an extended process of review by government agencies and public scrutiny, in

the course of which many strenuous objections were raised, by Vietnam veterans and others, to

the non-representational nature of Lin’s model. In an eventual compromise, a sculpture of three

male soldiers was placed some distance from Lin’s monument, and later a sculpture of three

female figures and a wounded soldier was also placed further away. Yet when the Memorial was

dedicated in the fall of 1982, Lin found it did reflect her original intention: “the place was

frighteningly close to what it should be.”226
                                                53


       Lin’s design was a radical departure from earlier memorial architecture, for the Memorial

was influenced much more strongly by Minimalist sculpture than by traditional memorials. Her

use of abstract forms initially shocked veterans and others who had expected a realistic portrayal

of soldiers in combat, which would explicitly pay tribute to their heroism and patriotism. Yet

when the Memorial was completed, it quickly came to be recognized as a moving tribute to the

soldiers who had died in Vietnam. Today it is not only the most visited memorial in the capital,

but it is widely considered to have established a new level of excellence for memorial

architecture. So for example when the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation held a

competition for a memorial to the victims of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, Maya

Lin was appointed to the five member jury. When the eight final designs were presented to the

public, the architecture critic for the New Yorker remarked that although all of these were

intelligent and sophisticated, they received a lukewarm reaction from critics and the public

because “in the post-Vietnam-memorial age, we may have come to expect too much of a

memorial.” The problem was that Lin had set a new standard: “Lin’s Vietnam memorial set the

bar very high.”227

       In the two decades since she designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Lin has pursued a

career as a architect and sculptor. A recent profile observed that “Now a beneficiary of a stream

of commissions, this still-young master is riding her good fortune, turning out institutional and

private projects while also making the individual sculptures to which she attaches such

importance.”228 Yet the survey of textbooks found no other work by Lin reproduced in even a

single book.229 Thus from the vantage point of art scholars Lin’s contribution consists of a single

work, that one scholar describes as “one of the most compelling monuments in the United
                                                54


States.”230 That a 21-year-old artist could conceive an idea that would be fully expressed in one

enormously successful project, and that would be followed by no others deemed significant by

art scholars, is a quintessentially conceptual phenomenon. Unlike the aging Frank Lloyd Wright,

who worked surrounded by assistants and apprentices at an academy dedicated to making his art,

the young Maya Lin worked alone: the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was first given solid form in

mashed potatoes at her college dining hall.231 And unlike Wright’s extended and painstaking

revisions, the Memorial “was born of an instantaneous idea.”232 These features of Lin’s method,

and the success of her design, may all have been consequences of her youth and lack of

experience. As one of the jurors for the competition commented on seeing Lin’s unorthodox

entry, the architect “must really know what he is doing to dare to do something so naive.”233

Movie Directors

               Q: During the shooting [of Citizen Kane], did you have the
               sensation of making such an important film?
               Welles: I never doubted it for a single instant.
                                                      Interview with Orson Welles,
                                                      1964234

               I do think that there is an art to the making of a motion picture.
               There are some great artists in the business. I am not one of them.
                                                       John Ford, 1973235

There is remarkably widespread agreement that Citizen Kane is the most important American

movie ever made. Thus for example Citizen Kane ranked first in a “definitive selection of the

100 greatest American movies of all time,” as determined by a poll of more than 1,500 members

of the American film community conducted in 2000 by the American Film Institute.236 Citizen

Kane also placed first in a ranking of the 100 best films of the 20th century compiled by The

Village Voice from a poll the newspaper conducted of 50 distinguished film critics. The
                                                55


screenplay for Citizen Kane similarly ranked first in a 2001 survey of the members of the Writers

Guild of America.237 Nor is Kane’s fame limited to the United States. Once every decade, the

British film magazine Sight & Sound conducts an international poll of critics and directors to

determine the 10 best movies ever made. Citizen Kane placed first in this poll in 1962, and

repeated this success in every subsequent decennial poll, including the most recent one in

2002.238 When Sight & Sound recently reprinted a paperback edition of Pauline Kael’s book on

the making of Citizen Kane, titled Raising Kane, the only print on the book’s front cover read

“Pauline Kael on the best film ever made.”239 Francois Truffaut recalled the enormous impact of

Citizen Kane: “This film has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any

other.”240 Among the most celebrated facts about Citizen Kane is that it was directed and

coauthored by the boy-wonder Orson Welles, who also played the title role, when he was just 25

years old. It was Welles’ first film.

       The importance of Citizen Kane derived in large part from its technical virtuosity. So for

example a recent survey of film history explained its contribution:

               It enabled the spectator not only to look through the frame at a
               make-believe world, but to see once again, so to speak, the frame
               as a constructed image... [N]o single aspect of Citizen Kane was
               entirely original or unknown to filmmakers, but the work’s
               startling impact came from its total effect, the concentration,
               comprehensiveness, and unity of its stylistic effort... Welles strove
               with his collaborators to utilize multiple innovations in nearly
               every shot and scene throughout the whole film.241

Citizen Kane’s technical sophistication was not accidental, but was a result of exceptionally

careful planning. Both the film’s composer and its photographer emphasized that they were

given exceptional amounts of time to plan and achieve the novel aims they and Welles had
                                                56


formulated. Thus Bernard Herrmann wrote that he and Wells agreed that “the dynamics of all

music in the picture should be planned ahead of time.” Contrary to the normal Hollywood

procedure in which musical scores were not written until filming was completed, Herrmann was

given time to write his score before filming began, and was then allowed to work on the film as it

was being shot and edited. In a number of scenes, film sequences were actually tailored to match

the music. Herrmann observed of the completed movie that “the result is an exact projection of

the original ideas in the score.”242 Similarly, Gregg Toland explained that “the photographic

approach to Citizen Kane was planned and considered long before the first camera turned.” This

allowed Toland time not only to formulate novel plans, but to make extensive experiments with

equipment and sets to make the plans possible. In this he had Welles’ full support: “Orson

Welles was insistent that the story be told most effectively, letting the Hollywood conventions of

movie-making go hang if need be.” Toland credited Welles for the opportunity: “Such

differences as exist between the cinematography in Citizen Kane and the camera work on the

average Hollywood product are based on the rare opportunity provided me by Orson Welles,

who was in complete sympathy with my theory that the photography should fit the story.”243

       The meticulous planning of Welles and his collaborators produced a movie that contained

many innovations involving both sound and sight. A number of the sound innovations reflected

Welles’ earlier experience in radio. These included musical bridges - the introduction of music in

the middle of a scene, to change the mood and foreshadow the transition to the next scene; sound

montages - series of short bursts of speech, that revealed the reactions of a number of characters

in quick succession; and overlapping dialogue tracks that mimicked the interruptions of real

conversation, with variation in sound levels that allowed one voice to be heard at a time. The
                                                57


visual innovations in Citizen Kane have become even more famous. A number of these were

used to attain what Toland called “human-eye focus,” with much greater depth of field than

movies normally afforded. Contributing to this was the staging, with construction of

exceptionally deep sets, so the action of a scene could occur simultaneously at different distances

from the camera; the use of extremely wide-angle lenses, with high-speed films, and very high

levels of illumination, which allowed sharp focus throughout the deep space of the sets, and

often created the startling effect of having important action in the background; and long camera

takes that allowed greater freedom of movement and extended ensemble acting for the players.

The greater realism produced by the novel device of building ceilings over the sets also

permitted the dramatic low-angle shots that became one of the movie’s technical trademarks.

       Citizen Kane became celebrated for its many innovative technical devices, but Welles’

greatest achievement probably lay in the integration of these many devices in the service of the

film’s story.244 The dramatic use of chiaroscuro in lighting, the fragmentation of the film’s action

in physical depth, staccato bursts of spoken words, and many other technical effects all served to

underscore the symbolic content of the film. Jorge Luis Borges recognized this when he

observed that Citizen’s Kane’s subject is “the discovery of the secret soul of a man,” and

explained that “In astonishing and endlessly varied ways, Orson Welles exhibits the fragments of

the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine and reconstruct them.”245 The

variety of technical means used to tell the story parallels the variety of views of Kane presented

by different characters, which evolved from the original idea motivating the film: thus Welles

recalled that the story of Kane began with “the idea of telling the same thing several times - and

showing exactly the same scene from wholly different points of view. Basically, the idea
                                                 58


Rashomon used later on.”246

       Welles’ conceptual approach to making movies is reflected in his emphasis on the

primacy of dialogue over images or action. Thus in a 1964 interview he declared: “I know that in

theory the word is secondary in cinema but the secret of my work is that everything is based on

the word. I do not make silent films. I must begin with what the characters say. I must know

what they say before seeing them do what they do.”247 For Welles, a good script was necessary

for a good film: “I’m sure I can’t make good films unless I also write the screenplay.”248

       Citizen Kane is a conceptual masterpiece, a great early work executed by an important

conceptual innovator. It dominates Welles’ career. Thus Gerald Mast observed that “unlike

Hitchcock, Lubitsch, Chaplin, Hawks, or Ford, whose reputations rest on a great number of

impressive films, critical respect for Orson Welles rests primarily on one film, Citizen Kane.”249

Andrew Sarris stressed the allegorical nature of the film: “Kane develops two interesting themes:

the debasement of the private personality of the public figure, and the crushing weight of

materialism. Taken together, these two themes comprise the bitter irony of an American success

story that ends in futile nostalgia, loneliness, and death.”250 Francois Truffaut recognized that

Welles had achieved what all young directors hope to do: “To shoot Citizen Kane at twenty-five

years of age, is this not the dream of all the young habitués of the cinematheques?”251

       A great deal of critical energy has been devoted to explaining how a young director could

produce such a great masterpiece as his first movie. Although Welles had no prior experience as

a film director, he had behind him a great deal of experience, and success, as an actor and

director in the theater and radio: as Truffaut put it, Kane is “the only first film made by a man

who was already famous.” For Truffaut, the movie bore witness to Welles’ iconoclasm: “Wells,
                                                 59


with extraordinary arrogance, had rejected the rules of cinema, the limits of its powers of

illusion.”252 Citizen Kane drew liberally on the expertise Welles had acquired in the other arts.

Peter Bogdanovich reflected that “Citizen Kane is like watching a consummate artist grappling

for the first time with the intoxication of his found vocation. All his passions - theatre, magic,

circus, radio, painting, literature - suddenly fused into one... No other director discovering the

medium was as ready or as mature.”253 Pauline Kael stressed the importance of an attitude in

Welles that Bernard Herrmann and Gregg Toland had both described: “He was young and open...

Welles was so eager to try out new ideas that even the tough, hardened studio craftsmen were

caught up by his spirit, just as his co-workers in the theatre and in radio had been.”254 Welles

himself had a slightly different explanation. When asked where he’d gotten the confidence to

make such a major effort so young, he replied: “Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance - you

know there’s no confidence to equal it. It’s only when you know something about a profession, I

think, that you’re timid or careful.”255

       Many movie critics consider John Ford to have been a great director. In 1973, when the

American Film Institute established its Life Achievement Award to honor individuals “whose

talent has, in a fundamental way, advanced the film art, and whose accomplishments have been

acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers, and the general public,” the first award

was given to Ford. The Institute’s citation declared that “No individual has more fully explored

on film the American experience.”256 Ford has been the subject of monographs not only by the

distinguished critic Andrew Sarris, but also by the directors Lindsay Anderson and Peter

Bogdanovich. Anderson considered that Ford was “probably the greatest film director working in

the world’s richest film making tradition.” 257When Orson Welles was asked which American
                                                 60


directors he most admired, he replied “the old masters. By which I mean John Ford, John Ford

and John Ford.”258

        Ford directed more than 140 movies, and won six Oscars. Curiously, however, no one of

his movies has emerged clearly as a masterpiece. No Ford film was ranked among the top 20

American movies of all time in the American Film Institute’s survey conducted in 2000, and

only three of his films were ranked in the top 100. The Institute’s citation for Ford’s Life

Achievement Award did not mention any specific movie, but instead referred collectively to

Ford’s films as “a creative tapestry representing over 50 years of work.”259 Although there is

considerable disagreement even among Ford’s admirers over what constitutes his best work, a

number of experts have named The Searchers as his greatest achievement. So for example John

Baxter called it “Ford’s most perfect philosophical statement,” and Gerald Peary considered it

“the pinnacle of Ford’s cinematic accomplishment.”260 Ford directed The Searchers in 1956, at

the age of 62.261

        That Ford may have been a master without a masterpiece and that his work was excellent

late in his career both appear to have been consequences of the fact that his approach to art was

experimental. Ford’s work is consistently praised for its visual qualities. Alfred Hitchcock stated

that “A John Ford film was a visual gratification.”262 Elia Kazan declared that Ford “taught me to

tell it in pictures.”263 Orson Welles made a similar statement when asked how he learned his

visual style:

                I’ve only been influenced by somebody once: prior to making
                Citizen Kane I saw [Ford’s] Stagecoach forty times. I didn’t need
                to learn from somebody who had something to say, but from
                somebody who would show me how to say what I had in mind;
                and John Ford is perfect for that.264
                                                                  61



Federico Fellini stressed Ford’s direct appeal to another one of the senses: “When I think of

Ford, I sense the smell of barracks, of horses, of gunpowder.”265

       Ford’s films are known for their stories and for ensemble acting. Thus a recent history of

film cited Ford as “a good example of the studio director who defined himself over a long career

by way of story and performance. It is possible to speak of a kind of Fordian world... peopled by

a repertory group of players.”266 Unlike Welles, Ford did not consider the script to be a critical

determinant of the quality of a movie. Thus he explained that “After all, you’ve got to tell your

story through the people who portray it. You can have a weak, utterly bad script - and a good

cast will turn it into a good picture.”267 Gerald Mast observed that “Ford’s method emphasized

visual images rather than talk,” and Ford agreed, stating that “Pictures, not words, should tell the

story.”268 On another occasion Ford elaborated on his philosophy:

               When a motion picture is at its best, it is long on action and short
               on dialogue. When it tells its story and reveals its characters in a
               series of simple, beautiful, active pictures, and does it with as little
               talk as possible, then the motion picture medium is being used to
               its fullest advantage.269

       Ford’s goal was to achieve immediacy and realism: “I try to make people forget they’re

in a theatre. I don’t want them to be conscious of a camera or a screen. I want them to feel what

they’re seeing is real.”270 He distrusted not only extensive dialogue but also complex technical

devices: “I like, as a director and a spectator, simple, direct, frank films. Nothing disgusts me

more than snobbism, mannerism, technical gratuity... and, most of all, intellectualism.”271

Lindsay Anderson remarked that Ford achieved a wide range of emotional effects through

technical mastery, but that he never allowed technique to obtrude on narrative: “Ford remains
                                                 62


always a story-teller.”272

       Although Ford began directing movies at the age of 23, his early work was

undistinguished. Thus Andrew Sarris commented that if Ford’s career had ended in 1929 - when

he was 35, and had already directed more than 65 films - “he would deserve at most a footnote in

film history.”273 Like that of other experimental artists, Ford’s work developed gradually, and

with considerably continuity: Peter Bogdanovich remarked that “Every Ford movie is filled with

reverberations from another - which makes his use of the same players from year to year, decade

to decade, so much more than just building ‘a stock company’ - and one film of his cannot really

be looked at as separate from the rest.”274 Ford is widely considered to have improved his work

until late in his life. Andrew Sarris judged that “the last two decades of his career were his

richest and most rewarding.”275 Similarly, Peter Bogdanovich considered Ford’s late films his

best, “not only in execution but in depth of expression.”276

       The explanation of why Ford’s work improved as he aged may be the same as the answer

he himself gave when asked how he chose where to place his cameras: “You shoot what would

look best on the screen. Experience, instinct. That’s it.”277 Andrew Sarris considered The

Searchers a stylistic summation of “all the best of what Ford had been,” and emphasized its

beauty: “The Searchers is rich in all the colors and textures of the seasons and the elements, from

the whiteness of winter snows to the brownness of summer sands.”278 Sarris believed that Ford’s

experience was the key to his late achievements: “The economy of expression that Ford has

achieved in fifty years of film-making constitutes the beauty of his style.”279

Young Geniuses and Old Masters

               There is, it seems, a graph of creativity which can be plotted
                                                                  63


               through an artist’s career.
                                                       Sir Alan Bowness, 1989280

       This consideration of important contributions made either very early or very late in an

artist’s career in seven different artistic disciplines demonstrates not only that there are dramatic

differences in basic characteristics of the work of conceptual and experimental innovators, but

also that there are significant similarities within each of these categories across disciplines.

       Conceptual innovators historically have been those artists most often described as

geniuses, as their early manifestations of brilliance have been taken to indicate that these

individuals were born with extraordinary talents. Conceptual innovators normally make their

most important contributions to a discipline not long after their first exposure to it. These early

innovators are often perceived as irreverent and iconoclastic. Among the cases examined here,

Kosuth, Rimbaud, Boccioni, and Jarry offer examples of artists whose lack of respect for, or lack

of interest in, earlier work in their disciplines figured prominently in their ability to make bold

new departures from existing practices. Conceptual innovations are often very simple. Although

Kosuth, Boccioni, and Lin had not spent long periods of time acquiring the complex skills

common to many practitioners of their disciplines, the radical simplifications they made in their

art allowed them to avoid the need for those skills. Kosuth, Rimbaud, Boccioni, Jarry, and Lin all

shared the extremely rapid formation of ideas that characterizes many conceptual innovations, as

the central elements of their major contributions arrived in brief moments of inspiration.

Conceptual innovations often involve radical leaps, producing work that not only does not

resemble other artists’ work, but equally does not resemble the innovator’s own earlier work. All

seven major conceptual innovations considered here share this characteristic, as in each case the
                                                  64


specific work examined marked a sharp discontinuity in the career of the artist. A consequence

of the sudden declaration of conceptual innovations together with their radical nature is their

frequent landmark status. In six of the seven cases considered here, the work examined in this

paper clearly dominates the innovator’s career. Thus the mention of Kosuth, Fitzgerald,

Boccioni, Jarry, Lin, or Welles immediately brings to mind a single trademark work. Perhaps

most fundamentally, this examination of seven major conceptual contributions underscores the

certainty of these important conceptual innovators. All seven of the artists had great confidence

in the validity and significance of their innovations, and this allowed them to put forward radical

contributions early in their careers in spite of their knowledge that many, if not most,

practitioners of their disciplines would be hostile to their ideas.

       Experimental innovators are most often praised for their wisdom and judgment. All the

experimental innovations examined here are considered prime examples of superb

craftsmanship, the result of experience acquired over the course of long careers by their creators.

All seven experimental innovators considered here are celebrated for their deep understanding

and respect for the traditions of their disciplines. With the exception of Wright’s Fallingwater,

the major works considered here were not intended as definitive statements, but were instead

provisional, subject to later modification or further development, reflecting their author’s lack of

certainty in their accomplishment. It is this uncertainty that is the most basic common

characteristic of these great experimental innovators. Bishop, Rodin, Ibsen, Wright, and Ford all

continued beyond the specific contributions examined here, progressively modifying their

innovations in later works through further experimentation; Mondrian and Dostoevsky were

prevented from doing this only by death. The work of these experimental innovators not only
                                                  65


makes explicit statements of uncertainty and ambiguity, but in some cases has implicit

expressions of uncertainty built into its fabric. Notable examples of this include the irregular

brushstrokes of Mondrian’s late paintings and Dostoevsky’s innovation of the polyphonic novel.

       This paper’s examination of seven major conceptual innovators has interesting

implications for a familiar problem that has previously been considered almost exclusively in

relation to one artist at a time, of why some important artists decline precipitously after making a

great early contribution. Some conceptual artists become tied to an early important innovation,

and produce later work that effectively repeats it in subject or technique. Jarry is an extreme

example of an artist who became the captive of his early achievement, but to a lesser degree

Kosuth, Lin, and Welles all revisited their early innovations in their later work. In some cases a

conceptual innovator loses the power of his early approach by aiming to produce later works that

are more complex. Kosuth and Lin have both made later contributions that are more involved but

less influential than their early masterpieces, and the failure of Tender is the Night to match the

importance of The Great Gatsby is probably due to Fitzgerald’s attempt to write a more complex

novel. In each of these cases, the artist’s decline appears to have been a consequence of the

failure to recognize that the key to the success of an early landmark contribution lay in its

simplicity. In yet other cases, a brilliant conceptual innovator may lose interest in his discipline.

It is often difficult to determine whether this plays a role in the career of a particular innovator,

but among the most dramatic instances of it is surely Rimbaud’s definitive decision to abandon

poetry at the age of 19.

       This paper clearly demonstrates the generality of the distinction between conceptual and

experimental innovators in artistic disciplines. In a wide range of very different activities it is
                                               66


readily apparent that some artists are conceptual, and others experimental. Examination of their

contributions furthermore allows us to understand why it is that important conceptual

innovations are generally made by the young, and major experimental contributions by the old.
