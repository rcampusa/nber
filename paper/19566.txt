                                               ABSTRACT

To moderate the rate of growth of retiree health insurance costs, employers can modify plans and move
retirees into less expensive plans. We examine policy modifications implemented by the North Carolina
State Health Plan. We investigate whether incentives produce the desired plan elections and whether
these changes, along with cost shifting, produce the expected reductions in cost growth. Using individual-level
administrative data, along with aggregated data on expenditures for retirees, we estimate the effects
of the introduction and subsequent repeal of a Comprehensive Wellness Initiative for non-Medicare
eligible retirees, as well as increases in coinsurance and copayments and the introduction of a premium
for all retirees. Over a third of non-Medicare retirees shifted into the least generous plan between
June 2009 and December 2012. The level effects on annual costs and unfunded accrued liabilities
were relatively modest, but growth rates were diminished. Increases in the retiree premiums reduced
projected costs.

      I.      Introduction

           Most state and local government employers allow retirees to continue to be enrolled in

their employee health plans.1 While retiree health insurance (RHI) is common in the public

sector, this benefit has been rapidly disappearing in the private sector.2 Important factors that

influence firms to eliminate this benefit include the continuing rapid increase in the cost of

health insurance coupled with the aging of the population and increasing longevity of retirees

(which results in more retirees relative to active workers and increases the total cost). The

decline in private sector coverage of RHI also coincided with the issuance of new standards by

the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 1989 that required firms to acknowledge unfunded

liabilities associated with these plans on their balance sheets (FASB, 1989). After FAS 106,

employers were forced to properly value the cost of this benefit, and many chose to eliminate

their RHI plan after this.

           Public sector employers are now facing the same cost pressures as private employers

and, in response, have been adopting policies in an effort to limit the cost associated with

providing RHI. In 2004, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.

45 requiring public employers to also acknowledge the unfunded liabilities associated with RHI

plans for public employees (GASB, 2004). In the public sector, accounting is less important

than cash flow, and so, for the most part, the new accounting standards did not lead to a

substantial decline in RHI coverage in the public sector.




1   Franzel and Brown (2013) report that between 2002 and 2006, 92 to 96 percent of state government
units offered health insurance to their retirees under age 65. There has been a substantial decline in the
incidence of retiree health insurance after 2005 and the proportion of state governmental units with
retiree health insurance fell to 69 percent in 2011.

2   Kaiser Family Foundation (2012) reports that only 25 percent of firms with 200 or more workers that
offer health benefits to their active employees extend this coverage to retirees. This is down from 66
percent in 1988.


                                                       2
          A retiree’s choice of health plan could affect her economic well-being both through

annual out-of-pocket costs and through exposure to the risk of a high-cost health event. Most

public employers offer workers the choice of several different types of health insurance plans. In

many states, workers can choose from HMOs, PPOs, indemnity plans, and consumer-driven

high deductible plans. Even when a state offers only one type of plan, employees and retirees

usually are able to select among several options within the plan type. The plan options typically

differ in the premium the retiree must pay, the level of deductibles and co-payments, and the

percentages of co-insurance payments. Employers may attempt to reduce costs by providing

incentives (either subsidies or penalties), in an effort to reduce costs and shift retirees into less

generous plans.

          While most public employers continue to offer RHI as an employee benefit, plan

modifications that shift cost to the retiree have the potential to degrade the promised benefit.3

On the other hand, for the provision of RHI to be sustainable, plan modifications and cost

shifting can be an avenue to reduce costs and shore-up the long-term viability of this benefit.

Public sector employers facing large unfunded RHI liabilities might otherwise have to raise

taxes and/or reduce spending on other priorities in order to provide this expensive employee

benefit (for a discussion, see Clark and Morrill 2010, 2011).

          Large unfunded liabilities associated with employer-provided RHI, and the continued

existence of these plans, has driven the need and desire for plan reforms in many states (Franzel

and Brown 2013). To date, there has been little systematic assessment of the impact of policy

changes on these plans and the benefits they provide to retirees. This analysis provides a unique

evaluation of how retirees respond to efforts to shift workers from higher cost to lower costs

3   Franzel and Brown (2013) report that in each of the past three years, over 60 percent of state
governments responding to a survey had made changes in the health benefits offered to employees and
retirees with 31 percent stating that they had shifted more health care costs from the employer to retirees
by raising premiums, copayments, and/or increasing deductibles. In addition, the states have been
increasing the age of eligibility and years of service required in order to vest in the retiree health plans.

plans through wellness programs and premiums. The study uses data on retired teachers and

state employees in North Carolina’s State Health Plan (SHP).4

            The plan has made a series of policy changes that have produced substantial movement

between the two PPOs currently offered by the state. Using monthly enrollment data and

administrative records from July 2009 through December 2012, we track the movements

between plans as two wellness programs are adopted and then removed and a premium is added

to the Standard Plan. We explore the characteristics of retirees who change plans. In addition,

we assess the impact of the policy changes and varying plan choices on the annual cost of the

state health plan and the unfunded liability of the retiree health plan. The key finding of the

analysis is that policy changes such as the implementation of comprehensive wellness programs

resulted in a substantial shift of non-Medicare retirees across types of PPOs. At the same time,

Medicare-eligible retirees, who were not affected by the first set of policy changes, remained in

their preferred plan. Despite this large shift in plan choice among non-Medicare retirees, the

resulting contemporaneous cost savings was modest in levels. However, the evidence suggests

that cost growth was moderated. Additionally, increases in retiree-paid premiums and other

forms of cost-shifting did reduce the long term costs to the state associated with RHI.

      II.      Background on the North Carolina State Health Plan (SHP)

            The North Carolina State Health Plan (SHP) is self-funded and covers all public school

teachers and state employees, including both active and retired workers. As in many states, the

rapidly escalating cost of this employee benefit threatens to swamp the state budget as health

care expenditures grow faster than state revenues.5 Until September 2011, public sector



4   In North Carolina, the State Health Plan (SHP) offers exactly the same benefits to active and retired
state employees and teachers, with the exception that when retirees reach age 65 they must enroll in
Medicare which becomes their primary insurer.

5   GAO (2011) predicts that in the United States state and local government expenditures on health care,
including both Medicaid programs and the provision of health insurance to active and retired workers,

                                                       4
employers in North Carolina paid the full cost of the premium for employees for all health plans

offered by the state, but the employees paid the full premium for dependent and family

coverage. Because of both escalating costs and large unfunded liabilities associated with the

retiree health plan, North Carolina has implemented several measures to moderate the growth

of health insurance costs for active and retired employees, including increasing cost-shifting and

implementing wellness initiatives. Over the time period studied, North Carolina implemented

several pilot studies of weight loss, exercise and nutrition, smoking cessation, and other

traditional wellness initiatives. Because these programs affected all SHP members, we chose to

focus our analysis on the impact of the large-scale Comprehensive Wellness Initiative, which

directly affected plan choice. North Carolina is a particularly interesting case to study because a

change in the political environment lead to the repeal of the Comprehensive Wellness Initiative

just 14 months after it was first implemented. At the same time, a premium on the more

generous plan was introduced, causing a large shift to the more basic plan offering. Thus, over a

two year span, the state implemented three major policy changes that affected their choice of a

health insurance plan. In the following analysis, we show that in response to the policy changes

over one third of retirees who were not eligible for Medicare shifted from one plan to the other.

          In North Carolina, public employees may continue their health insurance coverage in

retirement with the full cost of the premium paid by the state in at least one plan as long as some

specified minimum years of service requirement are met.6 The plan itself is generous in that the

full cost of the premium is covered for the employee/retiree. However, the plan also has

relatively high out-of-pocket costs and no subsidy for dependent coverage. Actuarial reports

will grow substantially faster than GDP. They argue that their simulations project a rise in health-related
costs that is (p. 4) “the root of the fiscal difficulties” faced by state and local governments nationally.

6   Retirees must be receiving a pension benefit from employment in North Carolina to be covered by the
health insurance plan. Workers hired after 2006 are subject to the following premium schedule based on
years of service: 5-9 years must pay full premium, 10-19 years must pay 50 percent of premium, and 20
or more years pay no premium. All retirees must still pay the full premium for dependent health.


                                                        5
produced in accordance with the GASB 45 rule indicate a large and growing liability associated

with these promised benefits. North Carolina is typical of most states with large unfunded

liabilities in that not only is the promised benefit generous, but little funds have been set aside to

meet this obligation and funding is generally “pay-as-you-go.” According to estimates in Clark

and Morrill (2011), North Carolina ranked fifth in unfunded actuarially accrued liability (UAAL)

levels and eighth in per capita UAAL among state employee retiree health plans.7

          The predecessor to the SHP was established in 1972 to provide health insurance to

teachers and state employees.8 Initially, the appropriation by the legislature for state employee

health insurance was not to exceed $10 per month for each employee. In 1974, the state began

allowing retired employees who were receiving a retirement annuity from the Teachers and

State Employees Retirement System to remain in the health plan. In the early years, the retiree

had to pay the full premium for health insurance coverage. In 1976, the state created a separate

insurance benefit for Medicare eligible retirees and began requiring retirees to enroll in

Medicare when they became eligible to do so. In 1978, the state appropriated sufficient funds to

pay the full premium for retirees, thus making retiree health insurance noncontributory.

          Today, the North Carolina SHP provides health insurance to active and retired teachers

and state employees and their spouses and dependents (hereafter we refer to children, spouse,

and family coverage as simply “dependent coverage”). The premium for dependent coverage is

calculated using a common risk pool for dependents of both active workers and retirees not yet

eligible for Medicare (hereafter non-Medicare retirees), so the price non-Medicare retirees must

pay is less than what would be typically found on the open market for health insurance prior to

Medicare eligibility. This potentially leads to adverse selection into the risk pool, since the

retirees with the highest costs will be those with the most to benefit from participating in the

7   Pew (2011) and Franzel and Brown (2012, 2013) both report similar levels of underfunding.

8   In North Carolina, most of the funds for salary and benefits for teachers are provided by the state, and
teachers and state employees are in the same pension plan and health insurance plans.

plan. Active and retired workers are subject to the same deductibles and co-payments and are

able to purchase dependent coverage, but the premium for dependent coverage does vary by

whether the individual and/or the dependents are eligible for Medicare. For simplicity we group

subscribers into two categories, Medicare-eligible retirees (hereafter Medicare retirees) and

non-Medicare retirees, based on the subscriber’s status.9

           Retired teachers and state employees meeting a minimum years of service requirement

are eligible to continue their participation in the SHP.10 When first introduced, retired

employees who were receiving a state retirement benefit (which required five years of service)

were eligible to continue receiving the state health insurance for the rest of their lives without

paying any premium for this coverage.11 Since the plan was implemented, the ratio of retirees to

workers increased, health care expenditures per person rose, and life expectancy increased. As

the magnitude of the cost of this employee benefit became more salient, state policy makers

began to focus on the escalating costs, especially for employees who had relatively short careers

with the state. In 2006, the state raised the eligibility requirement for all newly hired

employees.12 Since the change in eligibility standards applies only to persons hired after 2006,



9    Alternatively, one could also group by whether the subscriber covers dependents and whether any
dependents are eligible for Medicare. Employee premiums vary by dependents’ eligibility for Medicare,
but plan rules apply only to the subscriber’s status.

10   Upon becoming Medicare eligible, retirees must enroll in Medicare. Medicare becomes the primary
payer for these individuals, thus reducing the cost to the state of providing what becomes supplemental
health insurance.

11   The service requirements for RHI were quite minimal. For example, at that time, someone could have
worked for a local government that did not participate in the SHP for at least 5 years, then work for the
State for one month and get RHI indefinitely.

12   The years of service requirements for eligibility for those hired after 2006 are listed in footnote 4. The
first retirees covered by these new rules would have retired on October 1, 2011. Any individual hired prior
to 2006 was eligible for RHI as long as he/she is receiving a retirement benefit from the system and
worked at least five year in a job covered by the SHP.


                                                         7
the short term impact of this change has only a modest effect on current cost and the accrued

liabilities of the SHP.13

           The structure of the SHP is somewhat unique. A subscriber, who is either an active

employee or retiree of the State, has the option to cover dependents (children, spouse, or family

coverage). Until September 2011 the employer paid the full premium for the employee/retiree

for either the Standard or Basic Plan. The Standard Plan is identical or superior to the Basic

Plan along each dimension. Thus, a subscriber that is not covering dependents would have no

reason to voluntarily choose the Basic Plan prior to September 2011. However, the SHP

stipulates that the subscriber be in the same plan as his/her dependents. Employees/retirees

that cover dependents may therefore choose the less expensive Basic Plan so that the premiums

associated with dependent coverage are lower. All plans are Preferred Provider Organizations

(PPOs) administered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina.14

           Typically, the SHP plan is funded by the legislature in two year cycles, so that any

modifications to premiums or other plan design features would happen every other year and be

effective as of July 1 of an even numbered year.15,16 However, over the course of the time period


13   It is interesting to note that the General Assembly enacted the same change in eligibility requirements
for retiree health insurance in 1995 (SL1995-507). However, before these new standards could affect any
retirees, the legislature eliminated the new requirements and reestablished the old eligibility standards in
2000 (SL2000-184).

14   In the year prior to our data, the SHP was offering employees the choice of three plan options: the Basic
Plan with a 70/30 co-insurance split, the Standard Plan with 80/20 co-insurance split, and the Premium
plan with a 90/10 co-insurance split. The Premium Plan required the employee to pay a premium for
coverage, and as of July 2009 that plan was eliminated and subscribers in the Premium Plan were
defaulted into the Standard Plan. In June 2009 about 12 percent of retired subscribers were in the
Premium Plan (16,730 retirees). Of those, only 33 were in the Basic Plan in July 2009.

15   This is not a requirement, but in recent years the political process has been such that modifications
(typically benefit cuts) are only adopted in non-election years.

16   The 2009-2010 session of the NC General Assembly had a 68-52 Democratic majority in the House and
30-20 Democratic majority in the Senate with a 10-5 majority of Democrats on the Joint Committee on

                                                        8
studied, plan changes were implemented off-cycle because of the time needed to implement the

policy changes. The plan is self-funded with funds coming through employer and employee

contributions and state appropriations. Cost shortfalls are met with special funding allocated as

needed.17

           Table 1 summarizes the premiums that would be paid by the subscriber and his/her

employer under each regime between July 2009 and June 2013.18 Note that family coverage was

also available, so this list is not a complete set of premiums and plan options available to

retirees. The premiums also vary by whether the employee/retiree and his/her dependents are

eligible for Medicare. The most common combinations are presented in Table 1. Table 2

describes other important differences between the plans in terms of copayments and

coinsurance rates.

                                                      [Table 1]



Employee Hospital and Medical Benefits. For the 2011-2012 session, the Republicans gained the majority
in both chambers for the first time since 1870. During that session the House had a 68-52 Republican
majority and the Senate had a 31-19 Republican majority. Technically, the Joint Committee on Employee
Hospital and Medical Benefits still existed, but it only met once during the 2011-2012 session and did not
make any decisions. During that same session, control over the SHP was moved from the Joint
Committee to the Treasurer’s Office (the Treasurer, Janet Cowell, is a Democrat and won reelection in the
2012 elections) [see http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/Committees/Committees.asp]. The change in
management was made effective January 1, 2012. Substantial changes to plan offerings are currently
being developed and are planned to become effective January 1, 2014.

17   Since at least 1997, all premiums (employee, employer, and dependents) were increased by the same
percent regardless of the relative experience. There were only some minor exceptions to this, such as
when spousal coverage split off from family coverage and when the employee only premium was
introduced in 2011.

18   Nationally, the total cost of employee health premiums for state employees in 2009 averaged $474 with
employees paying an average of 8 percent of the total cost for individual coverage. Data from a survey by
the National Conference of State Legislatures found that in 2009 the average total premium for family
coverage was $1,062 with employees paying an average of 18 percent of the total premium (Cauchi,
2009).


                                                      9
                                                        [Table 2]

           Tables 1 and 2 illustrate that the Standard Plan dominates the Basic Plan along almost

every dimension. While the Standard Plan is clearly more generous than the Basic Plan, the

member out-of-pocket costs are high in both plans. Although there are clear differences in the

plans, both include high copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and dependent premiums.

           These two tables also illustrate the broad ways that the plan parameters were altered

over time. Table 3 provides a summary of the major plan modifications that occurred over the

time period of our study. The plan year begins in July. In general, open enrollment periods

allow workers to change plans starting in July. Workers and retirees must remain in the same

plan throughout the year unless there is a qualifying event that provides them with the

opportunity to shift plans.19

                                                        [Table 3]

           The Comprehensive Wellness Initiative (CWI) was phased-in over two open enrollment

periods, July 2010 and July 2011. In the first year, all non-Medicare retirees were defaulted to

the Basic Plan. The CWI did not apply to Medicare retirees, regardless of the Medicare-

eligibility of any covered dependents. Thus, all Medicare retirees were defaulted into their prior

plan selections. For non-Medicare retirees, in order to switch from the default Basic Plan to the

Standard Plan the subscriber had to attest that she was not a tobacco user and that no covered

dependents used tobacco products.20 The SHP provided tobacco cessation assistance and

members participating in a cessation program were allowed to join the Standard Plan.

           In July 2011, the second phase of the CWI went into effect. At this time, all non-

Medicare retirees were again defaulted into the Basic Plan, while Medicare retirees were not


19   Qualifying events include the birth of a child, employment status change of self or spouse, or a change in
marital status.

20   North Carolina is one of nine states that have established premium differentials for smokers; however,
39 states have instituted programs to help workers stop smoking (NCLS, 2011).


                                                       10
affected. Under CWI-II, the subscriber would have to attest both to not smoking and to not

being overweight (defined as having a BMI greater than 40) for him/herself and his/her

dependents. It should be noted that the SHP did stipulate that audits of individuals and their

behavior might be conducted, but in practice there were no tests actually conducted to make

sure individuals were in compliance. This is particularly important for retirees, who are not

present at a place of employment where smoking or weight could easily be measured or

observed.21

          Although the full CWI, including the BMI certification, was implemented for the July

2011 open enrollment period, it was quickly repealed. There was a second open enrollment

period for September 2011, which had been announced prior to July. Thus the response to CWI-

II may have been muted due to the announcement of the repeal. In September 2011, members

were defaulted into their July 2011 plan election but had the option of switching to any plan.

The CWI was repealed so there were no restrictions on who could choose the Standard Plan, but

at the same time a premium was introduced on the Standard Plan for subscribers. Following the

ACA rules to maintain “grandfathered” status, the employee’s share of the premium could only

be increased by 5 percent relative to the employee premium in the previous year. Because the

previous year’s premium was zero, the SHP imposed a premium that was slightly less than 5

percent of the total premium. At the same time, most copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance

maximums were increased by approximately 16 percent relative to July 2011.22


21   A tobacco testing plan was developed, but never implemented. The plan was to randomly select
subscribers who had attested they did not use tobacco and then test both the subscriber and his/her
spouse (if covered). Dependent children were not to be tested, even if over the age of 18. Because the rate
of enrollment was roughly equal to the estimated fraction of smokers in the SHP, the SHP felt that
members were mostly compliant and audits were not necessary [see minutes of the 8/31/2010 Board of
Trustees Meeting].

22   For dependent premiums, the new employee-only amount was added to the total premium for the
employee plus dependent coverage, resulting in an increase in premiums between 5% and 14% for
employee plus dependent coverage.

III. Retiree Plan Choices

          As predicted in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), prior research has found an important

role for adverse selection in plan choice, whereby the less healthy choose more generous plans

(e.g., Cutler, Lincoln, and Zeckhauser, 2010; Naessen et al., 2008; Tchernis, et al., 2006). In our

case, we instead explore how plan parameters affect plan choice, holding constant any time

invariant differences in individual health endowments through the use of subscriber fixed

effects. Furthermore, we consider plan choice in a unique environment where the relative

generosity of the plans is clear, but the choice of the less generous plan is going to be influenced

by defaults, inertia, and the wellness incentives as well. We also consider the introduction of a

premium on the more generous plan, with findings that confirm prior research. For example,

using data from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Atherly, Florence, and Thorpe

(2005) find that individuals are less likely to switch within PPO’s than managed care plans, but

individuals’ plan choices within PPO’s are responsive to premium increases.

III.A. Data and Descriptive Statistics

          Data used in the analysis on retirees’ choices between the two PPOs is derived from the

administrative records of the SHP record-keeper, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina.

The data include plan elections, status, and basic demographics (gender, birth year, employer,

and county) for all members for each month from July 2009 through December 2012, along

with a member identification code that allows individuals to be linked across periods and for

dependents to be linked to the subscriber.23 Unfortunately, the administrative records do not

indicate whether retirees were married or had dependents; we only observe the existence of

dependents if the subscriber selects to include them as part of their insurance election at some

time during our sample period. The sample is restricted to those who were 50 or older on


23   The data exclude any member (subscriber or dependent) who is age 90 or older. Thus, in addition to
missing some subscribers in the data, we may erroneously classify some older subscribers as having no
dependents.


                                                     12
January 1 of the observation year. Age is measured as observation year minus birth year minus

one. For this analysis, we collapsed the data to the subscriber-level and recorded whether the

subscriber was covering any dependents. As described above, any dependents must be in the

same plan as the subscriber. The final dataset includes 79,090 non-Medicare retirees and

126,506 Medicare retirees that appear in the data for at least one month during the time period

July 2009-December 2012.24 The analysis sample is at the subscriber-month level and includes

observations for each subscriber in every month in which he/she was a member; this results in

an unbalanced panel of plan choice in each month between July 2009 and December 2012. A

subscriber is only present in the data in the month-years in which he/she is retired. When the

data are expanded to subscriber-months, the final sample includes 2,122,969 non-Medicare

retiree-months and 4,323,064 Medicare retiree-months.

          Table 4 includes sample descriptive statistics, first for the full sample and then broken

out by Medicare-eligibility status. Because the CWI did not cover Medicare-eligible members, it

is not surprising to see so many fewer Medicare-eligible retirees are in the Basic Plan (as

opposed to the Standard Plan), on average. The age categories are broken out to highlight the

important time period when individuals first become eligible for Medicare. Although we only

observe year of birth, we can assume that those who were ages 64 or 65 on January 1 of the

given year are almost eligible or newly eligible for Medicare during any month that year.

           The bottom portion of Table 4 illustrates the substantial movement to the Basic Plan

between 2009 and the end of 2012. The first column presents averages across the entire sample,

while Column (2) includes only non-Medicare retirees and Column (3) includes only Medicare

retirees. This same data is presented in Figure 1, except the means are plotted monthly. We

24   The data were cleaned by dropping any duplicate observations and any observations where the age rose
by more than one year or dropped at all (1,347). We also dropped the less than one percent of the sample
that had age greater than 65 and was not eligible for Medicare. Note that while it is possible that someone
over age 65 does not qualify for Medicare, that it is unlikely in this setting and could otherwise potentially
distort the coefficients on age.


                                                      13
observe that CWI was associated with an enormous increase in Basic Plan enrollment among the

non-Medicare retirees, from 1.58% in July 2009 to 30.44% in July 2010. However, for Medicare

retirees, who were exempt from the CWI, we do not observe any such change over the two CWI

periods. The repeal of the CWI and concurrent introduction of the premium did not alter the

percent enrolled in the Basic Plan by much, although we see that the premium increase did lead

to a doubling of enrollment in the Basic Plan among the Medicare retirees and a slight drop

among the non-Medicare retirees. In Table 9 we explore whether equal proportions of non-

Medicare retirees switch into and out of the Basic Plan in September 2011, or whether plan

selection did not change for the vast majority of subscribers.

                                                       [Table 4]

                                                       [Figure 1]

           Before turning to the statistically analysis, we present additional figures that illustrate

some heterogeneity in response to the plan modifications. Figure 2 further disaggregates the

non-Medicare and Medicare groups into age categories. As health typically declines with age,

we would expect to see that younger subscribers are more likely to be in the Basic Plan than

older subscribers, all else equal. Indeed, in Figure 2 we see that the highest rate of Basic Plan

enrollment is among the non-Medicare retirees ages 50-59. Although the level of Basic Plan

enrollment is always lower than the 50-59 year olds, the age 60-64 non-Medicare retirees have a

similar jump in Basic Plan enrollment over the two CWI periods. The youngest Medicare

retirees, ages 64-69, are slightly more affected by the plan changes than their older peers, but

each Medicare retiree age group demonstrates a slight shift upward when the premium was

introduced on the Standard Plan.25



25   Age is measured as of January 1st of a given year. We divide the sample by Medicare-eligibility status,
but do not observe an individual’s exact age. So the Medicare retiree age 64-69 group will contain some
64 year olds that qualify for Medicare due to disability. Medicare retirees younger than age 64 are
excluded from Figure 2, but are included in the regression estimates presented below.


                                                       14
                                               [Figure 2]

       In Figure 3, we restrict the sample to non-Medicare retirees, who are most affected by

the plan changes. We consider whether the responsiveness to the plan changes varies by

whether or not the subscriber covers dependents. Prior to CWI, a retiree that does not cover

dependents would have no reason to enroll in the Basic Plan, since the full premium for the

Standard Plan was covered by the employer. Indeed, we see that prior to July 2010 basically no

non-Medicare retirees that had self-only coverage elected for the Basic Plan, while less than 10

percent of non-Medicare retirees with dependents elected for the Basic Plan. Interesting, the

two CWI periods were associated with similarly sized jumps in Basic Plan enrollment between

subscribers who covering dependents and those who were not. We observe that the CWI repeal

and premium introduction had a seemingly slightly larger effect on subscribers with

dependents. In Table 9, described below, we illustrate that the choice to cover dependents was

not affected by the plan modifications.

                                               [Figure 3]

       The plan data clearly indicate that these three policy changes produced a considerable

shift in enrollment patterns between the two plans. The following statistical analysis indicates

how changes vary across demographic characteristics of the retirees.

III.B. Regression Analysis of Plan Choice

       While Figures 1-3 and the means presented in Table 4 are suggestive of a large impact of

the CWI and premium among non-Medicare retirees, it is important to control for secular time

trends and seasonality, and potentially any sample composition changes. To assess the changes

in plan choice over time, we estimate the following LPM for retirees selecting the basic plan:

       (1)



Here Basic refers to the choice of the Basic Plan (opposed to the Standard Plan). The major

policy periods are CWI-I (July 2010-June 2011), CWI-II (July 2011-August 2011), and Repeal

                                                15
and Premium (September 2011 – December 2012). The omitted category is the baseline period

from July 2009 through June 2010. The specification includes dummy variables for male,

covering dependents in that month, and age categories 50-59 (reference group for the non-

Medicare retirees regressions), 60-63, 64-65 (becoming or recently transitioned to Medicare-

eligible), 66-69 (reference group for Medicare retirees regressions), 70-79, and 80 and older. All

regression specifications include month fixed effects to control for seasonality (open enrollment

is always in July, except for the second enrollment in 2011) and year fixed effects to control for

secular time trends, such as the aging of the population. Some specifications also include

subscriber fixed effects (μ), which controls for time invariant characteristics of individuals such

as underlying health, risk aversion, time preferences, etc.

       For the first two time periods, CWI-I and CWI-II, the Medicare retirees serve as a

“control” group for the plan modifications in a difference-in-differences type setting since

Medicare retirees were not affected by the Comprehensive Wellness Initiatives. However,

Medicare retirees were affected by introduction of the premium, albeit with a lower total out-of-

pocket expense since the premiums are substantially lower. We have chosen to estimate and

present the results for a pooled sample of retirees and then for non-Medicare retirees and

Medicare retirees separately, rather than estimate a full difference-in-differences model.

       Table 5 presents the results from estimating equation (1) first for all retirees and then for

non-Medicare and Medicare retirees separately. The even numbered columns include

subscriber fixed effects. We see that the plan modifications were associated with a large shift

into the Basic Plan on average, but this pattern only holds for the non-Medicare retirees when

disaggregated by Medicare eligibility status. Although the means indicated that the premium

increased enrollment in the Basic Plan by the Medicare retirees, once covariates are included in

the model the coefficient is small and negative. By including individual fixed effects in the even

numbered columns we control for any unobserved, time invariant health or socioeconomic

characteristics of the individual. Results are largely unchanged when subscriber fixed effects are

                                                 16
included, although the age patterns are affected since those effects are only identified off of

individuals who cross an age category boundary in a given year (recall that age is actually age on

January 1 of a given year, as calculated from year of birth).

                                                  [Table 5]

       Table 5, Columns (3) and (4) presents results for non-Medicare retirees only. Here we

see the plan modifications were associated with large increases in Basic Plan enrollment,

controlling for year, month, age, and dependent status. In Columns (5) and (6), we see that the

estimated coefficients on the plan modifications for the Medicare retirees are small and

negative. Interestingly, we do not see a large positive estimated coefficient on the introduction

of the premium for the Medicare retirees, suggesting that Medicare retirees were largely

unaffected by the premium increase, on average.

       The estimates in Table 5 pooled together those covering dependents (who had to pay

premiums throughout the sample period) and those who only had single coverage. In Table 6,

we consider the choice to be in the basic plan separately for those covering dependents or not.

These equations include subscriber, month, and year fixed effects. Perhaps surprisingly, in

Columns (1) and (2), we see that the effects of the policy changes are nearly identical for non-

Medicare retirees who cover dependents compared with those that do not. Similarly, in

Columns (3) and (4), we again see that on average the plan modifications did not substantially

alter the probability of being in the Basic Plan among Medicare retirees. The introduction of the

premium did lead to a small, positive increase in Basic Plan enrollment, but the point estimates

are small. Because there are not large differences by dependent coverage, we group together

those covering dependents and those that do not for the remainder of the empirical analysis.

                                                 [Table 6]

       Next, we consider the special case of individuals in their first month of eligibility.

Presumably, these individuals will not be as affected by a “default” and will instead actively be

choosing coverage when signing up for retiree health insurance. First, we consider individuals

                                                 17
in the first month they have the status non-Medicare retiree. Estimates are reported in the first

column of Table 7. The specification is identical to Table 5, Column 3, and includes month and

year fixed effects. The data include only one observation per subscriber, since we are observing

choice in the first month retired. Means of the dependent variable (signing up for the Basic

Plan) are reported in the bottom row of Table 7. When comparing the estimates with those in

Table 5, Column 4, we see that the newly non-Medicare retirees are less likely overall to be in the

Basic Plan (17.4% versus 25.3%) and that the various plan modifications have a smaller effect,

although the magnitude is still large relative to the mean. We see that the largest increase in the

probability of Basic Plan enrollment occurred because of the introduction of the premium on the

Standard Plan. This suggests that in the full sample, a substantial portion of subscribers simply

retained the default plan choice.

                                                 [Table 7]

       The second column of Table 7 includes individuals that are first observed in the data as

eligible for Medicare. Newly retired employees that are Medicare retirees had an overall sign-up

rate of 12.9% in the Basic Plan. Note that a small fraction of the sample reports ages below 65,

which may be due to eligibility for Medicare through disability. For this group we see basically

no impact of any plan modifications, except a small positive coefficient when the premium is

introduced. Interestingly, relative to those who begin retiree health insurance benefits between

the ages of 66-69, we see the largest probabilities of being in the Basic Plan for individuals

retiring between ages 60-65. The final column of Table 7 includes individuals who were non-

Medicare retirees in the prior month and become newly Medicare retirees in the current month.

This sample is restricted to those ages 64-65 on January 1 of the given year. Prior results would

suggest that the Medicare retirees would mostly opt for the Standard Plan, since they would only

be affected by the CWI if they covered non-Medicare eligible dependents. However, we see large

estimated coefficients for each of the plan changes, indicating that this group of retirees was

very much influenced by the plan modifications. This may be due to newly Medicare retirees

                                                 18
opting to stay in the Basic Plan due to inertia. One potential concern is that the composition of

retirees changes as a function of these plan modifications, although we present results in Table 9

demonstrating this is not the case.

III.C. Regression Analysis of Plan Transitions

       An alternative way to consider changes in plan choices is to model the transition between

the Standard Plan and Basic Plan, and vice versa, at open enrollment periods. In September

2011 the CWI was repealed and a premium was added to the Standard Plan. Although we do not

see a large change in the fraction of individuals enrolled in the Basic Plan, this could be masking

a large shift between the Standard and Basic Plans that roughly canceled out. To explore this

more formally, we estimate the following equation for non-Medicare retirees and Medicare

retirees separately.

       (2)



       In Table 8, the first three columns present estimates for each of the main plan changes:

(1) CWI-I on July 1, 2010; (2) CWI-II on July 1, 2011; and (3) repeal CWI plus introduce a

premium on the Standard Plan on September 1, 2011. For these equations, we restrict the

sample to those that were in the Standard Plan in the prior month, so the dependent variable is

the “transition” from the Standard Plan to the Basic Plan. The final column of Table 8 presents

the reverse equation:

       (3)



In equation 3, the sample is now those in the Basic Plan in the prior month and the dependent

variable is the transition from the Basic Plan to the Standard Plan. These individuals may be

those whose behavior was affected by the CWI but who are not sensitive to the introduction of

the premium on the Standard Plan. Panel A of Table 8 presents results for the sample of non-

Medicare retirees, while Panel B includes only Medicare retirees. The omitted age groups are

                                                19
ages 50-59 in Panel A and ages 66-69 in Panel B. The sample excludes subscribers who changed

Medicare eligibility status (non-Medicare retirees versus Medicare) in the two-month period.

                                             [Table 8]

       Some interesting patterns emerge when considering these month-to-month transitions

during the open enrollment periods, presented in Table 8. First, considering the two CWI

periods, we observe a large shift from the Standard Plan to the Basic Plan. This may be due to

the need to “attest” to not being a tobacco user and not being overweight. However, it may also

result from the default being changed to the Basic Plan. We observe that the effect of

dependents is opposite under CWI-I and CWI-II. One explanation of this could be that retired

public employees in North Carolina are more likely to have dependents that smoke (the point of

emphasis in CWI-I) than to have dependents that are obese (the target of CWI-II). Also, the

repeal of CWI was announced prior to CWI-II being implemented, so that individuals may have

chosen their plan based on the repeal. If subscribers with dependents are less sensitive to the

premium, because they are subject to a premium even under the Standard Plan (albeit a smaller

premium), that would be consistent with the negative estimated coefficient on covering

dependents in columns (2) and (3). In Table 8, Columns (3) and (4) we consider the transition

from Standard to Basic and the transition from Basic to Standard, respectively. Interestingly,

men are more likely to switch under the CWI than women. Men are slightly more likely to

transition to the Basic Plan and significantly less likely to transition from Basic to Standard.

Older non-Medicare retirees are less likely than younger non-Medicare retirees to transition

from Standard to Basic, perhaps because of greater medical care needs.

       Table 8, Panel B, repeats the same exercise for Medicare retirees. Recall that Medicare

retirees were not affected by the CWI and were never defaulted to the Basic Plan. We see that

less than a half of a percent of Medicare retirees transition to the Basic Plan from the Standard

Plan during either CWI period, and those that do transfer tend to be the youngest. Because

nearly all workers were in the Standard Plan prior to the introduction of the premium, only

                                                 20
about 2% of the population could be used to estimate Column 4 in Table 8 (Part B), so that has

been omitted. Prior literature suggests that as individuals age, price sensitivity declines and

plan changes are less likely overall (e.g., Buchmueller, 2002; Royalty and Solomon, 1999;

Strombom, Buchmueller, and Feldstein, 2002), which is consistent with the estimates in Table

8.

III.D. Robustness Check of Retirement Behavior and Dependent Coverage

       One might be concerned that the choice to retire and/or the choice to cover dependents

is affected by the plan parameters. Prior work has shown a link between access to retiree health

insurance and the age of retirement (see Fitzpatrick 2013; Leisersen 2013; Robinson and Clark

2010; Shoven and Slavov 2013). However, to our knowledge, no link has been found between

the generosity of the health insurance and the probability of retiring. To confirm that this is not

influencing our findings, we consider whether plan modifications changed the probability of

retiring. Similarly, if dependent coverage becomes more expensive relative to outside options

we might find subscribers dropping dependents, whose coverage is not explicitly subsidized.

       Table 9 explores both of these possibilities empirically. First, taking a sample of all

subscribers (whether active or retired) ages 50-69, we regress a dummy variable for being

retired on the plan period dummies, subscriber, month and year fixed effects, and the age

categories (age 50-59 is the omitted category). Even with over 8 million observations, the time

period dummy variables do not significantly predict retirement status, once year and month

fixed effects are included in the model (except for the pooled sample under CWI-I).

Reassuringly, we do observe that there is a strong age gradient with the probability of

retirement. The estimated coefficients are very similar when comparing individuals that cover

dependents versus those that do not.

                                                 [Table 9]

       Columns (4) and (5) of Table 9 consider whether the choice to cover dependents is

influenced by the plan changes. We might expect that as the generosity of the plan declines,

                                                21
individuals will chose to purchase health insurance in the private market, switch to spouse’s

insurance, or choose to go without insurance. However, during this time period, health

insurance costs are everywhere rising. The regressions again include subscriber, month, and

year fixed effects. Although the coefficients are statistically significant, the magnitudes are small

and do not indicate a strong pattern of a decline or increase of dependent coverage due to plan

modifications. These results suggest that the CWI, repeal, and premium did not substantially

influence the composition of the sample.

IV. Plan Costs and Unfunded Liabilities

       Because the Basic Plan had a higher co-insurance rate and less generous plan

parameters, the large shift of non-Medicare retirees to the Basic Plan should have led to a

notable decline in both experienced and projected costs of providing retiree health insurance

(RHI). Here we explore whether the rate of annual increase in the total cost of SHP for retirees

was affected by these policy changes. While we can directly compare the level differences, it is

more difficult to assess what the growth in expenses would have been absent these changes.

       When enrollees are shifted from a more generous to less generous plan, one concern is

that insurance unraveling could occur whereby the cost of providing the more generous plan

increases as the least costly individuals exit to the less generous plan (see Cutler and Reber 1998

for an example of insurance unraveling). In our setting, because subscribers must pay the full

cost for dependents and because the CWI was designed to bring less healthy, not the most

healthy individuals into the Basic Plan, the extent of adverse selection is predicted to be

relatively minor. Reductions in plan generosity are also predicted to decrease the consumption

of medical care (reducing “moral hazard” of overconsumption of medical services), as

individuals must pay more out-of-pocket for any medical treatments. The benefit of reduced

consumption could be outweighed by the cost of individuals forgoing preventative care and

ultimately experiencing greater medical costs.




                                                 22
IV.A. Fiscal Year Plan Costs

           Table 10 explores several measures of cost and approximations for medical care

utilization. The enrollment figures in Panel A of Table 10 are consistent with the SHP data and

indicate a large shift into Basic Plan enrollment for non-Medicare retirees. We also observe that

the population of Medicare retirees is growing faster than that of non-Medicare retirees. Thus,

the cost figures are presented normalized by enrollment, so that the cost per member can be

directly compared.26

                                                       [Table 10]

           The second set of rows, Panel B of Table 10, present the payments made by the SHP,

which are allowed charges minus employee out-of-pocket payments and coordination of benefits

(mostly Medicare payments). These figures are broken out by Standard and Basic Plan for non-

Medicare and Medicare retirees. We see that between fiscal year 2010 (July 2009 – June 2010)

and fiscal year 2011 (July 2010 – June 2011) there was a marked increase in costs among the

non-Medicare retirees in both plans. This should be expected if the least expensive members of

the Standard Plan shifted to the Basic Plan, causing the per-enrollee costs to rise in each plan

(see Cutler and Reber, 1998 for a description of insurance unraveling). However, when

considering the average cost of providing RHI to non-Medicare retirees, we see a much more

modest rise of about 5 percent. Using the National Health Expenditure Data, Hartman, et al.

(2013) report that nationally, health consumption expenditures rose by exactly 3.9 percent in

2009, 2010, and 2011 (i.e., costs rose 11.7 percent between the beginning of 2009 and the end of



26   Note that the SHP data include only the explicit cost of retiree health insurance. By including retirees
and their dependents in the risk pool, the cost of active worker health insurance rises (see Clark and
Morrill, 2010). However, since the plan is self-insured, the “implicit” subsidy of pooling is not relevant for
total costs of SHP which includes both active and retired employees. GASB standards require that the
implicit subsidy be consider as a cost of RHI and must be reflected in the calculation of the accrued
liabilities of the retiree health plan. However, on an annual cost basis, the lower cost of premiums for
retirees is offset by a higher cost for active employees.


                                                       23
2011). Thus, relative to a national average for all health expenditures, the cost growth for non-

Medicare retirees was moderate.

       Next, if we consider the Medicare retirees as a control group in this first time period, we

notice a much smaller growth in the cost to the plan among that group, approximately 1 percent.

It appears that the cost growth for non-Medicare retirees was actually larger than for the

Medicare retirees. However, this does not necessarily imply that the CWI increased costs

relative to what they would have been. The SHP costs for Medicare retirees are a function of

Medicare allowed charges for services, whereas the allowed charges for non-Medicare retirees

are determined by the SHP directly. As discussed in detail below, it seems that over this time

period, Medicare reimbursement rates changed in ways that are difficult to explain and are not

due to SHP plan modifications.

       Considering the difference between FY2011 and FY2012 (i.e., July 2010-June 2011 versus

July 2011-June 2012), we observe the blended effects of the implementation of CWI-II, the

repeal of CWI-I and CWI-II, the premium, and the approximately 16 percent increase in

copayments, coinsurance maximums, and deductibles. Here we see that the SHP plan costs

dropped slightly for non-Medicare retirees and by 8 percent for Medicare retirees. This large

decline in SHP plan payments for Medicare retirees is surprising, and we explore this in more

detail below.

       Panel C of Table 10 considers the total allowed charges, which should not be sensitive to

the cost shifting to members through premiums, copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that

happened in September 2011. Here we see a slightly higher 5 percent rise in charges between

FY2010 and FY2011 for non-Medicare retirees relative to a 4 percent rise for Medicare retirees.

This again suggests that the CWI-I did not moderate cost growth for non-Medicare retirees, if

Medicare retirees are an appropriate control group. Interestingly, the total allowed charges

were basically flat for non-Medicare retirees between FY2011 and FY2012, but fell by 6.5 percent

among Medicare retirees. So we are again finding that the second phase of CWI is associated

                                                24
with a sharp drop in charges for Medicare retirees. Before exploring this further, we consider

first whether the FY2010 to FY2011 cost growth is consistent with national data.

          At this time, the growth in Medicare spending per enrollee was 4.3%, 1.8%, and 3.6% in

2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively (Hartman et al, 2013), or approximately 10% between 2009

and 2011. Thus, compared with national trends, the CWI did not appear to reduce costs for RHI

and may have even lead to larger increases than would have been experienced in the absence of

plan modifications. This is similar to the findings of insurance market unraveling in Cutler and

Reber (1998), where when individuals on the margin are shifted into a less generous plan, the

costs actually rise in both plans due to adverse selection. However, without a true control group,

it is difficult to assess how the plan modifications changed costs.

          To explore this further, Figure 4 plots historical data from 1991 through 2011, where

available, for Medicare expenditures and Medicare costs per enrollee (in North Carolina and in

the United States on average). We then include historical cost information on the SHP per

enrollee expenditure through 2012. These data are slightly different than that presented in

Table 10, in order to develop a historical trend line. 27 The year here is the fiscal year ending in

June (so 2009 corresponds to July 2008-June 2009). The data for 2007 and 2008 were not

available as the SHP did not make a report to the legislature in those years. The estimates are

for per enrollee expenditures on medical claims, net of Medicare reimbursements and out-of-

pocket amounts and gross of refunds.

                                                     [Figure 4]

          Figure 4 illustrates a steady rise in medical spending over the past two decades. The cost

growth in the SHP is approximately equal to the growth in Medicare spending, with the

exception of the most recent years. We see here that the rise between 2009 and 2011 and the


27   These figures include paid medical claims for retirees only (no dependents). From 1991-2006 the data
include paid pharmacy claims for retirees only, while the 2009-2012 figures include pharmacy claims for
dependents as well.


                                                     25
decline in 2012 was very slight compared with earlier trends. In this figure it appears that

during the time period under investigation in this study, the SHP costs grew at a lower rate than

what would have been expected from either the historical trend or the cost growth in Medicare.

As shown below, we believe this is attributable to the increases in out-of-pocket costs and the

introduction of the premium, not the CWI.

          Although Figure 4 indicated no drop in Medicare expenditure nationally through 2011,

data for 2012 is not yet available. Returning to Table 10, we consider potential explanations for

the drop in Medicare retiree costs for the SHP in FY2012. We first consider whether utilization

dropped. Panel D presents the average number of visits per member. These are visits that are

subject to a copay, so do not include many outpatient procedures. We see that office visits

dropped for both groups of retirees, but the largest decline was a 4 percent decrease for non-

Medicare retirees between FY2011 and FY2012. Thus, it does not appear that there was a drop

in utilization among Medicare retirees that would explain the large cost savings.

          Finally, Panel E of Table 10 considers the total allowed charges per visit. Here we see

that for Medicare retirees, the allowed charges per visit fall substantially between FY2011 and

FY2012. There are several potential explanations for this. First, reimbursement rates to

Medicare could have dropped, resulting in lower costs for the SHP as well. There were some

adjustments over this time period for some Medicare inpatient rates, which declined in order to

recoup overcharges by hospitals in previous periods.28 In addition, or alternatively, there could

be some technological progress that disproportionately affected Medicare retirees such that the

cost of procedures declined. Similarly, patients could have chosen to be seen in more cost

efficient facilities or the mix of treatments needed could have changed to lower cost procedures.

As of October 8, 2013, the SHP has convened a group of subject matter experts to determine

                                                     26
why Medicare payments dropped by such a large percent during this time period. For our

purposes, it seems clear that the shift to the Basic Plan cannot explain the reduction in costs.

We therefore conclude that the plan modifications over this time period did not substantially

alter costs, with the caveat that there is some unexplained drop in costs for Medicare retirees

between FY2011 and FY2012.

          On the whole, the large shifts in plan choice among non-Medicare retirees associated

with CWI-I, and the more moderate shifts due to the repeal of CWI and the introduction of the

premium, did not lead to a clear and unambiguous decline in the cost of providing RHI. We

next consider how the actuarially accrued liabilities associated with RHI were affected by the

plan modifications.

IV.B. RHI Unfunded Liabilities

          Until recently, the liabilities associated with extending subsidized access to the SHP to

retirees were not well understood or clearly quantified.29 In 2004, the Governmental

Accounting Standards Board issued statements that required public employers to prepare

actuarial statements that reported the actuarial accrued liabilities (AAL) of retiree health plans.

The first such statement in North Carolina was prepared by Aon Consulting in December of

2006 covering the plan as of December 31, 2005. The actuarial statement indicated the AAL

was $23.9 billion and that the state had assets of only $139 million in reserve. Thus, the state

had unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities (UAAL) of $23.8 billion in 2005. Subsequent reports

covering the years 2007-2011 show a rise in the UAAL to $29.6 billion in 2011, an increase in 6

years of $5.8 billion (24 percent).

                                                     [Table 11]



29   Clark and Morrill (2010) discuss the GASB requirements and present evidence from these actuarial
reports for all 50 states. Similar analysis can be found in Pew Center on the States (2010). Clark (2010)
presents similar data focusing on retiree health plans for public school teachers. Additional discussion of
retiree health plans and their financial status is provided in Clark (2009).


                                                     27
          The actuarial statements are based on current law, projections of future employment and

the number of retirees, and the health care cost trend rate. Unlike pensions, which have a

legislated formula that determines generosity, the actual health plan offered to retirees can be

modified within certain limitations established by case law. Table 11 shows the projected

liability in each valuation to date, as well as the primary reasons for any change in the projected

liability.30 Notice that the projected liabilities are most affected by out-of-pocket increases and

actuarial assumptions, and that the CWI did not seem to impact the UAAL at all.

          Although the state maintains a small trust fund for retiree health, the annual cost of

premiums for retired workers is paid primarily by annual appropriations. The annual cost of

providing coverage to retirees has increased rapidly over the past three decades. In 1984,

premiums for retirees were $23.3 million. By 1990, state expenditures had increased to $70.8

million, and by 2000 the employer cost of premiums for retirees reached $192.0 million.

Annual costs have more than tripled in the last decade and in 2010 totaled $616.0 million.

Using inflation adjusted dollars (1982-84 = 100), the annual state expenditures rose from $22.4

million in 1984 to $282.2 million in 2010. The rate of increase in the annual cost of retiree

health insurance has outpaced the growth of the state budget. As a result, the proportion of the

state budget devoted to retiree health insurance has increased from 0.65 percent in 1995 to 1.33

percent in 2010, roughly a 105 percent increase in the proportion of the state budget allocated to

retiree health insurance over those 15 years. The UAAL as a percent of payroll has risen from

192.4 percent in 2005 to 216.5 percent in 2009. The actuarial statements report the annual

required contribution (ARC), which is the normal cost of the plan plus contributions needed to

amortize the UAAL over 30 years. The ARC has increased from $2.4 billion in 2005 to $3.0

billion in 2009. This represents an increase in the ARC as a percentage of state payroll from

19.3 to 19.9 percent. From 2005-2009, the state paid slightly more than the annual cost for

current retirees but had not attempted to reduce the UAAL by making the annual required

contribution necessary to move toward full funding of the plan, which is one cause of the

increase in the UAAL.31

IV.C. The Affordable Care Act

           Like all employer-provided health insurance plans, the SHP has already been affected by

the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and will be affected in the coming years. Short-term impacts of

these changes in North Carolina are estimated have only minor cost implications. The

expansion of dependent coverage up to age 26 is estimated to increase annual expenditures by

the SHP by $15 to $20 million.32 Changes in the use of pre-existing condition clauses and the

elimination of lifetime caps on individual claims are expected to have only negligible effects on

annual expenditures. It should be noted that these changes are unlikely to affect North

Carolina’s SHP because it already did not subsidize dependent coverage and did not have

lifetime caps.

           The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program provision of the Affordable Care Act provides

subsidies to employers who offer retiree health insurance to former employees between the ages

of 55 and 65. This program has already used all appropriated funds but provided approximately

$70 million of revenue to the SHP. The state will also need to make a decision on whether it

wishes to retain “grandfather status” of the SHP. Retaining this designation exempts the SHP

from some aspects of the Affordable Care Act but limits possible changes to the plan.33 Longer-

term cost implications will be determined by the insurance exchanges that are established and

31   Clark (2009) compares the liabilities across states for general state employees while Clark (2010)
examines retiree health liabilities associated with providing this benefit to public school teachers.

whether state employees or retirees migrate from the SHP to one of the exchanges. In addition,

costs will be influenced by whether federal law ultimately requires the state to provide a

specified level of health benefits that exceed the current levels offered by the SHP.

V. Discussion and Conclusions

           The cost of providing health insurance for retired public workers continues to increase

rapidly and has been in excess of the inflation rate, the rate of growth of payroll, and the rate of

growth of state revenues in North Carolina. This fiscal pressure on state finances has occurred

despite changes in the SHP that have reduced annual costs. Unfunded liabilities associated with

health insurance for retirees are also rising because North Carolina, like many states, has

financed its plan using pay-as-you-go funding. Therefore accrued liabilities continue to grow

without any corresponding increase in funds to pay for these promised benefits.34

           One method employers have adopted to moderate the increase in the cost health

insurance is to provide incentives or penalties in an effort to move employees and retirees into

plans that have lower employer costs. This study examines the impact of policy changes in the

North Carolina State Health Plan on the plan choices of retirees. The state introduced two

wellness initiatives that required smokers and then overweight retirees who were not yet eligible

for Medicare to move to a less generous plan which had lower employer costs. The adoption of

these CWIs resulted in about one third of all such retirees moving immediately from the

Standard to the Basic plan. At the same time, Medicare eligible retirees, who were not covered

by the CWIs, had only a small increase in enrollment in the Basic plan. Thus, it seems

reasonable to conclude that the policy initiatives successful achieved their primary objective of

moving less healthy, higher cost retirees into the less generous plan.




34   It should be noted that in North Carolina collective bargaining by public employees is not allowed by
law, so there are no powerful union interests that might hinder the state from adjusting employee
benefits.


                                                       30
       Shortly after the introduction of the second CWI, North Carolina repealed both of the

CWIs and instituted a premium on the Standard plan. After the implementation of these two

policies, the total enrollment in the Basic plan remained relatively constant; however, we

observed considerable movement from the Standard to the Basic plan as some retirees shifted

plans to avoid the new premium and from the Basic to the Standard plan as many of those who

were required to move to the Basic plan shifted back to the Standard plan. The evidence seems

to clearly suggest that retirees are sensitive to policy changes such as wellness requirements and

premiums. In January 2014 the SHP is introducing a series of plan changes, including the

introduction of a consumer-driven health plan. The results of this study suggest that retirees do

shift between plans, although it is unclear whether retirees will be willing to adopt a plan that is

vastly different from the PPO’s that have been offered in the recent past.

       Despite this substantial behavioral response to the plan modifications, the implications

for costs were relatively modest. Under CWI-I costs rose for both the non-Medicare retirees and

the Medicare retirees, although the evidence suggests that this growth may have been less than

what would have been expected given historical trends and trends in Medicare spending. When

considering the unfunded actuarially accrued liabilities (UAAL) associated RHI in North

Carolina, we see that the most significant factors were assumptions about trends and increases

in retiree-paid premiums. The CWI had very little impact on the UAAL calculations.

The State Health Plan historical claims data are from records kept by the Legislative staff based
on reports from the SHP to the legislature. These figures include paid medical claims for
retirees only (no dependents). From 1991-2006 the data include paid pharmacy claims for
retirees only, while the 2009-2012 figures include pharmacy claims for dependents as well. The
estimates are for per enrollee expenditures on medical claims, net of Medicare reimbursements
and out-of-pocket amounts and gross of refunds.

Notes: The dependent variable is an indicator for whether the retiree chose the Basic Plan in the
first month of being newly retired or being newly eligible for Medicare. The specifications
include month and year fixed effects, not reported. Coefficients are estimated by a linear
probability model with standard errors in parentheses. In Column (1) the sample is all non-
Medicare retirees in the first month observed as a non-Medicare retiree (omitting July 2009),
while Column (2) includes retirees that first appear as a retiree eligible for Medicare (omitting
July 2009). In Columns (3) the sample is restricted to individuals ages 64-65 in the first month
after a transition from non-Medicare eligible to Medicare-eligible.

Notes: The unit of observation is a subscriber-month. In Columns (1) - (3) the dependent variable is whether the individual is
currently retired among all subscribers (active or retired) who were age 50-69 on January 1. In Columns (4) – (5), the dependent
variable is whether the retiree chose to cover dependents in that month among all subscribers who are receiving benefits as a
Medicare-eligible or non-Medicare eligible and who are at least age 50. Coefficients are estimated with a linear probability model;
standard errors are in parentheses. The sample is an unbalanced panel of status in each month between July 2009 and December
2012. Each specification includes subscriber, month, and year fixed effects.
