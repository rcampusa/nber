We present estimates of 4 and 8 firm concentration ratios by industry and in weighted aggregate form
for the manufacturing sector for Chinese enterprises for 2002 and 2007. These are then compared to
available estimates for the same years and industrial classification for the US. These comparisons clearly
point in the direction of China having sharply lower concentration ratios, in the order of one half of
the US for 4 firm ratios. One possible implication is that markets for Chinese manufactured products
are considerably more competitive than in the US.

1. Introduction

In this paper we present estimates of 4 and 8 firm concentration ratios by industry and in
weighted aggregate form for the manufacturing sector for Chinese enterprises for 2002 and 2007.
These are then compared to available estimates for the same years and industrial classification
for the US. These comparisons clearly point in the direction of China having sharply lower
concentration ratios, in the order of one half of the US for 4 firm ratios. One possible implication
is that markets for Chinese manufactured products are considerably more competitive than in the
US.

For our central comparisons we use data from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
and the US Census Bureau (CB). Our calculations for China are made for the same individual
industrial categories and years used in the US CB data, and so we can draw country comparisons
between concentration ratios organized on the same industrial classification. These groupings
differ a little from these used in other US studies (Pryor, 2001; 2002), but also allow weighted
average concentration ratios for both countries to be calculated using value-added by industry as
weights.

For 4-firm concentration ratios, the weighted average ratio for Chinese manufacturing enterprises
in 2002 is in the range of 0.2, and around 0.15 in 2007, approximately half of what is reported in
CB data for the US. China-US ratio comparisons are a little larger than one half for 8-firm
concentration ratios. The ratio estimates reported here also suggest that in China industrial
concentration is declining significantly over the period 2002 to 2007, while estimates for the US
point in the direction of slightly increasing ratios over time. This all points in the direction of
relative competitiveness in manufactures between the US and China diverging rather than
converging. We also report on supplementary calculations of concentration ratios from other
sources, which while not so directly comparable, also clearly point in the same general directions.

Several qualifications are in order in interpreting these calculations. First, the data we use only
relate to the manufacturing sector in China and the US and thus exclude critical service sectors
such as banking, telecoms and transportation where there is extensive presence of large state-
owned monopoly enterprises in China. The relative concentration estimates for the whole
economy could be much closer were non-manufacturing sectors able to be included. In addition,

                                                 3
it is not possible from available data to separate out individual categories of enterprises, which
could also affect the calculations. For instance, foreign enterprises producing exclusively for
export are included in these estimates for China, and thus concentration ratios include both
foreign and domestic economic activity. Finally, the Chinese economy is widely thought to be
considerably more regionally fragmented than the more regionally integrated US economy. Thus,
in any individual regional economy there could be less competition in the Chinese economy than
in the US economy, even though the aggregate economy wide concentration ratios suggest the
opposite.

2. Data and Methods of Calculation

2.1 Chinese Data

We use Chinese data from 3 separate sources to calculate individual concentration ratios for
manufacturing industries, which we then aggregate using industry value-added weights. Since
we use US concentration ratio estimates from United States Census Bureau data for comparative
purposes, we restrict Chinese data to the same years as available in US data, and also place
Chinese data onto the same industrial classification as US CB data.

To do this we use concordances between the North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS), the National Industry Classification for China (GB)1 and the International Standard
Industry Classification (ISIC). We report Chinese industrial concentration ratios for the same
ISIC classification as in the US CB data.

Data Sources

The first Chinese source is China Industrial Enterprises data from the National Bureau of
Statistics of China for 2002 and 2007. It covers all state-owned enterprises, and those non-state-
owned enterprises with annual sales of ﬁve million RMB (Chinese currency) or more. The data
contain ﬁrm identiﬁcation information, and their operation and performance information,
including both sales and value-added.

Data Arrangement

1
 The National Industry Classification for China is issued by the National Bureau of Statistics, which is abbreviated as
GB/T4754-2002. Here we use GB to represent this abbreviation.

                                                                4
To improve the accuracy of the data, we have deleted some observations based on the following
criteria: (1) We delete observations where key indicators are missing (number of employees,
total assets or net fixed assets, etc.) ; (2) Following Jefferson et al. (2008), we delete observations
where the numbers of employees are less than 8 because they are likely individually owned
stores without a reliable accounting system; (3) Following Bai et al. (2009), we also delete
observations with a ratio of profit either below a 0.1% level or above a 99.9% level; (4) If total
assets are less than current assets and the net value of fixed assets we drop the observations. And
if accumulated depreciation is less than the current depreciation, we also drop the observations;
(5) We delete observations that for which paid-up capital is less than or equal to 0 and delete
observations with sales below 500 million RMB.

The Calculation of Concentration ratios

Using the modified Chinese data, we calculate the concentration ratios of 3-digit GB industries
and then transfer these concentration ratios to corresponding ISIC categories. We use the
following three-step procedure to calculate weighted average aggregate concentration ratios for
the whole manufacturing sector:

   (1) Calculate the concentration ratios of 3-digit GB industries

       We first calculate each enterprise’s share of total manufacturing industry value-added in
       each industry in each year,      , ie

                                                                               (1)

       where         is the value-added of enterprise i in year t and   is industry j’s value-added in
       year t. m and r are separately the number of enterprises in industry j and the number of
       industries.

       We can then calculate n-firm concentration ratios for industry j as

                                                                               (2)

       In our later tables we concentrate on 4 and 8 firm concentration ratios.

   (2) Transfer the concentration ratios of 3-digit GB categories to corresponding ISIC
       categories
                                                   5
            The Chinese NBS publish a ‘National Industry Classification Comment’ which contains a
            correspondence table between GB (2002) and ISIC (Rev.3). The correspondence of the
            codes between GB and ISIC is not one to one, rather one GB code corresponds to several
            ISIC codes and one ISIC code corresponds to several GB codes. In order to make them
            match, we assume that the number of ISIC codes corresponding GB code j is               . We
            denote the value-added of industry j with GB code j as          and the n-firm concentration
            ratios as        . If we split industry j into -unit same size sub-industries, then the value-
            added and concentration ratio of each sub-industry separately are          and      .

            With these adjustments, each ISIC industry corresponds to a group including several sub-
            industries on a GB classification. Meanwhile, one sub-industry for GB corresponds to
            one industry for ISIC. We can then calculate the weighted average concentration ratio
            using the value-added of each sub-industry for each group as the corresponding
            concentration ratio using 3-digit ISIC codes.

       (3) Calculate the weighted average concentration ratios across 2-digit ISIC codes for the
            whole manufacturing industry for 4 and 8 firm concentration ratios using value-added as
            weights.

            Using a weighted average method, we calculate the concentration ratios for 2-digit ISIC
            codes and then for the whole of the manufacturing industry. For each year we weight
            industries by their value-added for the corresponding year. These results are reported in
            Table 1 along with comparable US estimates.

2.2 US Data

For the US we use manufacturing industry concentration ratios from the Economic Census
conducted by the US Census Bureau from which they calculate weighted concentration ratios1.
We adjust their data to correspond to the same ISIC codes as the Chinese data. The original data
are published as concentration ratios for 3-digit to 6-digit NAICS code for 2002 and 2007. We
use concentration ratios for 5-digit NAICS codes to calculate US concentration ratios
comparable to those for China. The United Nations Statistics Division issues a correspondence

We use value-added as weights. The numbers before 15 in the industrial classification are for ISIC codes for non-manufacturing industries.

table between ISIC (Rev.3) and NAICS (2002)1. We first use this correspondence to transfer
concentration ratios for 5-digit NAICS categories to corresponding ISIC categories.

Using this correspondence, we find that each 3-digit ISIC code corresponds to a group including
several 5-digit NAICS codes. We calculate the weighted average concentration ratio for each
group as the corresponding concentration ratio using 3-digit ISIC codes. Following the
calculation of Chinese ratios, we also calculate the concentration ratios for 2-digit ISIC codes
and the whole manufacturing industry for the US as a weighted average where industry value-
added are weights. These results are also reported in Table 1 to compare with Chinese results.

3. The Central US-Chinese Industrial Concentration Comparisons

Table 1 reports our central estimates of market concentration ratios for the Chinese and US
manufacturing sectors for 2002 and 2007 for both 4 and 8 firm ISIC categories. These estimates
show considerably lower concentration ratios in China for both years, and also for both 4 and 8
firm calculations. Ratios of comparable US to China concentration ratios increase from 1.75 to
2.37 between 2002 and 2007 for 4-firm ISIC categories aggregated by value-added. For 8-firm
ISIC categories, aggregated ratios increases in relative terms from 1.56 to 2.17 between 2002 and
2007. For the large majority of industries the concentration ratios for China substantially exceed
those for the US, with the maximum divergence being for the 4-firm ISIC comparison for 2002
for office, accounting, and computing machinery. From these estimates, an inference would seem
to be that Chinese markets for manufacturing goods are significantly more competitive than US
markets, and the difference in domestic competitive concentration is increasing rather than
decreasing.

4. Supportive Supplementary Calculations and Estimates

We also report some supplementary Chinese calculations of concentration ratios and, for the US,
secondary estimates of concentration ratios that together provide the same general picture that
we suggest for our main China-US comparison above. These are not on a strictly comparable
industrial classification basis and the years differ slightly from one another. We use Chinese data
from 2 separate sources to calculate individual industrial concentration ratios for sales for 24

Chinese industries, which we then aggregate using industry sales as weights. We make no
original calculation of US concentration ratios for comparative purposes, but instead rely on
secondary sources (Pryor, 2001) for supplementary US concentration ratio estimates.

The main Chinese source for these supplementary calculations is data compiled by an industrial
trade association in China, China Enterprise Confederation/China Enterprise Directors
Association. This is a non-state organization to which enterprises in China are members. Every
year it conducts a survey among its membership. In the survey it asks for data on a range of
items, including name of enterprise, sales income, profit and assets. It then tabulates this
information which is then published in an annual publication for the top 500 Chinese companies.
It unfortunately does this with gaps so that only an incomplete picture of industrial activity can
be obtained in certain years. We have been able to purchase missing data for individual years
over the period 2000-2010, but the only item for which a complete series for all years is available
for all 500 top firms is “sales income”. “Sales income” equates with revenue from sales by the
enterprise during the year and differs from the value-added used in our central comparison.

The industrial classification on which this data is available is for the 24 manufacturing industries
listed in Table 2, which is also available on the same classification of individual industries for
total sales reported in the Chinese Statistical Yearbook, our second supplementary data source.
We allocate sales income data for individual enterprise to the 24 manufacturing industry
category using judgment, given that some of the enterprises are multi-product enterprises.

Having identified sales income by enterprise for the top 500 Chinese firms, we then use data by
industry from the China Statistical Yearbook on total sales for the whole industry on the same 24
industry classification1.

Having allocated enterprise shares of sales to the 24 manufacturing industry groups using a best
judgment procedure where multi-product enterprises are involved, we then calculate
concentration ratios for each industry for the same 4 and 8 firm cases as above.

We use industrial sales as weights to calculate the total manufacturing. The numbers before 13 in the industrial classification are
for GB codes for non-manufacturing industries.




Where substantial concentration ratios occur (such as in petroleum processing in 2004) and there
is not a minimum of either the 4 or 8 enterprises required for the concentration ratios in the
corresponding industrial classification, then the industry values are not defined. This explains the
blanks in Table 2 (such as                   under foods, 2004).

By way of comparison, Table 3 reports Pryor’s (2002) estimates of US concentration ratios for
1992 and 1997 using value-added as weights to aggregate concentration ratios. These stand in
similar relation to the supplementary Chinese concentration ratios in Table 2 as in our main
estimates in Table 1. Estimates for China are approximately one half of those for the US and the
difference between the US and Chinese ratios increases over time.

5. Concluding Remarks

In China’s WTO accession terms, China agreed to being classified as a non-market economy,
thus affecting China’s situation with respect to anti-dumping duties in OECD export markets.
The basis for the non-market claim was the preponderance of state-owned enterprises in China’s
manufacturing sector at the time and the belief that they dominated Chinese domestic markets
which were viewed as highly concentrated. The calculations we report of relative concentration
ratios between China and US point in the opposite direction of China having a more competitive
manufacturing sector than the US and hence, if anything, China now having more claim that they
have evolved from that non-market economy status of a decade ago. Our calculations challenge
this still wildly held perception, but this claim is subject to the qualifications set out in the
introduction.
