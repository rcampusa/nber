     This paper contains an analysis of the role of international reserves
under a regime of pegged exchange rates and under a regime of managed floating.
It presents evidence on the stability of the demand for reserves during the
periods 1963—72 and 1973—75. It is shown that the demand for reserves by
developed countries differs from that of less—developed countries and that
the system underwent a structural change by the end of 1972. In view of the
drastic change in the international monetary system, the extent of the structural
change has not been as large as might have been expected, thus leading to
the observation that economic behavior seems to be more stable than legal
arrangements. From the policy perspective it follows that the problems
concerning the role of the International Monetary Fund in this context are as
relevant at the present as they were in the past..
     The paper concludes with a sketch of a stochastic framework for the
analysis of the optimal degree of managed floating. And its purpose is to
suggest an additional set of variables which might be incorporated into the
specification of the demand for international reserves. It is shown that the
optimal degree of exchange rate flexibility depends on the stochastic nature
of the shocks that the economy faces. The stochastic characteristics of the
shocks include a distinction between real and monetary shocks, domestic and
foreign shocks and depend on the covariances among the various shocks.

                               I. Introduction

          One of the striking features characterizing the international monetary

system since the early 1970's has been the continued use of international reserves

even though, legally, the system has been characterized as a flexible exchange

rate regime.

          In this paper I analyze the interrelationship between the determinants

and patterns of reserve holdings and the international monetary system. Section

II contains an empirical analysis of the demand for international reserves.

In this context I analyze the differences in behavioral patterns of developed and

less—developed countries. Section III deals with the empirical question of the

timing at which the system moved from pegged to floating rates. The interest

in this question stems from the belief that timing of changes in economic behavior

need not correspond to, or be associated with, the timing of changes In legal

commitments. One of the conclusions emerging from the analysis is that the

extent of the change in economic behavior (as far as the holdings of international

reserves is concerned) has not been as large as one might have predicted. Countries

have preferred to move to a system of managed floating that is intermediate

between the extremes of fixed rates and of clean float. Section IV provides a

sketch of an analytical framework for the analysis of a managed float regime.

Some concluding remarks and suggested extensions are contained in Section V.


11.1 The Determinants of the Demand
     for International Reserves

          Earlier studies of the demand for reserves considered the variability

of international receipts and payments as an important argument in the demand

function (e.g., Kenen and Yudin, 1965; dower and Lipsey, 1968; Archibald


                                      1
                                         2


and Richmond, 1971). In addition, it has been suggested that the demand

function also depends on the propensity to import (e.g., Heller, 1966; Kelly,

1970; Clark, l970a;Flanders, 1971; Frenkel, l974a, 1974b, 1978; Hipple, 1974;

lyoha,1976). These and other studies have recently been surveyed by Grubel

(1971), Williamson (1973), Claassen (1974) and Cohen (1975).
           The choice of a variability measure as an argument in the demand

function   stems directly from the role of international reserves in serving
as a buffer stock accomodating fluctuations in external transactions.
Consequently,   it has   generally been expected that the demand for reserves
is positively associated with the extent of these fluctuations.
           The rationale for the use of the propensity to import as an argu-

ment is more involved. It stems from an application of the Keynesian

priceless model of the foreign trade multiplier. According to that model,

an external disequilibrium that is induced by a decline in export earnings,

could be corrected by a decline in output proportional to the multiplier.

The cost of output adjustment could be saved if the monetary authorities

are able to run down their stock of international reserves thereby enabling

them to finance the external deficit. Since the foreign trade multiplier

(and thus the required output dampening in the absence of reserves) is

inversely related to the marginal propensity to import, the popular approach

argues that the cost of not having reserves, and hence the demand for reserves,

is inversely related to the marginal propensity to import (see references

op cit.).     In the absence of data on the marginal propensity to import,

earlier empirical studies have replaced it by the ratio of imports to income,

i.e., by the average propensity (typically referred to as the degree of

"openness" of the economy). The coefficient of the average propensity to

import frequently appeared with the "wrong" (positive) sign when used to

estimate the demand for reserves.
                                           3

              Using an adjustment mechanism which emphasizes the role of relative

   prices, price level and demand for money, it was previously shown (Frenkel,

   l974a) that under certain assumptions, the demand for reserves was expected

   to be associated positively with the average propensity to import. This

   association was shown to be consistent with data for the period 1963—1967

   for both Developed and Less—Developed Countries (Frenkel, l974b). A simplified

   derivation of the association between reserve holdings and the propensity

   to import is presented in Appendix A.       It is shown that the relationship

   between these two variables is, in general, not a clear cut, although, under

   some assumptions this relationship is expected to be positive.

              In what follows I present cross—sectional estimates of the demand

   for international reserves where, in addition to the above mentioned variables,

   I have also included a scaling variable as one of the determinants of the

   demand.1



   11.2 Cross—Sectional Estimates of the
        Demand for International Reserves

              The empirical analysis includes data from 22 Developed Countries

   and 32 Less—Developed Countries (LDC's) and covers the period 1963—75.

   Appendix B contains the list of countries and definitions of variables used


             additional variable which in principle should have been included
in the list of the determinants of reserve holdings is the opportunity cost
of holding reserves. In practice, a large fraction of international reserves
is held in the form of short term interest—bearing assets and thus, the
opportunity cost is the difference between the alternative yield and the rate
of return on reserves. Previous studies faced serious difficulties in estimat-
ing this cost. Clark (1970a) decided to exclude this variable from his estima-
tion. Heller (1966) assumed that the cost was the same for all countries (5
percent). Kenen and Yudin (1965) used income per capita as a proxy, and found
that it had the "wrong" sign and was not significant. Kelly (1970) used in
addition to per capita income, the value of foreign assets and liabilities as
proxies, but found that in all cases the latter appeared with the "wrong" sign
while in some cases the former had the "wrong" sign. Courchene and Youssef
(1967) used the long—term interest rate as a proxy, and found that in five out
of nine cases its coefficient was not significantly negative. All these
attempts taken together, provided the rationale for not including this variable
in the estimating equations.

 in   the analysis. The classification of countries as Developed and Less—

Developed is based on that of the IMF. The choice of countries and the

period of analysis was determined by the availability of continuous series of dat

As indicated above, the demand function was assumed to depend on three

variables: (i) a measure of variability of internatidna]. receipts and

payments denoted by a; the value of a for each year was estimated
                                                                     by computing
the standard deviation over the previous 15 years of the trend—adjusted annual
changes of the level of reserves;3 (ii) a scaling variable measuring the size
of international transactions represnted by the level of GNP, Y; in the few
cases where this was not available, it was replaced by Gross Domestic
                                                                            Products,
GDP, and (iii) the average propensity to import, m      IM/Y, where IM denotes

imports.

            The functional form of the demand function was assumed to be:

(1)

where u denotes an error term.
           Tables 1 and 2 present for each year the cross—sectional ordinary—least—
squares    estimates of the demand for reserves by developed and less—developed

countries. In all cases the coefficients have the expected positive sign and in

most cases these coefficients are statistically significant at the 95 percent

confidence   level.
          2From the list of countries for which data were available, two
countries——Canada and the United States——were excluded from the analysis.
Canada was excluded since it had a flexible exchange rate system during
most of the period for which the variability measure was calculated. Since
the discussion focuses on the behavior of countries as demanders of reserves,
the exclusion of the United States as the main supplier seems justified.
This relates to one of the limitations of the present approach of estimating
(tic tpn%4nJ (r       t-v.s
                         hy WMn$ of a single regression equation. To the
best of my knowledge, the potential difficulty of an identification problem
is shared by all previous empirical studies of the demand for reserves.
            limitation of this measure is that actual changes in reserves
need not provide an exact measure of the disturbance, since countries may
use other policies. Kenen and Yudin (1965) and Heller (1966) who have used
similar measures, have assumed that its estimates are not materially affected
by national policies.

            In   summary it should be noted that the overall I it of the regressions

 reported in Tables I. and 2 (as measured by the coefficients of determination

 R2) is very satisfactory. This point is noteworthy since these results

 pertain to cross—sectional estimates. Of special interest is the good fit

 of the cross—sectional regressions for the last few years reported in Tables

 1 and 2. During the latter years of the sample period, the international

monetary system moved towards a greaterflexibi1ity of exchange rates. This

 move was expected to result in different as well as in less stable estimates

 of the parameters of the demand for reserves. Since, as will be shown below,

 the cross—sectional estimates seem to have remained stable (at least during

 the periods 1963—72 and 1973—75), more efficient estimates may be obtained

by ppoling the time series with cross sections.

 11.3 Pooled Time—Series and Cross—Sections:
      Pegged Versus Floating Exchange Rates

                        In order to examine the effect of the move to a regime

of flexible exchange rates, I have divided the sample into two periods: the

pegged exchange rate period (1963—72) and the flexible exchange rate period

(1973—75). In Section III I provide a formal justification for this division.

            To the extent that the coefficients of the cross—sectional equations

remained stable within each of the periods 1963—72 and l97375, one may

obtain    more efficient estimates by pooling the time—series with the cross—
sections. Table 3 contains the ordinary—least—squares estimates of the pooled
regression for both periods. In all cases the coefficients are positive
and significant at the 95 percent confidence level.
         I turn now to a comparison of the regression coefficients between
Developed and Less—Developed countries during the two periods. The first

method    used for this comparison was the dummy variables method as outlined by
Cujarti    (1970). According to this method, each and every   coefficient was

allowed    to differ between developed and less—developed countries by including

dummy variables pertaining to data for developed countries. The estimated

coefficients of the dummy variables are reported in Table 4 where it is seen

that for the first period the coefficients of the constant term and the variability

measure    are significantly higher for developed countries while the coefficients
of   Income are lower. For the latter period, however, the two groups differ signif i—

cantly    only in their constant term. These estimates reveal a larger degree of
economies of scale in the demand for reserves (as measured by the income
elasticity) in Developed Countries than in LDC's. It is also apparent that
the demand for reserves by LDC's is less sensitive to the variability measure
than the demand by Developed countries. The differences in the iXiCOIqe elas-
ticities   may   reflect differences in the character of the financial systems. The
financial   system £n   Developed   countries is more sophisticated than its counter-
part in   LDC's and thus entailing larger possibilities for economies of scale
in reserve management. In     addition, Developed countries have a larger access

to world capital markets and    greater   facilities for swap agreements. The higher
sensitivity of Developed countries to the variability measure may      reflect   larger
reluctance to cope with unexpected shocks by imposing trade controls and

of the F—statistics exceed the critical values at conventional cionfidence levels.

restrictions.4 These differences have diminished significantly with the

move towards greater flexibility of exchange rates.

            The dummy variables method focuses on comparisons between individual

coefficients. The second method that was employed in the comparison between

Developed and Less—Developed countries was that of the Chow—test following

the procedure described by Fisher (1970). The results of this test are

also reported in Table 4 where the F—statistics correspond to the null—hypothesis

that the OLS regressions in Table 4 do not differ from each other. The null

hypothesis is rejected since the values of the F—statistics exceed the critical

values at the 95 percent confidence level. Thus, also the Chow—test leads to

the conclusion thqt Developed and Less—Developed countries reveal different

behavior    concerning the holdings of international reserves.        It is of interest
to   explore in     greater detail the pattern of the move to the floating rates regime,
as   are implied by the characteristics of reserve holdings.

                           III. When Did the System Move from
                                Pegged to Floating Rates?

            The analysis in the previous sections made a distinction between

the periods 1963—12 and 1973—75. The presumption was that the evolution

of the international monetary system from pegged exchange rates to floating

exchange rates might have resulted in a structural        change in the demand for
international       reserves. In the present section I examine formally the timing

and extent of the structural change following the method proposed by Quandt

(1958, 1960)


            4For further elaboration of these and other interpretations see
Frenkel (1974b).
                  5For   this and other methods of analyzing switching regressions see

           Consider a situation In which a structural change occurred at year t*

to the two regimes (before and after t*) can be characterized by two distinct

regression equations like (2) —              (3)

where u         and u        are the error terms that are assumed to be distributed as
         flit       2nt
N(O, o) and N(O, a), B• and 82 are the vectors of the regression coefficients

corresponding to the two regimes, and where ii                          1,... ,N   denote the countries

(for the Developed countries N                22 and for the LDC's N =              32).   The analysis of

the timing of the structural change amounts to searching for the value of t*.

Quandt's method of estimating t*              involves         the following: first, a maximization

of the likelihood function (4) conditional on t*:


(4)       L(yt*)            (f)NT/2_Nt*a2_N(T_t*) exp -                  _1 t=lr      nl n

                                                                                                    n
                                                                                                            —

                                                                          2a
                                                                               T      N
                                                                    —

                                                                        2   'L1 n1
                                                                                           (y1 —   x'B2)2}

(where N denotes the number of countries and T denotes the number of years), and

second, determination of the breakpoint t as the value which yields the highest

maximum likelihood L(yt*). The application of this procedure to determining

the breakpoint in the demand for reserves, yields 1973 and 1972 as the estimates

for t*    for   Developed and Less—Developed countries, respectively. -

                         Based on these results, 1972 is used as the estimate of

     the break point for both the Developed and the Less Developed Countriee,,.
     implying that the two subperiods are 1963—72 and 1973—75.
     This choice is based on the fact that while for LDC's 1972 seems to be an

     unambiguous estimate for the date of the structural change, the case for

     Developed Countries is less clear cut; it is therefore assumed that, by

     analogy with the LDC's, the break point for Developed Countries also

     occurred in 1972. The validity of this assumption can be tested by applying

     the likelihood—ratio test to the null hypothesis that no switch took place

     between 1972 and 1973. The likelihood ratio statistic is


                                      4)   = Nt*N(T_t*)/ANT

     where T is the estimated standard deviation of the residuals from the single

     regression estimated over the entire period 1963—75.

              According to the null hypothesis, —2 Ln         is distributed       The

     null hypothesis is rejected for both groups of countries. For the LDC's the

     value of —2 Lu 4)   is   16.4 while the corresponding value for Developed

     Countries is 21.2, both exceeding 15.1——the critical value at the 99 percent

     confidence level.6 The practical implication is that for the purpose of
     estimation, data from the
     period 1963—72 should not be pooled with those from the period 1973—75 and

     that the structural change occurred by the end of 1972.

              In addition to the above tests one may also use a Chow—test to

     test for the equality of the regression coefficients between the two periods.7

     The resulting values of the F—statistics relevant for testing the null hypothesis

         61t should be noted that the application of this method to the problem
at hand is not without conceptual difficulties since it requires differentiating
the likelihood function with respect to t*.
It should also be noted that the analysis assumes that the structural change
has taken place at a given point in time._ An alternative., approach would allow
for a gradual evolution, and would estimate regression equations with variable
coefficients. For references and discussion of the properties of the distribution
of —2 Ln $ see Goj,dfeld and Quandt (1976, Ch. 1).

         71n implementing the Chow—test one pretends that t* was known a priori.
Goldfeld and Quandt (1976, Ch. 1) provide reference to evidence that the
Chow—test yields satisfactory results.

are 4.97 for Developed Countries and 3.79 for LDC's——well above the critical

values at the 99 percent confidence level. Thus, the Chow—test as well leads

to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The overall inference is that the

system has changed by the end of 1972. It is this conclusion which provides

the   rationale for the pattern of the intertemporal pooling that is employed
in Tables 3_4•8    It should be noted that even though, as a statistical matter,
the   system underwent a structural change, the extent of the change has not been 1.

enough to make obsolete parameter estimates that are based on the period 1963—72.

In fact, forecasting reserve holdings during the period 1973—75 based on paramete

estimates from 1963—72, yield extremely good predictions (for details see

Frenkel, 1978).

           The interpretation of the relative stability of the patterns of reserve

holdings is quite obvious: during the pegged rate regime the rate was adjustabic

rather than fixed and during the so—called floating rate regime the rate has beer

managed rather than free. Economic behavior seems to be more stable than legal

arrangements. Central banks have revealed that their choice is for neither of

the extreme exchange rate systems, but have rather, preferred to have the inter-

mediate system àf managed floating. Since managing the float requires internati.J

reserves, it seems relevant to analyze the determinants of the degree to which

countries will attempt to manage the float. In the following section I deal

with some analytical aspects of managed floating.




         8The above discussion associated the structural change with the change
in the exchange rate regime; it could of cour8e reflect other (not necessarily
unrelated) phenomena which occurred in the early 1970's like the oil crisis
and the commodity price boom.

                   IV. A Sketch of a Framework for the Analysis
                                of Managed Float9

         In this section 1 provide a sketch of an analytical framework for

the analysis of the economics of managed floating. The analysis will highlight

some variables which should be included as determinants of the demand for

reserves under a regime of managed float.
     -

         Earlier   discussions oE the optimal exchange rate regime centered

around comparisons between fixed and flexible exchangà rate systems. More

recent explorations——originating with Mundell's contributions in the early

l960's——have shifted to the determination of optimal currency areas within

which exchange rates are fixed and between which exchange ares are flexible.

The following analysis of the optimal managed float recognizes that the

spectrum of possibilities is broader and that the rate of exchange between

any pair of currencies need not be entirely fixed or flexible but rather

it might be some optimal mix of the two extremes. In what follows I will

sketch a simple analytical framework that highlights some of the determinants

of the optimal degree of exchange rate flexibility. The analysis will emphasize

the role of the stochastic structure of the various shocks which affect the

economy, and its purpose is to suggest and additional set of variables which
might be incorporated into the specification of the demand for international

reserves under a regime of managed float.

         Consider a small economy that is subject to two types of repetitive

and serially uncorrelated shocks. These shocks, which are specified below

in a manner similar to that of Fischer (1977), are referred to as real and

monetary shocks.




            am indebted to Michael Bazdarich for research assistance and
suggestions concerning the material in this section. The material in this
section draws on Frenkel (19761,). -                    -

where p is a stochastic shock (the "real" shock) with a constant variance q2.
                                                                           Ii

as to assure that the expected value of output equals y (permanent income).

         The second shock arises from the monetary sector. Let the demand

for nominal cash balances L be

              t             tt eC;                         £


where k denotes the desired money—income ratio,. P denotes the domestic
price level and C     denotes        the stochastic shock to the demand for money

(the "monetary" shock).

         The domestic price level is linked to the foreign price through

the purchaiing power parity relationship. Thus


(7)         Pt =SP*    tt
where P denotes the foreign price level and St denotes the exchange rate
(the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency). To simplify

the analysis it is assumed that foreign prices are fixed, (and thus it

will be denoted henceforth as p*), that purchasing power parity holds

deterministically and that p and e are independent)°

            more elaborate analysis would allow for disturbances which
originate from the foreign sector and which are allowed to be correlated
with domestic shocks.                                          Another
extension would allow for possible short run deviations from purchasing
power parity in which case, in the short run changes in the exchange rate
induce changes in relative prices. For a rationale for managed float
that is based on this phenomenon see Mussa (1976); for recent empirical
evidence on the short run relationship between exchange rates and relative
prices see Dornbusch and Krugman (1977). In a recent analysis of the
optimal foreign exchange intervention Boyer (1976) extends and applies
Poole's framework (1970) to the problem at hand. Boyer assumes that
real income is fixed and that the objective function is to minimize varia-
bility of prices.

The coefficient y characterizes the whole spectrum of exchange rate regimes.

When y      0, the system is that of a fixed exchange rate, and when y   1

 the system is that of a freely flexible exchange rate. An intermediate

value of y indicates art intermediate degree of exchange rate flexibility.

We will refer to the coefficient x as the coefficient of managed float, or

the intervention index. From the policy perspective, the basic question is

to determine the optimal value of y, and thus to determine the optimal degree

of exchange rate flexibility.

            In principle, if shocks were identifiable, the optimal policy would

be to allow the exchange rate to correct monetary disturbances but not real

disturbances.11 We will assume, however, that information is incomplete and

that during a given period only the joint outcome of the shocks p +      is

known but not the separate values of p and c. It is this lack of complete

information which necessitates a second—best policy of managed float)-2

           Assume that the objective is to minimize the losses due to imperfect

information and that the policymaker wishes to minimize the quadratic

loss function H:


(15)           Minimize H =   E[c   —
                                        E(Yt)]2

where c denotes the rate of consumption which, from the budget constraint,

equals the rate of income minus the real value of additions to real cash

balances


(16)           ct=Yt_F—.

           For an analysis of this proposition see Fischer (1977).

by Gray (1976) to analyze partial wage indexation.

           The previous relationships imply that

and using (17) in (15) yields the loss function which is to be minimized

with respect to the intervention index y.

          The above analysis has not specified the value of the money stock

at the beginning of the period.                It is assumed, following Fischer (1977),

that at the beginning of each period the monetary authority changes the

money supply so as to compensate for past disturbances according to


                     =

                         kS_P*y.

Substituting (18) in GL7) and minimizing the loss function                    with respect

to y yield the following implications concerning the choice of the optimal

degree of exchange rate flexibility:

          Ci)   In   general, the optimal value of y will be within the range

(0, 1), so that the optimal exchange rate regime will correspond to neither
of the extremes of a completely fixed or of a completely flexible rate

regime.

           (ii) The intermediate solution is more likely the higher is k——the

propensity to save out of transitory income.

          (iii) When the only shocks to the system are real (a                 0), the

optimal solution is that of fixed rates Ci =              0);   and conversely, when the

only source of shocks is monetary (c =             0),   the optimal solution is that

of freely floating rates Ci        = 1).
           (iv) The higher the variance of the monetary shock, the larger will

be the optimal value of         while the higher is the variance of the real shock

shocks,   ceteris paribus, tends to raise the desirability of greater fixity of

exchange rates and    conversley     for high variance of monetary shocks.

           Table 5 contains the results of illustrative computations of the

optimal degree of the intervention index y for alternative values of ak——the

propensity to save out of transitory income——and for alternative assumptions

concerning the magnitudes of the various shocks. These results illustrate

the above propositions.

           The analysis in this section provides a simple framework for

determining the optimal degree of exchange rate flexibility. It highlights

the unique role of the stochastic structure of the economy and suggests,

therefore, that the magnitude of and the relationship between these variables

are among the determinants of the demand for reserves and should be incorporated

 into    the analysis of the demand for international reserves under a regime

 of managed float.

             As a general comment on the analysis in this section it should be

 noted that monetary policy and          foreign          exchange intervention are treated
                                        17



as close substitutes. In fact, as a first approximation, these two policies

are non—distinguishable. It is believed that this feature of the model is

much closer to reality than would be the other extreme in which monetary

policy and   foreign   exchange policies are viewed as two independent policy

instruments.

         The special role of the exchange rate should also be noted. In

the •above framework the exchange rate (and thereby the price level) is

determined by considerations of asset market equilibrium. This character-

istic is in accord with the recent developments of the asset market

approach to the analysis of exchange ratesJ3 An important limitation of

the model is the absence of an explicit incorporation of an integrated

world capital market which would relfect itself in the capital account of

the balance of payments.

         Finally, it should be noted that the present specification of the

nature of the shocks is somewhat biased in favor of government intervention

since the shocks have been presumed to originate from the instability of

the private sector rather than from the actions of government policies.

Furthermore, the concept of the optimal managed float and thereby the derived

demand for international reserves were developed as a plicy prescription for

the monetary authorities. This was motivated by realism and could be

rationalized in terms of the assumption that the monetary authorities possess

superior information concerning its own actions as well as concerning the

official holdings of international reserves. In principle, however, much

of the optimal mix could also be performed by the private sector.

Nussa (1976), Bilson (1978) and Frenkel and Johnson (1978).

                              V. Concluding Remarks

            This paper contained an analysis of the role of international reserves

under a regime of pegged exchange rates and under a regime of managed float.

It presented evidence on the stability of the demand for reserves during the

periods 1963—72 and 1973—75. It was shown that the demand for reserves by

developed    countries differs from that of less—developed countries and that the
system    underwent a structural change by the end of 1972. In       view of the drastic
changes   in the international monetary system, the extent of the structural

change    (in particular with reference to the behavior of developed countries) has
not been as large as one might have expected.14 This finding led to the obser-
vation that economic behavior seems to be more stable than legal arrangements.
The evidence show that countries have continued to hold and use international

reserves. Likewise, countries have chosen to manage their exchange rates rather

than let it float freely. From the policy perspective, it follows that the

problems concerning the   provision of international reserves and       the discussions

concerning   the role of the IMF   in   this context   are as relevant at the present

as    they were in the past.'5 The paper concluded with a sketch of a stochastic
framework for the analysis of the optimal degree of managed floating.
           The analysis in this paper would benefit from several extensions.

First, it was assumed that, during the sample period, countries were "on"

their   long—run demand functions. An extension would allow for a distinction
between short—run and long—run demand functions and would examine the determ-
inants of the speed of adjustment along the lines of Clark (l970b). Second,

         14For analyses of the effects of the move to floating exchange rates on
the demand for and the optimal provision of international reserves see Grubel
(1976), Makin (1974) and Williamson (1976). For evidence on reserve use during
the  two regimes see Suss (1976) and for a comparison of the estimated coefficients
in the Canadian case see Saidi and Earro (1977).
           l5 this issue see, however, Eaberler (1976).
                                        19



an   examination of the residuals from the estimated equations revelas the
existence of persistent negative residuals for some countries (e.g., U.K.      and
New Zealand) and positive residuals for other (e.g., Switzerland). An
                                                                      extension

would refine the grouping of countries by allowing for   country—specific    factors.

In this connection it would be of interest to test the hypothesis that countries

behave so as to trade—off large stocks of reserves for high speeds of adjustment;

some preliminary results in Bilson and Frenkel (1978) are consistent with this

hypothesis.

           Third, the specification of the demand for reserves was assumed to

remain unchanged as between the two exchange rate regimes. In principle,

however, the specification of the demand for reserves during a regime of managed

float should be derived from the analysis of the determinants of countries'

decisions concerning the degree of optimal foreign exchange intervention (i.e.,

the optimal managed float). In Section XV it was       shown that the optimal

degree of managed float depends on the details of the stochastic structure of the
various shocks which affect the economy. It suggests, therefore, that these
stochastic characteristics should be incorporated into the specification of

the demand for reserves under a regime of managed float!6

           Finally, the analytical framework underlying the literature on the

demand for international reserves needs to be tied up with the framework

underlying the literature on the monetary approach to the balance of payments.

The monetary approach to the balance of payments emphasizes the considerations

of monetary equilibrium and highlights the fact that when the monetary authori-

ties peg the rate of exchange, they lose control over the nominal monetary stock.

In many of the simplified versions of the monetary approach to the balance of

payments, credit policies are viewed as the exogenous variable which, along

with the path of the demand for money, determine (as a residual) the path of

                 the relationship between the stochastic structure of the economy
 and the estimated coefficients see Lucas (1976).

international reserves?7   In this framework little attention has been paid to
incorporating into the analysis the possibility that the monetary authorities
may have preferences concerning the composition of their assets?8 These

preferences are emphasized in the analytical framework underlying the demand

for international reserves. In that literature, however, little attention

has been paid to the conditions of monetary equilibrium. A useful extension

would combine these two strands of analysis. In such an extension, credit

policies would not be viewed as exogenous but rather, international reserves

and domestic credit would be determined jointly so as to satisfy simultaneously

equilibrium in the money market as well as equilibrium in the composition of

central banks' assets.

        '7See for example the various studies in Frenkel and Johnson (1976).
         For an exception which incorporates the monetary authorities' reaction
function into the analytical framework of the monetary approach to the balance
of payments see Ujiie (1978).

                         Reserve Holdings and the Average
                               Propensity to Import

           In this appendix I derive the relationship between long run holdings

of international reserves and the average propensity to import. It is shown

that in contrast with the implications of the simple foreign trade multiplier,

the relationship is not a clear cut one. Furthermore, it is shown that

according   to a specific interpretation of the "small country assumption,'t
there exists   a positive long run relationship between openness (the average

propensity   to import) and reserve holdings.
            Consider   the following simple two—goods model of a fully employed

economy. The economy produces and consumes the quantities [X1, X2] and

[x1, x23 respectively, and exports the first commodity. Nominal income (Y)

is:


                  —
(A.l)                  p1X1+ P2x2

where    P1 and P2 are the money prices of the two goods. Denoting a percentage

change in a variable by a circumflex (e.g., X =                  dX/X),   and using the fact that

for small changes P1IX1 + P2dX2 = 0              (the     envelope theorem), one may   write

the   percentage change in nominal income as:

 (A.2)          Y=          + e2p2

where
                                             Px                Px
                                         =    11.     '
                                                              • 22
                                     1       Y            2     Y


and             01+021.
                                          22


In equation (A.2), O denotes the relative share in production of good

I (i =   1,    2). Let consumer price level (P) be a linear homogenous function

of the money prices of goods with constant elasticities that are equal to

the relative shares of expenditures on these goods in total expenditures.

Thus:


(A.3)              =        +


where
                                       P1x1             P2x2
                                               ;
                                                   82


and

                    + 82 =   1.


In equation (A.3), 8• denotes the average propensity to consume good I

(i      1, 2). The following analysis is confined to the long run when expendi-

tures are equal to income.

              The real value of income in terms of the consumer basket is

y =   YIP;
                             +
(A.4)             y=

using (A.2) —      (A.3)   in (A.4), the percentage change in real income is


(A.5)                  (8— 02)(Pl —

Equation (A.5) emphasizes the fact that a change in the terms of trade
(p1/i'2) raises real income if the relative share in production of the good

whose relative price has risen exceeds its relative share in consumption.

In particular, since the second commodity is the imported good, 82 >           2 and
                                           23


thus when P1 —         >   0 real income rises. Using the above notations, the
                  P2
                                          —
average propensity to import is

           The stock demand for nominal cash balances (H') is assumed to

depend on the price level and on real income. This demand function is

homogenous of degree one in all prices:


(A.6)           Md =   PL(y).

The long run holdings of international reserves by the monetary authorities

is assumed to be an increasing function of the central bank's assets. For

simplicity, it is assumed that in the long run the money supply is propor-

tional to the stock of reserves as it is when the money multiplier is fixed

and when the operations of the monetary authorities are confined to pegging

the exchange rate. By an appropriate choice of units, the proportionality

factor is set to equal unity. It should be noted, however, that the

following qualitative results do not depend on this simplification.

           At   equilibrium the existing stock of cash balances (reserves) equals
the   desired stock:


(A.])           R = PL(y)


where R denotes the stock of reserves.
           The percentage change of {A.7) is


(A.8)           R = P +          n    (3L/By)yIL

where rj denotes the income elasticity of the demand for real cash balances.

Using (A.3) and (A.5) in (A.8) yields


                R=          + S2P2 ÷               —
(A.9)                                n(S2 — 82)(P1
                                            24


Equation    (A.9) expresses the proportional change in reserves as a function

of the proportional change in prices. The first two terms describe the

effects of the change in the price level due to changes in its components,

and the third term describes the effects of the change in real income due

to a change in relative prices.

            As can be seen from (A.9), for any given price level (so that the

sum of the first two terms in (A.9) vanishes), the effect of a given change

in the terms of trade on reserve holdings increases with          —
                                                                      2). On
these grounds alone one may expect to find a positive relationship between

reserves and the average propensity to import. In general, however, the

price level will also change and therefore, in addition to the value of the

parameters, the relationship depends on whether the changes are due to

variations in the price of exportables or in the price of importables. It

is in this sense that the effect of openness on reserve holdings is not a

clear cut one. However, if we adopt some variant of the "small country

assumption" and assume that the price of importables (P2) is given by the

rest of the world, then equation (A.9) can be written as:


(A.lO)             R/P = 1 -   2+   n(2 -
                                            62)

which describes the effects of a given change in price on the holdings of
                               19
international reserves.

            The effects of the magnitude of the average propensity to import

on reserve holdings can be ascertained by differentiating (A.lO) with respect

to (B2 —            An increase in the average propensity to import could result
            62).
from either a decline in the production of importables and/or from an increase


                   this variant of the "small country assumption" does not
           19Clearly,
imply that the terms of trade are fixed since the price of exportables is
determined    endogenously.

in   the consumption of importables. Thus, from (A.lO):

Equation (A.ll) states that for given consumption conditions the induced

changes in international reserves (due to a given change in export price)

are positively related to the average propensity to import, The smaller

the production of importables, the larger will be the resulting change and

thus the holdings of reserves.. Equation (A.12) states that for given

production conditions, the induced changes in international reserves are

also positively related to the average propensity to import if the income

elasticity of the demand for money does not fall short of unity.2° Cross—

sectional differences in the average propensity to import reflect differences

in both production and       consumption shares. Since empirical studies on the
demand for money suggest that, in general, 1 does not fall short of unity,

one can expect reserve holdings to depend positively on the average propensity

to import. Further, if the main differences among countries are in production

          It was previously shown (Frenkel, l974a) that in this case the
positive association between reserve holdings and the average propensity
to import will be maintained as long as n exceeds some critical number which
is smaller than unity. The difference arises from the simplification adopted
in the present analysis: the present analysis takes the change in export
prices as being the exogenous disturbance while the previous analysis allowed
export prices to be endogenously determined while taking changes in foreign
demand as the exogenous factor. In the latter case, the average propensity
to   import will also determine (via the Narshall—Lerner condition) the effect
of   a   given change   in foreign demand on the price of exportables.

patterns rather than in consumption patterns (as in the Heckscher—Ohlin;

model of international trade), equation (A.ll) implies that the positive

association between reserves and the average propensity to import will

be maintained as long as the income elasticity of the demand for money is

positive. It should, however, be emphasized that the above conclusions

have   been derived for a specific interpretation of the "small country
assumption" and for a specificassumption concerning the nature and origin
of disturbances. In general the relationship between reserve holdings and
the    average propensity to import depends on the nature and origin of

disturbances and is not clear cut. Furthermore, the formulation. in this

appendix assumes that under a pegged exchange rate system, the operation

of the monetary authorities are confined to pegging the rate and thus

yielding a "passive" path of reserves along the lines described by the

monetary   approach to the balance of payments. Consequently, the terms

used   were "reserve holdings" rather than the "demand for reserves." An
extension would modify the assumption concerning the       operations of the

monetary   authorities and would allow for   credit   policies that are aimed
at   achieving the desired stock of international reserves.

2. Definitions of Variables

         All   data   sources are from the IFS tape obtained from the International

Monetary Fund.

                                                                6
   R — International    reserves are measured in end—of—period 10 U.s. dollars.
         Reserves are defined as the sum of gold1 SDR's, foreign exchange and
         reserve position at the Fund. When reserves are reported in local
         currency, they were converted to U.S. dollars using the end—of—period
         exchange rate.

  IM — Imports are reported as cif in local currency units. These figures
         were then converted to U.s. dollars using he period average exchange
         rate. The figures used are measured in l0 U.S. dollars.

 ON? —   GNP and GOP are reported in local currency units. These figures were
         converted to U.S. dollars usin the period average exchange rate.
         The figures are measured in l0 U.S. dollars.

   m —   The average propensity to import was defined as the ratio of imports
         to ON?. When the latter was unavailable, GOP was used instead.

   a — The variability measure. To calculate the value of 4 for year T
         for a given country, the following regression was first run:
             Rt= a+ t+uovert=T—l5,...,T—1, and then using the
         estimated trend 8T' a2 was defined

                                 =           - Ri -
         (except for 1961 for which, due to lack of data, 4      is
                                                                 based on the
         previous 14 observations). Thus, a2 is defined as    the variance
         of the trend—adjusted changes in the stock of international reserves.
         A plot of the time—series of reserves revealed that the assumption
         of a linear trend seems more appropriate than that of an exponential
         trend.
