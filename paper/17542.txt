                                             ABSTRACT

What determines the sustainability of sovereign debt? We develop a model where myopic governments
seek popularity but can nevertheless commit credibly to service external debt. They do not default
when debt is low because they would lose access to debt markets and be forced to reduce spending;
they do not default as debt builds up, and net new borrowing becomes difficult, because of the adverse
consequences from default to the domestic financial sector. More myopic governments default less
often, but tax in a more distortionary way and increase the vulnerability of the domestic financial sector
to future government debt default.

        Why do governments repay external sovereign borrowing? This is a question that

has been central to discussions of sovereign debt capacity, yet the answer is still being

debated.1 Models where countries service their external debt for fear of being excluded

from capital markets for a sustained period (or some other form of harsh punishment such

as trade sanctions or invasion) seem very persuasive, yet are at odds with the fact that

defaulters seem to be able to return to borrowing in international capital markets after a

short while.2 With sovereign debt around the world at extremely high levels,

understanding why sovereigns repay foreign creditors, and what their debt capacity might

be, is an important concern for policy makers and investors. This paper attempts to

address these issues.

        A number of recent papers offer a persuasive explanation of why some countries

service their debt even if they are not likely to experience coordinated punishment by

lenders.3 As more and more of a country’s debt is held by domestic financial institutions,

or is critical to facilitating domestic financial transactions because it is perceived as low-

risk interest bearing collateral, default on sovereign bonds becomes costly; Default

automatically hurts domestic activity by rendering domestic banks insolvent, or reducing

activity in financial markets (see especially Bolton and Jeanne (2011) or Gennaioli,

Martin, and Rossi (2011)). If the government cannot default selectively on foreign

holders of its debt only, either because it does not know who owns what, or it cannot

track sales by foreigners to domestics (see Guembel and Sussman (2009) and Broner,

  See, for example Eichengreen (1987), Sandleris, Gelos, and Sahay (2004), and Arellano (2009). Ozler
(1993) and Flandreau and Zumer (2004) find that increased premia on debt of past defaulters are too small
to suggest strong incentives to pay.

Martin, and Ventura (2010) for rationales), then it has a strong incentive to avoid default

and make net debt repayments to all, including foreign holders of its debt.

        What is less clear is why a country with a relatively underdeveloped financial

sector or with its sovereign debt largely financed by external lenders, and hence little

direct costs of default, would be willing to service its debt. Of course, one could appeal to

reputation models where governments strive to maintain the long-term reputation of their

country even though default is tempting. However, we are more realistic (or perhaps

cynical). Most governments care only about the short run, with horizons limited by

elections or other forms of political mortality – such short termism is perhaps most

famously epitomized by Louis XV when he proclaimed “Apres moi, le deluge!” (After

me, the flood.) Short-horizon governments are unlikely to see any merit in holding off

default solely because their future reputation will be higher – after all, the benefits of that

reputation will be reaped only by future governments.

        Short termism may, however, help in another way that explains why countries

with little current cost of defaulting, still continue to service their debt. Short horizon

governments do not care about a growing accumulation of debt that has to be serviced –

they can pass it on to the successor government – but they do care about current cash

flows. So long as cash inflows from new borrowing exceed old debt service, they are

willing to continue servicing the debt because it provides net new resources. Default

would only shut off the money spigot, as renegotiations drag on, for much of the duration

of their remaining expected time in government. This may explain why some

governments continue servicing debt even though a debt restructuring, and a write-off of

the debt stock, may be so much more beneficial for the long-term growth of the country.



                                               4
        At the same time, short horizon governments also have the incentive to set up

entanglements between sovereign debt and the domestic financial sector that increase

their current capacity to borrow, even while ensuring future governments make net

repayments and incur any costs of distress. Thus we have a simple rationale for why

countries may be able to borrow despite the absence of any visible mode of current

punishment other than a temporary suspension of lending; foreign lenders anticipate the

country will eventually be subject to higher domestic costs of defaulting, and will then

service its accumulated debt. In the meantime, the country’s short-horizon government is

unlikely to be worried about debt accumulation, so long as lenders are willing to lend it

enough to roll over its old debts plus a little more. Knowing this, creditors are willing to

lend to it today.

        Key in this narrative, and a central focus of our analysis, are the policies that a

government has to follow to convince creditors that it, and future governments, will not

default. To ensure that the country’s debt capacity grows, it has to raise the future

government’s ability to pay (that is, ensure the future government has enough revenues)

as well as raise its willingness to pay (that is, ensure the future penalties to default

outweigh the benefits of not paying). The need to tap debt markets for current spending

thus gives even the myopic government a stake in the future. When the binding

constraint is the ability to pay, this stake in the future leads to more growth-friendly

policies from myopic governments compared to the case when they have no access to

debt market: even myopic governments lower tax rates in order to boost long-term

(production and) revenues, so as to borrow and spend more today.




                                               5
       However, the policies that myopic government follows when the binding

constraint is the willingness to pay potentially reduce the country’s growth as well as

increase its exposure to risk. For instance, myopic governments choose a higher tax rate

(or equivalently, a higher degree of financial repression), which will lead to lower real

investment by the corporate sector, and therefore lower resources for a future government

to tax, and a lower ability to pay. But it will also lead to more financial savings (because

these typically escape the heavy taxes production is subject to), a larger holding of

government bonds by domestic entities, and thus a greater willingness of the future

government to service its debt for fear of doing widespread damage to the economy

through default.

       In deciding whether to service its legacy sovereign external debt or not, a myopic

government has to trade off the benefits from added resources -- if it decides to service

the debt and can raise new debt -- against the distortions from taxing the economy so as

to preserve access to debt markets. We trace out the maximum debt that countries will be

able to service.

       Interestingly, as a government becomes less myopic and discounts the future less,

its willingness to default on legacy debt increases. Default costs go up over time as a

country’s financial markets depend more on government debt. Therefore, not only does

the long-horizon government anticipate rising default costs, it also internalizes the future

cost of paying back borrowing, as well as the distortions that stem from tax policies

required to expand debt capacity. This makes borrowing less attractive, and since the

ability to borrow more is the only reason for a government to service legacy foreigner-

held debt, the long-horizon developing country government has more incentive to default



                                              6
(or less capacity to borrow in the first place). Similarly, countries with a more productive

technology may also have lower debt capacity because the distortionary taxation needed

to sustain access to debt markets will be more costly for such countries.4

         Finally, we also allow the government to determine the vulnerability of the

financial sector to government default. We show that shorter horizon governments have

a greater incentive to create more vulnerability, in part because the future costs of default

will not be borne by them, while the benefit of greater debt capacity will. Thus myopia is

again important in creating debt capacity. We offer some examples in the paper.

        It is useful to compare the implications of our model to the implications of

existing models of external sovereign debt. In many of these models (see, for example,

Eaton and Gersowitz (1981)), the cost of defaulting on foreign debt, either in terms of

sanctions, exclusion from financial markets, or costs of higher future risk premia, have to

be very high to outweigh the benefit of defaulting on the enormous stock of debt. Hence,

for example, “trigger” strategy models require punishment for a large number of periods

if the borrower defaults. In our paper, though, the assumption of short government

horizon ensures that the government emerging from poverty never internalizes the cost of

repaying the entire stock of debt (or equivalently, the benefit from defaulting on it when

default costs are low). All it cares about is whether the expected cash inflows from

retaining access to the external debt market is positive over the remaining term of the




4
  Greater borrowing by developing countries need not be associated with better fundamentals. Studies show
that correcting for the obvious factors, developing countries that are more dependent on external financing
seem to grow relatively slower (see, for example, Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007)), a puzzle that
Aguiar and Amador (2009) suggest is explained by the government’s worry about the adverse
consequences of debt overhang on the private sector).


                                                    7
government. If it is, the government will continue servicing debt, even if the only cost of

default is the disruption of credit markets for a short while.5

         Bulow and Rogoff (1989b) show that the reputational arguments for repayment

break down because by defaulting and investing potential repayments in asset markets to

self-insure when net repayments have to be made, a country can guarantee itself higher

consumption if it defaults than in if it does not. Anticipation of such default should

preclude a country from borrowing in the first place.

         In a sense, our initial government with low default costs is a special case of

Bulow-Rogoff, but our model clarifies that borrowing need not be impossible so long as

future governments have the ability and willingness to pay too – which the current

government ensures. Of course, if countries face default costs only in the future, long-

horizon governments would have little incentive to service debt, preferring to default on

the stock and have it written down before it becomes enforceable. Our assumption of

government myopia explains why countries do not default even when default costs are

small. Our model then implies a feasible time profile of repayments that cannot be

exceeded.6

         Amador (2008) also argues that the Bulow-Rogoff no-borrowing equilibrium

breaks down. In his model, countries do not consist of representative agents but self-

interested interest groups. Because each one cannot be trusted to not grab surplus savings,

the country cannot stop debt repayments and purchase insurance with them in the market.


5
  Indeed, that developing country governments myopically service their debts too long is consistent with
the findings in Levy-Yeyati and Panizza (2006) that growth starts picking up in countries almost
immediately after they default, while output declines steadily before. Of course, another explanation is the
equilibrium one that only countries that benefit from default do so.
6
  Acharya and Rajan (in progress) solve for a time structure of debt repayments in an infinite horizon
dynamic model that formalizes this intuition.

                                                      8
In fact, the interest groups may prefer to maintain access to a credit line that supplies

funds in dire contingencies, and hence do not default. The inability of interest groups to

do what is collectively optimal (the Bulow-Rogoff equilibrium) thus makes debt

sustainable.

       There are similarities as well as differences between Amador’s model and ours.

For instance, in our model the myopic government does not default on legacy debt

because the costs of repayment are borne entirely by future governments whereas only

some of the gains from default are current and the rest realized in the long run through

improved investment. In contrast, in Amador (2008), interest groups do not default

because they are unsure of being able to reap the benefits even in the short run. Further,

the current government in our model determines the size of domestic debt market and

financial-sector vulnerability, which effectively determines the costs of default for future

governments, allowing it to not only repay the legacy debt but borrow beyond and spend

for populist reasons. Implications arising from this forward-backward interaction

between governments are unique to our model.

       We present the model in section I and solve it in section II, explore alternative

assumptions in section III, draw out implications in section IV, and conclude in section

V.

                                           I. The model


       Consider a world with three dates (t = 0, 1, 2) and two periods. The country that

we focus on has pre-existing external sovereign debt of amount D0 . We assume this is

entirely foreign borrowing, and is repayable to foreigners at end of the first period.



                                              9
Households and corporations (collectively known as the private sector) have an

endowment of E0 .

          We model the private sector as a representative corporation that has access to a

production technology which, in return for an investment k1 during period 1, produces a

return in the short run (end of period 1) of f1 (k1 ) as well as in the long run (end of period

2) of f 2 (k1 ) , with fxc ! 0,   fxcc 0 . The remaining resources, E0  k1 , represent financial

savings which are invested in government bond markets or in the global capital markets.

We assume universal risk-neutrality and a time preference rate of r, which is thus the cost

of borrowing in domestic as well as foreign debt markets. The private sector has a slight

home bias, so if expected returns between the domestic market and foreign markets are

equal, it prefers investing in the domestic market.

          We assume the politicians in the government discount the future using factor Ⱦ‫א‬

       1               1
ሾͲǡ        ሿǤhenȾൌ      ǡwe have a long-horizon government which has the same rate of
      1 r            1 r

time preference as the market. When ȕ=0, we have a short-horizon myopic government,

which will be our focus initially. Such a government does not consider the effects of its

actions over the long term. Its myopic behavior could be explained by finite government

lives, or eventual elections with little weight placed on continuation post-election.

          Government leaders want to maximize spending so as to keep people happy while

they rule. Such spending could be blatant attempts at populism (a deeper question we do

not address is why populism is popular). Spending could also occur where there is short-

run opacity about true economic outcomes – if it takes talented leadership to create

sustainable jobs, the run-of-the-mill politician may spend on make-work jobs so long as


                                                  10
the public has a hard time distinguishing the two in the short run. Everyone knows the

average politician spends on such jobs, and it is inefficient, but if he does not do so, he

will be identified immediately as incompetent and punished by public opinion.

         The government can raise money for spending in two ways. First, it can levy taxes

on the private sector of up to t Max every period on the cash flows generated from real

investment – we assume this reflects the political and economic capacity of the

government to collect tax revenues. We assume financial investments (in government

bonds) by the private sector are not taxed.7 We will argue later that the tax t can also be

thought of as the degree of financial repression in the economy, forcing the private sector

to hold government bonds.

         The government can either default on its external sovereign debt at the beginning

of the period or decide to pay it back. If it defaults on its debt, the debt is written off but

credit markets are disrupted and the country cannot borrow again until next period when

it will be ruled by the next government. If the first-period government does not default on

its legacy debt D0 , it can borrow an amount D1 that is payable at date 2 by the second-

period government. The first-period government uses the proceeds of the new debt

issued, as well as the taxes raised, to make committed debt repayments as well as to fund

its spending.




7
  Equivalently, there is a uniform income tax, and the government levies an additional set of taxes such as
payroll taxes or excise duties on real investment projects. Financial investments are typically subject to
lower taxation, partly because of their greater mobility in a country with an open capital account. An
equivalent formulation would be for the government to favor (through a lower tax on interest income on
government bonds held by the private sector) or mandate (through prudential norms on banks) private
sector holdings of government bonds. In any such formulation, the net effect of such a policy would be
lower private sector investment in real assets.

                                                    11
         We assume new debt D1 is in the form of bearer bonds which are issued to both

foreign and domestic investors. Let the amount foreign investors buy be denoted as D1For

and the amount domestic investors buy be D1Dom with D1                    D1For  D1Dom . We assume that

there is no cost of defaulting on government debt held by foreigners, other than that of

disrupting the credit markets and eliminating further access to them this period. There is,

however, a cost to the second-period government of defaulting on domestically held

government debt which, in reduced form, results in the government spending z

D1Dom (1  r ) less on populist measures, where z > 1. For instance, disruption of the

domestic financial sector would render the payment and settlements system defunct,

preventing generation of the private sector output altogether and in turn precluding any

tax proceeds and government expenditures.8

         The parameter z captures both the vulnerability of the domestic financial sector to

government bond default, as well as the consequences of financial sector distress for

economic activity. There may be differences across countries in z . Vulnerability is likely

to be high in developed countries. Developed country financial systems are typically

more interconnected, arm’s length, and market based, with the credit worthiness of

financial sector participants of critical importance in supporting the high transaction

volume. Any hint that any of the players could be impaired as a result of losses on their

holdings of government assets could lead to questions about their creditworthiness, and a

dramatic fall in financial activity and hence economic output (see, for example,

8
  To avoid this, the government would have to bail out the financial sector, a cost that would be increasing
(more than one for one) in the domestic financial sector’s liabilities, even if it could find the funds. Given
its low credibility, the government might have to look for funds from international lenders of last resort,
with the associated costs of conditionality. Alternatively, it might have to accept the failure of a portion of
the financial sector with an associated multiplicative decline in economic activity. All these costs are
captured in z.

                                                      12
Gennaioli, Martin and Rossi (2011)). For any given size of government bonds held by the

financial sector, the cost of government default could be high in rich countries because

many transactions are disrupted. Another channel could be that government bonds are

collateral (see Bolton and Jeanne (2011)) for transactions where even the slight hint of

default risks could make transaction costs prohibitive. Again, many such transactions are

likely to take place in a rich country’s financial system.

        In developing countries, there may be few financial institutions. However, each

one may play a critical role in the credit-starved economy. Even though the financial

sector may account for a much smaller fraction of economic activity because financial

penetration is low, there may be few alternative sources of credit to financial institutions,

and their multiplier effect on economic activity may be high. Therefore, whether z is, on

average, higher in a developed or developing country is debatable. What is clear is that

both kinds of countries have some ability to impose costs on themselves of default. We

will allow vulnerability z to be endogenously determined later in the paper. The timeline

of the model is in Figure 1.

                               II. Solving for Debt and Default

We solve the model backwards. Since date 2 is the last period, the second-period

government cannot borrow, and will repay existing debt if the cost of default exceeds the

funds repaid, that is if,

                                  D1 (1  r ) d zD1Dom (1  r ).                           (1)


This represents the country’s willingness to pay. Since D1         D1For  D1Dom , the

willingness-to-pay constraint can also be expressed as a constraint on the foreign


                                               13
borrowing of the first-period government D1For d ( z  1) D1Dom , which is why we require z

to be greater than 1.

          Furthermore, at date 2, the second-period government will raise taxes to the

maximum possible so that t2       t Max . The government therefore has the ability to pay its

debt if

                                      D1 (1  r ) d t Max f 2 (k1 ).                         (2)


(1) and (2) are the key constraints in determining future debt capacity.

          Now let us fold back to date 1 when the first-period government has to choose

whether to default or not on initial debt D0 , the tax rate t1 , and the amount of debt it will

borrow, D1 , if it has not defaulted. For the purpose of solving the model at date 1, the

second-period government’s debt capacity – in particular whether the second-period

government is constrained in repayments by its ability to pay or by its willingness to pay

– effectively determines the first-period government’s debt capacity. The novel feature

of our model, as we explain next, is that the constraint faced by the second-period

government depends upon – and is in fact strategically set – by the first-period

government, through the effect of its fiscal policy on second-period output and size of

domestic debt to be repaid by the second-period government.

2.1. Corporate Investment and First-period Government’s Maximization Problem

          Start first with the private sector’s investment incentives. The representative

corporation maximizes the present value of its post-tax cash flows net of the cost of




                                                   14
investment, discounted at the opportunity rate from lending in the government bond

market9:

                                    1                              1
                        max k1            (1  t1 ) f1 (k1 )             (1  t2 ) f 2 (k1 )  k1.          (3)
                                 (1  r )                      (1  r ) 2


Clearly k1 d E0 for external borrowing by the government to be feasible (external

borrowing is infeasible if there is no domestically-held government debt going into the

last date, and a positive level of domestically-held government debt requires domestic

private sector financial savings, so k1  E0 ). Assume E0 high enough that the inequality

holds.10 In particular, this implies that the private sector has net savings that go into the

government bond market.

         Then, the first-order condition for corporate investment satisfies

                      1                                1
                            (1  t1 ) f1 c (k1 )             (1  t2 ) f 2 c (k1 )  1 0.                   (4)
                   (1  r )                        (1  r ) 2
We denote the solution to (4) as k1* (t1 , t2 ) . Corporate investment k1* (t1 , t2 ) obviously

decreases in the level of tax rates t1 and t2. Since t2                   t Max throughout, in what follows we

adopt the simpler notation k1* (t1 ) .

         Now consider the myopic government’s objective of maximizing spending this

period. If it does not intend to default, it will solve

                                    max D ,t D1  D0 (1  r )  t1 f1 (k1* (t1 ))                            (5)
                                            1 1




9
  There are two possible interpretations of this objective function; (i) It assumes public debt is set such that
the government does not default (consistent with finding the debt capacity of the economy), and (ii) The
costs of government default fall on the representative household, which receives all the dividends in the
economy but does not make investment decisions. Investment decisions are made by a value maximizing
management.
10
   The assumption is needed because we focus on a two-period model. Clearly, in the period before date 0,
foreign investors are willing to lend without any accompanying private sector savings, anticipating that a
future government will create the financial sector entanglements that ensure eventual net repayments.

                                                           15
subject to constraints (1) and (2).

         If the government does intend to default on its debt, it expects to be shut out from

the debt market and will maximize

                            max t1   t1 f1 ( k1* (t1 ))                                     (6)

         We first assume no default, then the case with default, and compare the two to

determine the default decision.

2.2. No default by first-period government

         Clearly, assuming they do not expect default, government debt bought by

domestic investors in the first period will equal domestic private savings (given their mild

home bias, they do not invest abroad if expected returns are equalized), so

D1Dom     ( E0  k1* ) . Substituting into the willingness-to-pay constraint, we get

D1 d z ( E0  k1* (t1 )).

         Now, consider the government’s decision. Since the government derives benefits

from spending, it wishes to borrow as much as possible until one of the two constraints

binds. Depending upon which constraint binds first, the remaining part of the program –

choosing the tax rate – can be analyzed separately under each constraint. Before we

analyze each case separately, we consider which constraint – ability to pay or willingness

to pay – binds and when.



Constrained by ability to pay or willingness to pay?

As the first-period tax rate ( t1 ) is varied, the ability-to-pay constraint binds before

willingness-to-pay constraint if and only if



                                                          16
                                    1
                                          t2Max f 2 ( k1* (t1 )) d z ( E0  k1* (t1 )).                    (7)
                                 (1  r )

Given that k * decreases in t1 , we have

Lemma 1: There exists a level of corporate tax rate in the first period, t1 , such that only

the ability-to-pay constraint binds if t1 ! t1 and only the willingness-to-pay constraint

binds if t1  t1 . The threshold level t1 is decreasing in the starting endowment E0 and

deadweight cost of default z.

The intuition is straightforward. As the corporate tax rate rises, investment falls,

reducing the next government’s tax proceeds. Simultaneously, domestic financial

savings increase, allowing government domestic borrowing to increase, increasing the

deadweight costs suffered by next government from defaulting on sovereign debt, and

increasing the willingness to pay. Thus, at high corporate tax rates, it is the ability-to-pay

constraint that binds. Conversely, at low tax rates, the willingness-to-pay constraint

binds.11

Binding Ability To Pay

When the binding constraint is the ability to pay, the first-period government’s

maximization problem is given by

                                           1
                               max t1            t2Max f 2 ( k1* (t1 ))  t1 f1 ( k1* (t1 )).              (8)
                                        (1  r )


Effectively, the current government chooses the tax rate to maximize the proceeds of

taxes in both periods since it can borrow against next period’s tax proceeds by taking on

11
   Clearly, if the government could levy substantial wealth taxes, its ability to pay would not be a constraint
at ordinary levels of external debt. Implicit in our formulation is that the economic and political costs of
confiscating wealth are embedded in the maximum tax rate that we assume feasible.

t1A , satisfies the first-order condition: 12

               dk1*
Note that           < 0. At low tax rates, proceeds increase in tax rate (the direct effect of a
               dt1

higher marginal tax rate), but if the tax rate becomes very large, the indirect effects as it

reduces corporate investment dominate – the Laffer Curve effect. With standard

concavity of the optimization problem we have

Lemma 2: In the region where only the ability-to-pay constraint binds, the first-period

government’s optimal tax rate is given by t1A , which solves (9), and is unaffected by the

starting endowment E0 and deadweight cost of default z.

Next, we consider the solution when the willingness to pay is the binding constraint.

Optimal Taxes and Borrowing in the Willingness-to-pay Region

In this case, the first-period government’s problem is

                                       max t1 t1 f1 ( k1* (t1 ))  z ( E0  k1* (t1 ))                             (10)


Now, the government’s tax rate choice becomes interesting. It can no longer borrow

fully against next government’s tax revenues as the next government is constrained by its

willingness to repay public debt. On the one hand, the current government may want to

lower the tax rate to induce the corporate sector to invest more, thus allowing the taxable


                                                                                             d 2 k1*

     A sufficient condition to ensure the second-order condition is negative is that                  0 . Using

                                                              18
revenues to increase. This is the incentive effect of lower taxes. On the other hand,

lowering the corporate tax rate shrinks the financial savings in the economy, shrinking

the domestic appetite for government debt, reducing the next government’s willingness to

pay, and in turn the current government’s ability to borrow. Put differently, the short-

horizon government may want to “crowd out” private real investment (and economic

growth) in an attempt to increase its short-term borrowing and spending capacity.

            The optimal tax rate trades off these two effects. We denote the solution to this

program as t1W and it satisfies the first-order condition: 13

                                                                     dk *
                                            ª¬  z  t1 f1' (k1* ) º¼ 1  f1 (k1* ) 0.                       (11)
                                                                     dt1


Lemma 3: In the region where only the willingness-to-pay constraint binds, the first-

period government’s optimal tax rate t1W satisfies (11), and is not affected by the starting

endowment E0 , but is increasing in deadweight cost of default z.

           Note that the effect of tax t is to alter the choice between real investments and

investments in government bonds. Alternatively, instead of taxing investments directly,

the government could force the financial sector to absorb its bonds, thus crowding out the

private sector investment. Financial repression results in an implicit tax, the foregone

private investment, which is equivalent in reduced form to what we model as a direct tax

and economic repression. Thus t could be thought of as the extent of financial repression.

Optimal Taxes and New Borrowing

                                                                                              d 2 k1*

always met when       f1'''  0, f 2'''  0 .


                                                               19
Comparing the first-order condition in the willingness-to-pay region (11) with that in the

ability-to-pay region (9), it follows that t1A < t1W . Intuitively, raising taxes in the ability-to-

pay region lowers debt capacity, while it increases debt capacity in the willingness-to-pay

region. Therefore, the optimal tax is higher in the latter. Combining the analysis,



Proposition 1: Conditional on not defaulting, the first-period government chooses a tax

rate t1* where (i) t1*   t1A , if t1W t t1A ! t1 ; (ii) t1*   t1 , if t1W t t1 t t1A ; and, (iii) t1*   t1W

otherwise. Further, new government borrowing D1* is given by the condition:

                                    ª 1                                                     º
                         D1*    min «          t2Max f 2 ( k1* (t1* )), z E0  k1* (t1* )   »,                (12)
                                    ¬ (1  r )                                              ¼

where k1* (t1* ) satisfies (4) for t1    t1* .

To understand the solution better, let us consider how it varies as we change the starting

endowment E0 and the sophistication of the financial sector z, which determines the

deadweight cost of default. As Lemma 1 indicates, the threshold level t1 is decreasing in

the starting endowment as well as the sophistication of the financial sector. We can show



Corollary 1: If the starting endowment E0 is sufficiently low, that is, below some

threshold level E0 , then the economy is in the willingness-to-pay region ,with t1 ! t1W t t1A

, and as E0 increases, neither the tax rate t1* nor investment k1* (t1* ) increase. Government

borrowing D1* , however, increases. As E0 increases above the threshold E0 but is below a

higher threshold E0 , t1W t t1 t t1A ,and both ability-to-pay and willingness-to-pay

constraints bind. The tax rate t1* now falls as E0 increases, and government borrowing

                                                        20
continues to increase. Finally, when E0 ! E0 , the economy is in the ability-to-pay region,

with t1W t t1A ! t1 . In this region again, as endowment E0 increases, the tax rate t1* ,

investment k1* (t1* ) , and government borrowing D1* all remain unaffected.



           Consider a simple example that allows us to illustrate Proposition 1 and Corollary

1. Let f1 (k ) DT k J , f 2 (k ) (1  D )T k J , where D  (0,1), T ! 0, J  (0,1). 14 Let

D       0.75,T    3, J        0.66, t Max   0.6 75 (for both periods), r   0.05, E0     1.0, z 1.1 .

           As Figure 2a suggests, optimal tax rates (assuming no default for now), given by

t1* , decrease in the endowment for intermediate values of the endowment (when both

constraints bind simultaneously); additional endowments increase willingness to pay, so

tax rates have to fall for the economy’s ability to pay to keep pace. However, the

relationship is flat both for very high and very low levels of endowment. This is because

the optimal tax when only one of the constraints binds is independent of endowments.15

           In Figure 2b, we plot the end-of-period 1 endowment of the economy as a

function of initial endowment, for two cases: when the government experiences autarky

(if it defaults, or alternatively, if there is no sovereign debt market) and when it can

borrow (if it does not default and it has access to a sovereign debt market). Interestingly,

the economy with access grows at a lower rate than the autarkic economy when the

endowment is low, but at a faster rate when the endowment is large. This is because of

the optimal myopic tax policy in the two regions as shown in Figure 2a: the tax rate in the

14
     Closed form expressions for the example are in the appendix B.
15
     Note that at very low levels of endowment, the unconstrained optimal tax rate   t1W can exceed t Max so that
t1* is truncated at t Max .

                                                         21
willingness-to-pay region is higher than the autarkic tax rate, but the tax rate in the

ability-to-pay region is lower than the autarkic tax rate.

       Intuitively, access to sovereign debt lengthens the horizons of even myopic

governments when endowments are high as they adopt a growth-friendly tax policy in

order to boost long-term revenues, so as to borrow against them today for spending. In

contrast, government myopia combined with access to sovereign debt leads to lower

growth when endowments are low, because tax policy aims to induce greater savings in

government bonds (and thus greater government spending) and less private sector

investment. Put differently, ceteris paribus, poor countries may be more repressive, which

further slows growth.

       We turn now to debt capacity. As Figure 3 suggests, new government borrowing

D1* increases for low and moderate levels of endowment when the binding constraint is

the willingness to pay, and the marginal addition to endowment goes into the domestic

debt market, thus expanding debt capacity. However, there is no effect on debt at high

levels of endowment – for countries with large endowments, debt is capped by their

ability to pay, which is not affected at the margin by the additional endowments going

into the domestic debt market.

       In Figures 4 and 5, instead of varying endowment, we vary the productivity

parameter T . In Figure 4, at low productivity levels, the economy’s ability to pay is the

constraint, whereas at high productivity levels, its willingness to pay is the constraint. In

the region where both bind, the optimal tax increases in productivity – higher

productivity means more goes to real investment, which means higher taxes are needed

for funds to flow to the financial sector.


                                              22
       Less intuitive is that D1* is non-monotone in productivity (see Figure 5), rising

initially and falling eventually. That new government borrowing rises with productivity

in the ability-to-pay region is natural given that the more productive private sector will

produce greater cash flows in the future, which alleviates the constraint. In the

willingness-to-pay region, however, the short-horizon government has to tax harshly so

as to boost domestic financial savings. When productivity is high, the required tax rate to

maintain a commensurate willingness to pay can be substantial, and debt capacity D1* can

fall with productivity.

       We can also characterize what happens as the parameter z representing the

deadweight cost of default varies.

Corollary 2: If the deadweight cost parameter z is sufficiently low, that is, below some

threshold level z , then the economy is in the willingness-to-pay region and as z

increases, government borrowing D1* and the tax rate t1* increase, while investment k1* (t1* )

decreases. As z increases above the threshold z but is below a higher threshold z ,

t1W ! t1 ! t1A ,and both constraints bind. The tax rate t1* now falls as z increases, and

government borrowing continues to increase. Finally, if z increases over the threshold z ,

then the economy is in the ability-to-pay region. In this region, as z increases,

government borrowing D1* , the tax rate t1* and investment k1* (t1* ) remain constant.

       Interestingly, the relationship between the deadweight cost parameter and the tax

rate is non-monotonic, reflecting the effects of differing binding constraints. In particular,

in the region where the willingness to pay binds, an increase in z increases the ability of




                                              23
the government to borrow in proportion to the amounts that go into financial savings,

giving it a greater incentive to tax real corporate investment.

        The remaining step is to analyze when the first-period government chooses to

default versus repaying the legacy debt. We turn to that now.

2.3.No-default level of legacy debt

    In case the government chooses to default, it is shut out from the debt markets. Its

total resources available for spending come only from tax collection but it is free from

repaying the debt of the past. Therefore, conditional on default, it chooses t1 to solve

                                              max t1 t1 f1 (k1* (t1 )).                       (13)

The solution to this problem is denoted as t1** and it satisfies the first-order condition:

                                           dk1*
                                  t f (k )
                                       1 1
                                          '
                                                 f1 ( k1* ) 0.
                                                *
                                                1                                       (14)
                                           dt1
Note the tax rate conditional on an intent to default is in between the low tax rate when

the government wants to enhance the future government’s ability to pay debt, and the

higher tax rate if it wants to enhance the future government’s willingness to pay debt.

The first-period government defaults if and only if

                          t1** f1 (k1* (t1** ) t D1*  D0 (1  r )  t1* f1 (k1* (t1* )).     (15)

On inspection, we see:

Proposition 2: There is a threshold level of date-0 (legacy) debt D0Max such that the first-

period government defaults on this debt if and only if D0 t D0Max , where D0Max is the value

of D0 that equates both sides of (15), and where in turn D1* and t1* are as described in

Proposition 1, t1** satisfies (14), and k1* (t1 ) solves (4). The no-default level of legacy debt



                                                        24
D0Max is (weakly) increasing in the initial endowment E0 and the deadweight cost of

default, z.

         In other words, we obtain the natural result that short-horizon governments are

more likely to default following an adverse endowment shock, which reduces the

willingness to pay of successor governments, and hence the ability to borrow today.

Similarly, they are also more likely to default if the likely damage to the domestic

financial sector from a future default is smaller, constraining their ability to borrow

today.

         We plot D0Max for different values of endowment in Figure 3 and for different

values of productivity in Figure 5. D0Max is always weakly below D1* , because the

government finds deviations from the short-term revenue-maximizing tax rate to enhance

debt capacity worthwhile only if it produces a net inflow from the debt markets. D0Max is

equal to D1* only when parameters are such that the government selects the short-term

revenue-maximizing tax rate even when it is trying to maximize D1* . Finally, as with debt

capacity D1* , the default point D0Max is also increasing in endowments but non-monotone

(first increasing and then decreasing) in private sector’s productivity. We also plot the

tax rate t1** that the short-term government charges if it defaults on legacy debt. This tax

rate is invariant in endowment (Figure 2), and under the specific functional form for the

example also invariant in productivity (Figure 4), and lies in between the tax rates

charged absent default at the extreme values of endowment and productivity.

                            III. Alternative Assumptions

         Let us now examine alternative assumptions to those made in our model.

                                             25
3.1. Variable Horizon

        A key assumption is that the government is myopic. Let us now compare the

short-horizon government’s decision to default with that of a long-horizon government,

which cares about spending in both periods. Interestingly, a long-horizon government

defaults more, that is, over a greater parameter range than a short-horizon government.

Alternatively, the myopic government would be able to borrow more at date 1 than a

long-horizon government.

        Formally, the government’s objective function with a discount factor E ! 0 is

                  > D1  D0 (1  r )@  E D1 (1  r )  t1 f1   k1 (t1 )  E t2 f 2 k1 (t1 )   (16)


                           1
By inspection, if E              , then a long-horizon government sees no benefit in bringing
                        (1  r )

forward spending by borrowing, since that cuts into future spending. So it gets no benefit

from having continued access to debt markets. As a result, it does not want to repay the

legacy debt, and will always default. Now let us turn to see what happens at lower levels

of Ⱦ. We will show that the amount of legacy debt it is willing to service falls in ȾǤ

        When the government’s borrowing is constrained by its ability to pay, it can

                                                         t2 f 2
borrow up to second period revenues, so D1                      . Substituting in (16), the
                                                         1 r

government’s maximization simplifies to (8), which is just the short-horizon

government’s problem. So t1A,E       0
                                         t1A, E !0 . This should not be surprising because, as we

noted earlier, the ability to borrow in the debt markets effectively lengthens the short-

horizon government’s horizon, and makes it fully internalize long-term revenue when

ability to pay is the constraint.


                                                    26
          However, the government’s objective function when only the willingness to pay

constraint binds is not the same as that of the short-horizon government. In that region,

D1   z ( E0  k1* (t1 )) . Substituting in (16) and differentiating w.r.t. t1 , we get

                                                                               *

Comparing with (11), we see that t1W ,E           0
                                                      ! t1W , E !0 . Moreover, differentiating w.r.t. Ⱦ and

                                                      d t1W , E !0
using the envelope theorem, we see that                             0 ; As the government cares more
                                                        dE

about the future, the tax rate it sets in the willingness-to-pay region falls. This is because

it internalizes to a greater extent the distortions stemming from the higher tax rate needed

to move resources into the financial sector so as to ensure greater willingness to pay for

future governments. Note also that t1 , which is the tax rate demarcating the boundary

between the willingness to pay region and the ability to pay region, does not vary with Ⱦ.

This means that as E rises, the government moves from not being constrained by the

willingness to pay to being constrained by the willingness to pay.

          Finally, if the government decides to default, it sets t1 to maximize

                                    G { t1 f1 k1 (t1 )  E t2 f 2 k1 (t1 ) .                             (18)

                                1                                     1

                                                         27
The first term in square brackets on the right hand side is the effective spending benefit

from new borrowing. The shorter is the horizon, the larger the government sees this to be.

The second term, which is negative, is the reduction in spending from the fall in tax

revenue as taxes are distorted to expand debt capacity. Thus the government is willing to

service more legacy debt if the perceived benefits of new borrowing are high and the

perceived costs of the fall in tax revenue are low. Differentiating w.r.t. Ⱦ, we get :



Proposition 3: As the government’s discount factor ߚ increases, the maximum legacy

                                                    1
debt D0 Max it is willing to repay falls. When E        , the government is not willing to

repay any legacy debt, that is, D0 Max   0 . The amount the government can borrow, D1* ,

also decreases in E .

        Therefore lengthening horizons reduces the attractiveness of repaying legacy debt

at date 0. With longer horizons, new borrowing is less attractive because, first, the

government internalizes to a greater extent the future costs of repaying new debt, and,

second, the government sees diminished revenues, both today and in the future, from

setting the higher tax rate today that is needed to signal its willingness to pay. Longer

horizons reduce the first-period government’s debt capacity (and of governments before

it). By contrast, a short-horizon government will default under fewer circumstances

because it values the benefits from immediate expenditures while disregarding the costs

of new borrowing and lower future revenues, which largely fall on future governments.

It will also borrow more at date 1.




                                              28
         Figures 6a and 6b illustrate for the parameters in our example how tax policy and

debt capacity behave as a function of E , the inverse of government myopia, as

endowment is varied. Figures 7a and 7b repeat the exercise as private sector’s

productivity is varied. As E rises, the government becomes more long-horizon in its

decision-making. Its optimal tax rate given no default falls (so does its borrowing D1* in

this case) and the maximum amount of legacy debt it will pay, D0Max , falls as well.

3.2. Valuable Government Spending and the Benefits of Short Horizons

         Note that without any economic role for government spending, even the long-

horizon government’s taxation policy is suboptimal relative to the first-best, which is

simply to have no taxes whatsoever. This, however, is again just for simplicity and our

qualitative comparisons would hold even if we added a multiplier on government

spending. Specifically, suppose government spending yields value that is m times the

spending. Then, the objective function of the government (no matter of what type) does

not change since all spending is multiplied by m. However, when m is greater than one

but not too large, some government spending is efficient, and its level is obtained by

equating the marginal return of private sector’s capital investment to the multiplier on

government spending.16

         If some government spending is efficient, then a government could benefit its

country by generating some additional debt capacity. Note that a short horizon


16
   When the multiplier is sufficiently large, it may be first-best efficient to have all spending be done by the
government rather than some real investments being made by the private sector. If the multiplier is not too
large, the private sector equates the present value of the after tax cash flows on the marginal dollar invested
                                                                                              1
to 1. This achieves the first best when the tax rate is the same across periods and set at          m . So long
                                                                                             1 t
as m ! 1 , the first-best tax rate is greater than zero, and some government spending is efficient in the first-
best outcome.

                                                      29
government can generate more debt capacity than a long horizon government, simply

because the former does not internalize the cost of repaying the debt, and therefore can

commit to servicing it. Somewhat paradoxically then, the long horizon government may

be unable to undertake valuable ex-ante spending precisely because its concerns about the

ex-post distortions entailed in repaying such spending make lenders distrust it. The ex-

post distortions may, however, be smaller than the ex-ante benefit, in which case short

horizons may be beneficial.

3.3. Endogenous Choice of Vulnerability and Uncertainty

        Thus far, we have taken vulnerability, z, as given. Governments do have some

freedom in choosing z, for instance, pushing it higher by encouraging a repo market in

government assets.

        A good example of quasi-public debt, which is so entangled with the financial

sector’s transactions that it is hard to default on, is the debt of government-sponsored

enterprises (GSE), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in the United States. A significant

portion of the GSE debt is held by the financial sector and by foreign governments who

trade it freely in a highly liquid and sophisticated market – the so-called “agency debt”

market. Agency debt serves the role of collateral for open-market operations (OMO) with

the Federal Reserve – equivalent to the role played by Treasuries, so that any default

would disrupt the transactional services associated with this debt.17 Market participants

reasonably concluded that the special treatment accorded GSE debt as OMO collateral

and the associated centrality of the agency debt market indicated that the United States

17
  Further, default on GSE debt would not only impose collateral damage on the domestic financial sector,
but also raise concerns about implications for repayment on Treasury debt: “They (foreign governments)
wanted to know if the U.S. would stand behind the implicit guarantee – and what this would imply for other
U.S. obligations, such as Treasury bonds.” – Henry Paulson, the United States Treasury Secretary during
Fall 2008, in his account of the crisis, On the Brink, Business Plus, 2010.

                                                   30
government would stand behind this debt in the final eventuality. This implicit guarantee,

in turn, enabled the GSEs to borrow substantially despite being privately held enterprises.

The implicit guarantee was indeed honored by the government when GSEs were placed

in government “conservatorship” in September 2008, without debt holders suffering any

losses.18

           Once z becomes a choice variable, willingness to pay is no longer a constraint on

borrowing. With no uncertainty, the problem simplifies to determining optimal debt when

the only constraint is the ability to pay. Given the optimal date-1 tax rate t1A , the level of

                                    1 t2 f 2 (k1* (t1A ))
z is set such that z t                                    , and date-1 borrowing will be
                                 (1  r ) E0  k1* (t1A )

            1
D1*               t2 f 2 (k1* (t1A )) .
         (1  r )

           Of course, so long as the government does not default at date 2, the cost of default

stemming from z is never incurred. To make the choice of z at date 0 interesting, we

extend the model to allow for uncertainty in date-2 output.

           Specifically, suppose that with probability q , second-period output will be high

at f 2H (k1 ) ! 0 , and otherwise low at f 2L (k1 ) 0, k1 . Hence, the private sector’s problem

                                         1                              1

            Now, whenever debt is to be repaid in the second period, the country will default

in the low state and incur the default costs from disruption of the domestic financial

qD1 ), the government’s problem is

        Greater myopia makes governments care about new borrowing to service old

debt, and hence about making the financial sector vulnerable. Interestingly, with z

endogenous, the optimal date-1 tax increases as the government’s horizon increases. This

is because the expected cost to the government at date 2 – in terms of debt repayments

and deadweight costs of default – exceeds the resources obtained from taxation at that

date. Therefore, the higher the discount factor of the government, E , the less it wants to

borrow. Because the only limit on borrowing is date-2 production, the government lowers

date-2 production by raising the tax rate. It also reduces z to match the lower value of

debt payment that has to be committed to. 19




                                             IV. Implications

Our paper suggests links between government horizons, domestic debt, external debt, and

the health of the financial sector that could be tested. But first, what governments are

myopic and how might one measure it?


19
  In contrast, the effect of uncertainty ( q ) is ambiguous. Note that higher q has the direct effect of
making private sector’s investment more attractive, all else equal, which expands date-2 production and
therefore the borrowing capacity. Thus, on the one hand, a higher tax rate enables the government to
collect more today without as much of a reduction of future taxes which are higher when q increases; on
the other hand, a higher tax rate today reduces corporate investment (which is more productive in an
expected sense as q increases) and thus reduces future tax collection. So we cannot unambiguously sign
the effects of a higher q on the tax rate and debt proceeds. This ambiguity applies both when financial
sector sophistication (z) is exogenous or chosen endogenously by the government.

                                                   33
4.1. Which Governments are Myopic?

        A democracy with a popular leader who has a high expectation of being re-elected

is likely to have longer horizons than a fragile coalition with an unpopular leader. The

longer horizon of the former government might induce it to renegotiate outstanding debt

(a confounding effect, of course, is that the act of renegotiation itself may be popular if a

country is very highly indebted) or take on less new debt.

        One might be tempted to argue that dictatorships have longer horizons and

therefore should be less reliable than democracies in servicing debt – if so, we would

expect to see debt repudiation after coups but not after democratic changes. We would

also expect lower debt capacity for dictatorships. However, many dictatorships are

illegitimate and unstable, and could have shorter horizons than democracies. Without

delving deeper into the nature of the dictatorship, it is hard to be categorical.

        Of course, one way to proxy for the effective horizon of a government is the ratio

of its spending on activities that will pay off in the long term (e.g., infrastructure

investment) to spending that has more immediate and visible benefits (e.g., income

transfers to people). Our model would then suggest that governments that invest more for

the long term would be less inclined to over-borrow, and more inclined to renegotiate

legacy debt.

        Conversely, our model explains why some myopic governments keep current on

their debt, even when most market participants suggest it would be better for them to

default. Indeed, the larger the primary deficit the government needs funded, the greater

the incentive for the government to do what it can to keep lenders happy. For instance, in

Europe, so long as the Euro area and multilateral institutions are willing to provide



                                              34
funding to tide the country over, myopic governments really see no benefit in default, no

matter how much debt accumulates. That does not, however, mean that servicing debt or

taking actions that maintain or expand long term debt capacity (such as creating greater

vulnerability) are in the country’s interest.

        In this vein, our paper suggests a rationale why constitutional limits on

government debt might be useful in countries where governments tend to be myopic.

Alternatively, multilateral agreements (such as the fiscal compact that is being attempted

in Europe today), if enforceable, could be a way for a country to restrain future

governments from borrowing too much.

4.2. Which Governments are Repressive?

        As we have argued, the tax rate could also be interpreted as the extent of financial

repression. Our analysis suggests that poor countries are likely to have more financial

repression (Figure 2a) since they are likely to have little financial savings, and need to

repress the private sector in order to channel more savings into government debt.

Importantly, it is not just that repression channels resources directly to the government

but also that it increases its ability to borrow from foreign investors that makes it so

attractive.

        Our paper suggests that countries at the margin of their capacity to borrow should

see a positive correlation between their domestic bank holdings of government bonds,

and external issuances. The bond holdings of domestic banks give external creditors

comfort.

        This may be one explanation for the large holdings of government bonds by the

banks of a distressed country. Acharya, Drechsler and Schnabl (2010) document that the



                                                35
91 European banks stress-tested in 2010 held sovereign bonds on average up to a sixth of

their risk-weighted assets, and that within these sovereign bond holdings, there is a

“home bias” in that banks held substantial portion in own government bonds. Indeed, the

home bias in sovereign bond holdings was the highest for countries with the greatest risk

of government debt default,20 suggesting they are positively correlated; Countries that are

at greater risk of default also have banks whose portfolios are stuffed with own

government debt.

         One explanation (see Diamond and Rajan (2011)) is that banks have a natural

incentive to load up on risks that will materialize when they themselves are likely to be in

default. But a second, not mutually exclusive, explanation is ours -- that countries have to

prove to new bondholders their enduring resolve to service their foreign debt, and this is

best done by making the costs of default on domestic debt prohibitively costly.

         Of course, for countries that exceed their capacity to borrow without coercion,

coercion of domestic institutions (“financial repression”) is always the last resort. So the

last throes of a government in financial distress, faced with a sudden stop in external

funding, will be to stuff domestic financial institutions with its debt either through

explicit increases in reserve requirements or through mandates. In this case, the positive

correlation between domestic bank holdings of government bonds and external issuances

can break down.

4.3. The Nature of Defaults

         Our model suggests that for countries such as those with an underdeveloped

financial sector and thus low costs of default, the key concern for creditors of the

20
   In particular, in the stress test data released by European regulators in April 2010, banks of Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy held on average more than sixty percent of their government bonds in
own government bonds.

                                                     36
sovereign is the time profile of the country’s debt service burden; They fear that the

country will be required to make net debt repayments for a while that its myopic

government will not honor. This means that countries may face sudden stops of lending if

their expected debt profile goes even a little out of kilter, and the country will not be able

to regain access to loans until its debt is rescheduled – though sometimes a minor

rescheduling (see later) will be enough.

       Multilateral lending institutions like the IMF can help sometimes, not just because

they hold the carrot of additional loans, but because they can press the developing

country government to cut unnecessary spending that will help put the country back on a

sustainable (i.e., net positive debt inflows) debt path.

       For countries with a developed or entangled financial sector, though, the direct

cost of default is substantial, and default looms only when the country simply does not

have the political and economic ability to raise the revenues needed to repay debt – as,

for example, in the case of Greece. Defaults by such countries are more likely to be

solvency defaults (an inability to raise the amounts needed to pay at reasonable political

and social costs rather than an unwillingness to pay) and a simple rescheduling of debt

without significant haircuts to face value is unlikely to help the country regain access to

private markets.

       In our model, the costs of default are sizeable only when the country’s financial

sector is well developed and entangled (when it rarely defaults), but the costs of default

are small otherwise. This may explain some curious aspects of defaults that are less easily

explained by models that have high default costs no matter what the country’s attributes.

Specifically, in models where large penalties are triggered by default, the extent of the



                                              37
default typically should not matter (again see, for example, Eaton and Gersovitz (1981)).

If so, the country might as well repudiate all its debt following the maxim “in for a

penny, in for a pound”. Yet countries rarely do this.21 Developing country debt

renegotiations have ended with debtors agreeing to repay nearly 90 percent of present

value of the outstanding debt (see the case of Uruguay’s 2003 exchange described in

Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2005)).

         The primary objective in developing country debt renegotiations seems to be to

find a mutually acceptable deal that will allow the country to regain access to the debt

markets. Indeed, following a default in our model, a relatively small haircut in the face

value of existing debt (or a rescheduling of maturities) could make the sequence of cash

inflows from the external debt markets positive for each successive government until the

country acquires a sizeable cost of default. The small haircut to existing debt would

therefore be enough to make the debt sustainable. A greater haircut on the debt is not

something the myopic government renegotiating a past default needs, nor is it likely to

want to prolong renegotiation (and its exclusion from external capital markets while thus

engaged), no matter what the future benefit to the country. Given the purpose of

renegotiation is to regain debt market access with positive net inflows, the loss of market

access can indeed be temporary, and debt haircuts very moderate.22

4.4. Debt Profiles

         Our model also suggests a possible explanation for why external debt becomes of

shorter and shorter maturity as a country’s economic difficulties mount. Clearly, lenders

21
  One could, of course, argue that the less that is repaid, the worse the type the country reveals itself to be.
22
  Tough negotiators, like the Argentinian government in the 2003-2005 debt negotiations, which till date
of writing had yet to clear its arrears, are likely to be the exception, probably because their horizons are
longer or because there is domestic political gain (that we do not model) to forcing large haircuts on
unpopular foreign debt holders.

                                                       38
want the ability to refuse to roll over their money if they see fundamental conditions

deteriorating. But the key condition they could be monitoring is not the underlying

country fundamentals but whether others are continuing to lend, giving the country an

incentive to service debt – country liquidity and continuing debt service could be closely

tied. So long as inflows are likely to be positive, the country will continue to service debt,

and short-term lending can be quite lucrative. The key is to stop lending before others are

anticipated to stop, which is why a country’s access can become quite fragile, and prone

to multiple equilibria, as its fundamentals deteriorate and maturities shorten. “Sudden

stops” in lending, and subsequent country default, are the natural consequence (though

their full modeling is beyond the scope of our model).

4.5. Selective Defaults

         We have assumed that the country cannot default selectively on foreign holders of

sovereign debt. All we need, however, is that the sovereign issues tradable claims where

the nationality of the ultimate holder cannot be tracked easily ex ante. Indeed, a sovereign

intent on maximizing borrowing has the incentive to issue such claims. For instance,

default schemes of the following sort do not help avoid default costs – the country

defaults on all its bonds and then pays only bondholders who come with their bonds and

their passport proving nationality. In that case, it would be a simple matter once the

default is declared for the foreigners to sell their bonds to the domestic investors, who

would then collect on them. For similar reasons, a country cannot default on its debt and

then recapitalize only its domestic banks to avoid the dead-weight costs of default –

anticipating the recapitalization, non-bank creditors would simply sell their bonds to the

banks.



                                             39
         Of course, if creditors could be distinguished ex ante, selective defaults are

possible. Consider the recent proposal of the Euro area think tank, Bruegel, for Euro area

sovereigns to issue two kinds of debt, one (blue bond) that is guaranteed by all Euro area

countries and will be held by domestic banks, and another (red bond) that is the

responsibility of the issuing country only and which domestic banks will be prohibited

from holding. Our model points out that there is very little reason for a country to service

the red bonds. These will not be held by key domestic financial institutions, and therefore

will not cause many ripples if they are defaulted on. This will make it hard for a country

to borrow sizeable amounts through red bond issuances, which may indeed be the subtle

intent of the proposal.23




                                       V. Related literature

         There is a vast literature on sovereign debt that we do not have the space to do

justice to (see Eaton and Fernandez (1995) or Tomsz (2007) for excellent discussions).

Our work is most closely related to the recent literature explaining why rich countries

repay because of the costs to the domestic financial sector of sovereign defaults. Our

contribution to this literature is to explain why countries service debt even though the




23
   A somewhat related proposal is in Brunnermeier et al (2011). They suggest that all debt that is eligible
for European Central Bank liquidity operations be managed centrally by a debt management office (and
created as the senior-most tranche of a portfolio of government bonds of all countries). By losing this
liquidity privilege, non-ECB-eligible debt of individual countries would not be readily held by the financial
sector, lowering the countries’ commitment to pay on such debt, and in turn, containing their debt capacity.
An interesting parallel exists in the United States where federal debt (and debt of government-sponsored
enterprises, as explained earlier) is accorded the special status in central bank open-market operations, but
state-level debt is not. Interestingly, the state-level debt in the United States is found not to have much
systemic inter-dependence unlike country-level debt in the Eurozone (Ang and Longstaff, 2011).

                                                     40
current costs of default to them are small. Government myopia plays a key role in the

explanation, as well as in determining fiscal policy and debt capacity.

       Broner, Martin, and Ventura (2010) assume the costs of default on domestic bond

holders and argue that the ability of foreigners who hold domestic bonds to sell out

surreptitiously to domestic entities in the secondary debt markets ensures that the

government will never be able to default selectively on foreigners. Thus the costs of

defaulting on domestically held bonds, combined with liquid and anonymous secondary

markets, ensures the sustainability of foreign borrowing. Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi

(2011) obtain a similar result in a model in which banks demand government bonds as a

store of liquidity. Governments can increase domestic wealth by defaulting on external

creditors, but the disruption of the domestic financial sector reduces this incentive. Thus,

financial development in their setup, which boosts the leverage of banks, increases the

government’s cost of default. They also provide empirical support for the implications of

the model concerning the complementarity of public and private borrowing in good

times, and the severe disruptions to credit and output following sovereign defaults in

countries with financially developed markets. In a similar vein, Andrade and

Chhaochharia (2011) estimate the effect of sovereign default on corporate earnings and

valuation, and find that the cost is greater for financial firms than non-financial firms.

       Bolton and Jeanne (2011) consider a setting in which governments want to

maintain their credit quality so as to keep the inter-bank market working – government

bonds serve a useful collateral role, and banks wish to hold government bonds of

different countries for diversification reasons. While these forces allow the possibility

for governments to borrow ex ante, the financial integration across countries leads ex post



                                             41
to contagion. Since the costs of contagion are not fully internalized by governments of

weaker countries, there may be an inefficient equilibrium supply of government debt.

       Finally, while we have argued that our paper offers an alternative lens to

reputational models such as Tomsz (2007) through which to see sovereign debt, the two

are not mutually exclusive. While we emphasize the short term outlook of governments

and reputational models emphasize the reputational concerns of far-sighted governments,

in reality most governments contain both short-term focused ministers as well as

politicians who look to the long term. Whose influence is maximal, and when, will

determine the kinds of behavior that one might see. More work is needed to nest the

models and derive more detailed implications.


                                  VI. Conclusion

       We have made a number of assumptions in order to make the model more

transparent. For instance, the two period model and the fact that we have investment only

at date 1 allows us to solve for only one tax and one investment. We have also assumed

the emerging market starts out with substantial endowment and legacy debt. A more

general model would be one with no terminal date, and investment every period, and the

country starts out poor with low endowment and low debt in the beginning. In Acharya

and Rajan (2012), we solve such a dynamic model. While the dynamics introduce a

number of interesting effects, the basic results of our simple model still hold. There are a

number of other directions the model can be extended, including introducing a more

direct link between government spending and election outcomes. There is ample scope

for future research.

by taking derivatives of equation (11) with respect to E0 and z, respectively. Q.E.D.

Proposition 1, Corollary 1 and Corollary 2: From Lemma 1, ability-to-pay constraint

applies if tax rate is above t1 and willingness-to-pay constraint applies otherwise.

Further, from Lemma 3, t1W > t1A . Hence, the three cases to consider are: (i) t1W t t1A ! t1 ;

(ii) t1W t t1 t t1A ; and, (iii) t1 ! t1W t t1A .

Under case (i), the feasible region is the ability-to-pay region, so that tax rate is set at the

optimal interior tax rate t1A which from Lemma 2 is independent of E0 and z.

Under case (ii), the feasible region is just the threshold point t1 , which from Lemma 1 is

decreasing in E0 and z.

Under case (iii), the feasible region is the willingness-to-pay region, so that tax rate is set

at the optimal interior tax rate t1W which from Lemma 3 is independent of E0 but

increasing in z.

Whether the equilibrium is in regions (i), (ii) or (iii) is determined by levels of parameters

E0 and z. Consider first the effect of varying E0 . As E0 is raised, the optimal interior tax

rates t1W and t1A corresponding to the willingness-to-pay and ability-to-pay regions,

respectively, are unaffected, whereas the threshold rate t1 declines. It follows then that


                                                    48
there exists threshold levels of E0 (say E0 and E0 ) above and below which respectively

case (i) and (iii) apply. Under case (i), the tax rate is t1A , which is independent of E0 ;

under case (iii), t1W which from Lemma 3 is independent of E0 ; and in between the

thresholds, the tax rate is t1 , which from Lemma 1 is decreasing in E0 .

Consider next the effect of varying z. As z is raised, t1A is unaffected, t1 declines, whereas

t1W rises. It follows then that there exists threshold levels of z (say z and z ) above and

below which respectively case (i) and (iii) apply. Under case (i), the tax rate is t1A , which

is independent of z ; under case (iii), the tax rate is t1W which from Lemma 3 is

increasing in z ; and in between the thresholds, the tax rate is t1 , which is decreasing in

z.

explained above, in the ability-to-pay region (first term inside square brackets), the tax

rate t1* is set to t1A which is independent of E0 (Lemma 2). Then, since
