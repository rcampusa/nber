Political vs. Currency Premia in International Real Interest Differentials:

                A Study of Forward Rates for 24 Countries




                                 ABSTRACT




        Different approaches to quantifying the degree of capital mobility
 for a cross—section of currencies —— particularly saving—investment corre-
 lations and tests of real interest parity — have appeared to show a
 surprisingly low degree of financial market integration. We use a new data
 set, forward rate data for 24 countries, including many small industrial-
 ized countries and seven LDCs, to decompose the real Interest differential
 into two parts: the covered interest differential, or political premium,
 and the real forward discount, or currency premium. The latter In turn can
 be decomposed into the exchange risk premium and expected real
 depreciation.

       We find a high degree of capital mobility across political boun-
daries for most of the G—11 countries, plus Hong Kong and Singapore, for
our sample period of 1982 to 1987. Even for most of the other LDCs and
smaller industrialized countries, for which covered interest parity clearly
fails, the political premium is not as big a component of the real Interest
differential as the currency premium. France would appear to have higher
capital mobility than most by the criterion of real interest differentials,
but is seen in fact to have low capital mobility by the criterion of
covered interest differentials, a clear example of the superiority of the
latter criterion.

1 •    The thallenge to      the View of (hpital as Highly ?bile

       International      capital mobility, at least among most major industri-

alized countries, is conventionally thought to have reached a very high

level by the 1980s. Potentially infinite capital flows are thought to

eliminate differentials among countries' expected rates of return.

       The empirical validity of the conventional view has recently been

challenged from several different directions. First, Feldstein and Horioka

(1980) and Feldstein (1983) reasoned that if capital were indeed perfectly

mobile, then a fall in private saving or in the government budget surplus

in one country should not lead to crowding out of investment; the country

should rather be able to borrow enough funds from abroad at the going world

interest rate to make up the difference. Wit investment rates in fact are

highly correlated with national saving rates, from which Feldstein and

Horioka conclude that capital mobility is not high after all. Numerous

studies have responded to Feldstein and Horioka, most of them econometric

critiques. Wit even when econometric problems, particularly the

endogeneity of national saving, are addressed, the Feldsteln—Horioka

empirical findings seem to hold up.

       The second assault on the conventional wisdom of high capital

mobility comes from tests of real interest parity. Real interest rates

would have to be equalized across countries for exogenous changes in saving

not to crowd out investment, since it is presumably the real interest rate,

rather than nominal, on which saving and investment depend. Real interest

parity can be tested directly, without most of the econometric problems of

the saving—investment regressions. Mishkin (1984a, 1984b), cumby and

                                     —2—



Obstfeld (1984), Mark (1985), cumby and Mishkin (1986), and Gaab, Granziol

and Homer (1986) find that real interest rates are far from perfectly

correlated across countries.

       Many studies test uncovered, or open, interest parity, as a way of

getting at investors' degree of substitutability among countries' bonds.

Almost all of these studies make the rational expectations assumption:

they infer investors' expectations of future exchange rates from the ex

post realizations of the exchange rate in the particular sample period,

arguing that the two differ only by a random expectational error. This

literature, typified by O.xniby and Obstfeld (1984), generally rejects

statistically the hypothesis that the nominal interest differential is an

unbiased estimator of exchange rate changes and interprets these findings

as a rejection of uncovered interest parity. It thus constitutes a third

challenge to the conventional wisdom and offers the exchange risk premium,

in particular, as a prime candidate to explain international inequalities

in expected real rates of return.1

       A fourth challenge to the conventional view that international

capital mobility is high is represented by Dooley and Isard (1986) and

related papers. They argue that there is an historical tendency for

governments of countries that go substantially into debt to foreigners to

renege on that debt through some combination of capital controls, taxation,

or outright default; because investors everywhere are aware of this

tendency, they are increasingly reluctant to lend to a country as its

international indebtedness rises. While this view of political risk is

standard when applied to LDC debtors, Dooley and Isard (1986) apply it to

industrialized countries as well.

2.     The Degree     of   (hpital   !bi1ity   for Different Kinds of (buntries

       The conventional wisdom asserts, not just that (1) the degree of

capital mobility is high, but also that (2) it is higher for most of the

large industrialized countries than for smaller or less developed countires

and (3) it has been rising since the l950s, and particularly since many

countries dismantled their capital controls after 1973 and &iromarkets

began recycling funds on a large scale. These latter two claims have also

been found wanting by the same statistical criteria used to challenge the

first claim.

       On   the   question of the degree of capital mobility among     different
groups of countries, regression studies of national investment rates

against national saving rates for broader cross sections find that the

coefficient is, if anything, higher for OEO countries than for less—

developed countries: Fieleke (1982; 87 countries), Summers (1985; 115

countries), and Dooley, Frankel and Mathieson (1986; 64 countries).2 This

seems to imply a lower degree of capital mobility for OED countries, which

Fieleke (   p.   155), Summers (p. 21), Dooley, Frankel and Mathieson, and most

others consider directly contrary to intuition.

       Table 1 reports instrumental variables regressions of the investment

rate against the national saving rate for three cross—section sub—groups:

industrialized countries, LD classified (by the International Monetary

Fund) as borrowing primarily from commercial sources, and LDCs classified

as borrowing primarily from foreign governments and official agencies. The

most common econometric source of worry In such regressions is the follow-

ing point: governments endogenously respond to incipient current account

imbalances with policies to change public or private saving In such a way

as to reduce the imbalances. This "policy reaction" argument has been made

by Fieleke (1982), Tobin (1983), Westphal (1983), Caprio and Howard (1984)

and Summers (1985). The two instrumental variables used here to deal with

this problem, or with any other source of endogeneity of national saving,

are the ratio of dependents to working—age population, considered a good

Instrument for the private saving rate, and the ratio of military

expenditure to GNP, considered a good instrument for the public sector

(dis—)saving rate.3 tn every case the saving coefficient is significantly

greater than zero, suggesting a degree of crowding out of investment, or ——

in   Feldstein—Horioka's interpretation ——   imperfect   capital mobility. The

coefficient is even higher, indeed is insignificantly different from 1.0,

for the industrialized countries. It is also slightly higher for the

market borrowers than for the official borrowers, again the counter—

intuitive result. Formal tests of the hypothesis that the coefficient for

industrialized countries is different from that for LDCs, and of the

hypothesis that the coefficient for official borrowers is different from

that for market borrowers, fail to reject equality. (Not reported.)

         It should be noted that not everyone's a priori expectations are

that capital mobility should be higher for industrialized countries than

for LDCs, at least by the saving—investment criterion. Indeed, Harberger

(1983, p. 334) criticizes on these grounds Feldstein and Horioka's

conclusion that capital mobility is low for all countries:


          The point to be borne in mind here is that the evidence of
          the Feldstein—Horioka paper was assembled from the 0ED
          countries only. Casting the net wider would have surely
          thrown up indications of much greater divergence between
          saving and investment rates
                                        —6--




        On the question of the evolution over time of the degree of capital

mobility, there is no evidence that the coefficient in regressions of

investment on saving rates has fallen over time. This finding emerges both

from cross—section studies, which often report pre— and post—1973 results

——   Feldstein   (1983), Penati and Dooley (1984), and Dooley, Frankel and

Mathieson (1986) —— and from pure time series studies ——     Obstfeld
(l986a,b)5 and Frankel (1986) for the United States. In Table 1 the

estimated coefficient actually increases after 1973, for each of the three

sets of countries. Similar results hold for tests of interest parity.

Mishkin (1984, P. 1352), for example, found even more significant

rejections of real interest parity among major industrialized countries for

the floating rate period after 1973/TI than he did for his entire 1967/11-

1979111 sample period. Caramazza et al (1986, pp. 43—47) also found that

some of the major industrialized countries in the 1980s (1980.1—1985.6)

moved farther from real interest parity than they had been in the 1970s

(1973 .7—1979 .12)




3.     Decoaposition Using Forward Rate Data

        Given    the disparity between the results reported above and a priori

expectations ——      not just that capital mobility is high, but also that it is
higher for open industrialized countries than for LDCS and that it has

increased over time — one must wonder whether tests based on saving—

investment correlations or on real interest differentials are giving us the

right answer. This paper breaks up the real interest differential into its

components in order to shed light on these questions. The real interest

differential is defined as
                                                  —7—



           r —   r    = (1 —            — (1* —                               (1)

where r is the real interest rate, i is the nominal interest rate,

it   is the expected Inflation rate and asterisks represent foreign

variables. Our        decomposition         is



           r —   r*   =   (i   —   i*   —   fd) + (fd e) + (e —   it + ir*)   (2)


where fd is the forward discount and ASe is the expected rate of

depreciation of the domestic currency.

        The first term is the covered interest differential. The interest

rates I and j* refer to local rates in the two countries. We claim

that the international covered interest differential is the appropriate

measure of the degree of capital mobility, in the sense of the degree of

integration of financial markets across political boundaries. In the

absence of substantial transactions costs, information costs, capital

controls, risk of future capital controls and default risk, the mean and

variability of the covered interest differential should be small. We

follow the tradition of Aliber (1973) in calling this differential the

"political" premium, though "country" premium would be just as good.

        We view it as no longer interesting to test covered interest parity

with interest rates observed in the same Eurocurrency market as the forward

discount, other than as a test for errors In the data. This condition has

already been well—established.6 Rather than artificially setting up a

hypothesis of market efficiency to be tested statistically, we believe that

the interesting question is to quantify the size of the covered interest

differentials and thereby the barriers to international capital mobility.

We take It for granted that these barriers are essentially zero within the
                                    —8—



London eurocurrency market. One would anticipate that some   countries
within our sample have by the 1980s become so open and efficient finan—

daily as to constitute part of the world eurocurrency market; but this is

something that should emerge from our calculations.

       The other two terms have to do with the currency in question rather

than the political jurisdiction per se. They may be called the exchange

risk premium and expected real depreciation, respectively. Given the clear

empirical failure of purchasing power parity, there is no reason why the

last term should necessarily be zero. A non—zero expected rate of real

depreciation would in itself open up a real interest differential even if

the political and exchange risk premiums were zero. Thus real interest

parity could be invalidated by imperfect integration of goods markets rather

than imperfect integration of financial markets .7 Nevertheless several

authors, while recognizing the point in theory, continue to identify real

interest differentials with some combination of political premiums and

exchange risk premiums.

         "The incomplete linkage of real interest rates inter-
         nationally appears to reflect risk premiums which vary with
         the size of a nation's foreign borrowing."

                                                Darby (1986, p. 420)
        "There are two major reasons why expected real interest rate
        may fail to be equal across countries ... In a world with
        risk—averse investors, differences in risk will lead to
        differences in expected returns ... A differential in
        expected real returns across countries may also be due to
        market segmentation or barriers to capital movements across
         currencies ."
                                             Koraczyk (1985, p. 350)

       This paper uses forward market data to decompose the real interest

differential into its three components. Many tests of covered interest
                                    —9—



parity already exist. &it none to our knowledge goes beyond a small sample

of a few countries. We use forward rate series quoted by Barclay's Bank in

London (and reported by DRI) for 24 countries between September 1982 and

March 1987. The sample includes small as well as large countries, coun-

tries with as well as without capital controls, and less developed as well

as industrialized countries. En using covered interest differentials as

the test of financial market integration versus segmentation for a

(relatively) large cross—section of countries, we can see how well this

criterion of capital mobility corresponds to the real interest differential

and other criteria that have been proposed.

       To state our findings in advance, the largest industrialized

countries, and a few others that are known to have an absence of capital

controls, by our criterion of covered interest parity show (unsurprisingly)

a higher degree of financial market integration than do other countries.

The deviations from real interest parity are generally much greater than

the deviations from covered interest parity, suggesting that currency

factors, due to exchange rate variability, are a larger source of the

failure of real interest parity in the 1980s than are barriers to the flow

of capital across political jurisdictions. There is no reason to doubt the

correctness of conclusions, drawn from the Feldstein—Horioka tests or real

interest parity tests, regarding the "crowding out" effects of changes in

national saving. Bat these tests are not the correct criteria for

measuring the degree of international capital mobility in the sense of the

degree of integration of financial markets across countries.

4.    Deviations from a1 Interest Parity


       Table 2a reports statistics on three—month real interest differen-

tials for our 24 countries, in each case the local interest rate measured

relative to the Eurodollar interest rate. For local interest rates we use

the interbank rate or, where no market rate exists, the most flexibly—

determined interest rate available. (See data appendix for details.) We

begin by using simply the realized inflation rates during the ex post

three—month period, on the assumption that cx ante expected inflation rates

cannot be very far off over such a short term. (We will be using ex ante

inflation forecasts below.)

       Column (1) reports the mean real interest differential during the

sample period, 1982 to 1987. The numbers are negative for a majority of

countries, averaging —1.79 percent across all 24, which reflects the high

level of real dollar interest rates during this sample period. The mean is

statistically significant for most groups of countries.

       The countries are classified into five groups chosen on a priori

grounds. The group with real interest rates the farthest below the world

rate is Mexico, South Africa, Greece and Bahrain. These four (very

diverse) countries bear the burden of representing a wide class of LDCs in

our sample. There are seven countries classified as LDCs that happen to

have forward rate data available, and thereby appear in our sample; three

East Asian LDGs that are known to have liberalized financial markets (Hong

Kong, Singapore and Malaysia) are classified separately. One might object

that the large negative real interest differentials in the group of four

reflect administered local interest rates that are kept artificially low by

"financial repression." &tt   countries   cannot maintain artifically low

correlations because countries in both groups, six of the total sevens fall

into the "market borrower" classification used in the preceding section.

(only Bahrain is classified as an official borrower.)

       The result in Table 2 that real interest differentials are more

variable for LDCS than for industrialized countries suggests that the

saving—investment correlations are not picking up the degree of equali-

zation of real rates of return. One possibility is that sensitivity of

physical investment to the real rate of interest in domestic financial

markets varies across countries. Let the investment rate be given by


          (I/Y).=a—br.+c.                                                 (3)


Presumably b, the sensitivity of physical investment to the real interest

rate, would be higher in OED countries than in LDCs; in the latter, more

investment is financed out of retained earnings, family wealth or

government credit than by issuing debt or equity in the marketplace. Then

the covariance of investment and saving rates can be written


          Cov(I/Y, NS/Y) =   —b   Cov(r_r*, NS/Y) 4 b Cov(r*, NS/Y)

                                  + 0v(c, NS/Y)                           (4)


If the "large—country" and other endogeneity problems have been solved,

i.e., r* and c can both be assumed uncorrelated with the saving rate

(NS/Y) so that the last two terms drop out, then


          Cov(I/Y, NS/Y) = —b Cov(r_r*, NS/Y) .                           (5)

We can now see how even if two countries have the same Cov(r_r*, NS/Y),

interest rates without barriers to capital outflow: these statistics

reflect a low degree of capital mobility precisely as we want them to. In

this respect our group of four is typical. A number of studies, including

much larger LDC samples than available here, have shown the extremes to

which LDC real interest rates can go, particularly some very negative

levels in the 1970s 8

        As with the other measures of interest rate differentials that we

will be considering below, the mean is not always the most useful

statistic. A small mean over a particular sample period may hide fluc-

tuations of the differential in both directions. Even if a mean is statis-

tically significant,9 it is useful to know in addition the variability of

the differential. The standard deviation is reported in column (2). We

also report the root mean squared error (ENSE) in column (3); this would be

a superior measure of how closely the rates are tied together if, for

example, we are worried about the possibility of a large differential that

is fairly constant over time because of government administration of

interest rates. Finally we report in column (4) how big a band would have

to be to encompass 95 percent of the deviations from real interest parity.

        Country—group comparisons of the measures of real interest differ—

than do the saving—Investment correlations reported in the preceding

section. The industrialized countries generally have less variable real

interest differentials than the LDCs. New Zealand is the main exception,

with a high variability. Within the group of seven LDGs, the three open

Asian countries come closer to real interest parity than the four closed

countries •   it   this comparison sheds little light on the saving—investment

might expect the coefficient on the nominal interest differential to be

close to 1.0 and that on the lagged inflation rate close to —1.0. But for

many individual countries the coefficients are not even of the right

sign.1' When coefficients are constrained to be the same across countries

within groups, they are much more sensible.

       Column (8) reports the standard deviation of our projected real

interest differential. The variation of the projected real interest

differential in column (8) is less than that of the ex post real interest

differential in column (2) confirming that a part of the movement in infla-

tion rates was not forecastable. But the results are nevertheless similar

to those in Table 2a. Again, the group of four closed LDcs is the group

with the most variable real interest differentials, though Spain and New

Zealand are also quite high. Singapore has the least variable ex ante real

interest differential, followed by Canada, Germany, Japan and Norway.



5.    The POlitical Factors, 1presented by the Q)vered Interest
      Differential


       We now use the Barclay's forward rate data to decompose the real

interest differential into one part due to political factors and another

due to currency factors:


          r_r*=(i_i*_fd)+(fd_+*) •                                         (6)

The first component, the covered interest differential, encompasses all

factors related to the political jurisdiction in which the asset is

issued. This includes both existing capital controls and the risk of

future capital controls, as well as transfer risk, default risk, etc. The

second component, which might be called the "real forward discount,"
                                   —13---




investment in the OED country might suffer more crowding out, because of a

higher "b", than investment in the LDC.

       The measures of real interest differential variability show some

results that are anomalous if they are taken to be tests of financial

market integration. For example France, which had stringent capital

controls at least during the early part of our sample period, appears to

have a higher degree of capital mobility by the criterion of real interest

differential variability than Japan, which announced liberalization of its

capital controls before our sample period (1979—80). One might conceivably

argue that the Japanese liberalization must not have been genuine.10

the French real interest differential is smaller and less variable even

than those of the Netherlands and Switzerland (and, by the RMSE statistic,

Germany and the United Kingdom as well), major industrialized countries

that are known to be virtually free of capital controls. Only nada, of

all 24 countries, shows a smaller and less variable real interest differ-

ential, by all measures, than France.

       It can be objected that the real interest rate measures reported

above are invalid because they use ex post inflation rates, which investors

could not have known at the beginning of each three—month period. Table 2b

reports the results of projecting ex post inflation rates on a constant

term and three relevant variables known to investors: the lagged inflation

differential (over the preceding year), the three—month interest differen-

tial (the same one appearing in the real interest differential itself), and

the three—month forward discount (which is examined more fully below).

Qñumns (5), (6) and (7) report the estimated coefficients on these three

variables. In forecasting the ex post real interest differential, one

encompasses factors related to the currency of denomination of the asset.

It consists, in particular, of the exchange risk premium plus expected real

depreciation, as we have seen. These factors are distinct from the

question of international capital mobility narrowly defined.

       Column (1) of Table 3 reports the mean of the covered interest

differential for each of our 24 countries.12 A good rule of thumb, when

the absolute magnitude of the mean or the variability of the differential

indicates the existence of significant barriers, is: a negative differen-

tial vis—a—vis the Eurocurrency market indicates that, to the extent

barriers exist, they are capital controls or transactions costs currently

operating to discourage capital from flowing out of the country. Investors

would not settle for a lower return domestically if they were free to earn

abroad the higher return covered to eliminate exchange risk. This is the

case for all of the LDCs in the sample, with the exception of Hong Kong,

and for all of the small European countries •   The negative differential

that existed for the United Kingdom before Margaret Thatcher removed

capital controls in 1979 is now extremely small.'3 Similarly, Canada's

differential is effectively zero (as shown, e.g., by Hootheetal, 1985,

p. 112). Column (4), the size of the band wide enough to encompass 95

percent of deviations from international covered interest parity, can be

compared with the approach of Frenkel and Levich (1977). They tested a

larger band meant to represent transactions costs between pound and dollar

securities (1.0 percent for the spot and forward transactions alone, July

1973 — May 1975, p. 1215). They found, for the case of the United Kingdom,

that a smaller percentage of deviations (87.6 — 89.7 percent, p. 1217) fell

within the band; this confirms again that capital mobility has increased

since the 1970s.

       Germany is one of the few cases showing a higher interest rate

locally than offshore, which suggests some barriers discouraging capital

inf low: investors would not settle for a lower mark return in the Euro—

market if they were free to get the higher return in Germany.     But the   mag-

nitude is small, as it has been observed to be ever since Germany removed

most of its controls on capital inflow in 1974 (Dooley and Isard, 1980; and

Giavazzi and Pagano, 1985, p. 27). By either the criteria of the mean or

of the variability measures reported in the next two columns, there is also

high capital mobility for Switzerland and, especially, the Netherlands, two

other &iropean countries that are widely thought to have open financial

markets.

       Japan has a covered differential that by all measures Is smaller

than Switzerland and Germany, let alone France and the smaller European

countries. This might come as a surprise to those accustomed to thinking

of Japanese financial markets in terms of the large barriers to capital

inf low that were in place In the l970s. The liberalization of Japanese

markets, which has been documented elsewhere, continued during our sample

period.14 1though foreign residents have been free to hold many Japanese

assets since 1979, such as the three—month Gensaki upon which most tests of

covered interest parity (including ours) are based, calculations using the

Interest rate on Japanese certificates of deposit (not reported) show that

liberalization In this market did not occur until April 1985.

       The covered interest differential for France is much larger and more

variable than that for the other major Industrialized countries known to be

free of capital controls. In the cases of Switzerland and the Netherlands

in particular, this is the reverse of the finding from the criterion of

real interest differential in Table 1 •   It   supports the value of the cr1—

tenon of covered interest differentials as the proper test of financial

market integration. The differential, with its negative sign signifying

controls on French capital outflows, has been previously studied,

especially its tendency to shoot up shortly before devaluations of the

franc.15 Rit   our   data indicates that the last major occurrence of this

phenomenon was February 1986; since then the differential has been close to

zero. Similarly, the same phenomenon that has been observed for Italy

(e.g., Giavazzi and Pagano, 1985) appears to have ended after the March 22

1983 EMS realignment. Indeed the differential, which was zero by the time

Giavazzi and Pagano's sample period ended in late 1984, turned suddenly

positive in 1985. One possible explanation is that beginning in 1985

investor preferences shifted toward holding lira assets, and that existing

controls prevented sufficient inflow to equalize lira interest rates •       &it
a contrary possibility must be noted: in situations when —— on the basis

of either large domestic or international indebtedness, political

instability or a past history of controls on outflow —— one might a priori

expect the local environment to be risky (i.e., riskier than the Eurodollar

market), an observed positive differential might not be attributable to

existing controls on inflow. In such circumstances a positive differential

might be attributable rather to the risk of future controls on outflow, or

of default or other penalty. The higher interest rate onshore than

offshore is then the compensation necessary to induce investors voluntarily

to hold risky local assets. This sort of default risk premium is more

familiar in the context of long—term bonds and loans than with the three—

month deposits studied here, but there is no reason why it could not

apply.16 A similar ambiguity pertains to Belgium as to Italy; the mean of

the differential is positive, but its lack of statistical significance
                                      —18--




suggests that it might be an equilibrium rate of return (we are using the

Belgian financial franc exchange rate rather than the commercial franc

rate) and not a sign of barriers (even small ones) to capital inf low as in

Germany.

          Registering impressively open markets are our three East Asian

LDCs. Hong Kong and Singapore show smaller covered interest differentials

even than some open industrialized countries like Germany and Switzer-

land. Malaysia's differential is considerably higher, but still compares

favorably with most European countries.'7 Similarly, Australia and New

Zealand, both of which have begun to liberalize their financial markets,

lie in the middle ground. In the case of Australia there is evidence of

the liberalization within the sample period: the frequently large negative

covered differential that had been observed up to mid 198318 largely

vanished thereafter.

         Not surprisingly, our remaining LDCs, Mexico, Greece, Bahrain and

South Africa, show by far the largest and most variable covered interest

differentials. (Bahrain19 shows a smaller differential than the others,

and even than some of the European countries with controls, like Denmark,

Norway and Spain.) Again, the results are precisely what one would expect

if covered interest differentials are the proper criterion for capital

mobility, but precisely the reverse of what the saving—investment criterion

shows.

tistics    using ex post inflation rates, the last column reports the varia-

bility of the ex ante real forward discount, with the inflation rates pro-

jected on the same three variables as in Table 2b.2° It is clear why some

of the countries that have highly open capital markets by the covered inte-

rest parity definition —       i.e.,   no barriers to the flow of capital across

political boundaries per se ——         nevertheless exhibit significant deviations
from real interest parity. The currency premium is the difference.

          Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland, for example, all

have substantial real forward discounts, fd —          (it — ¶*), which   constitute

approximately the entirety of their real interest differentials,

I — 1* — ('it — .it*) •21   These are countries with currencies that have experi-

enced a lot of exchange rate variability, both nominal and real, vis—a—vis

the dollar since 1973, and especially since 1980.22 As a consequence, some

combination of exchange risk premiums and expected real depreciation ——

factors   pertaining to the currency, not to political jurisdiction ——

produces the gap in real interest rates •         For these four financially—open

Industrialized countries, and f or Hong Kong as well, the currency factors

produce a negative real differential even though the covered interest

differential is positive:        the small controls or frictions that remain

are, if anything, working to resist capital inflow into these countries,

not outflow as one would mistakenly conclude from the real interest

differential criterion. The other countries all have highly variable

currency premiums as well. Indeed, the real forward discount (currency

premium) is more variable than the covered interest differential (political

premium) for all but five of our countries (France, Greece, Italy, Mexico

and Norway). The last row of Thbles 4a and 2a shows that the average
                                                     —20—



variability across all 24 countries is higher for the real forward discount

than for the covered interest differential.

             Thus many of our countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom and

Germany, apparently can borrow abroad if they wish to, without having to

pay a substantial country risk premium, contrary to the Darby sentence

quoted in section 3. The only qualifications are that (1) they might have

to issue the debt in foreign currency to be sure of paying no exchange risk

premium, fd —           5e,     and (2) the borrowing may force the real interest rate

above world levels nevertheless, if it is associated with expected future

real depreciation of the currency,

            Peal Depreciation

             Our decomposition       so far has lumped two terms, the exchange risk
premium and expected real depreciation, together into the currency premium:

               fd   —   ¶+    ¶* =   (fd   —
                                               e) + (e —       ir+   ff*)




En this section we attempt to complete the decomposition by separating

these two terms •            To do so requires a measure or model of expected

depreciation As. The usual approach is to use the ex post changes in the

spot rate                 and argue that under rational expectations the

expectational error                        ts,÷1 —          should be random (uncorrelated

with information currently available at time t).

             Column (1) of Ible 5a reports the mean value of fd —                 ts         for
                                                                              t        t÷1

 tunate enough to use data from the early l980s alone would show almost all

 currencies paying negative exchange risk premiums vis—a—vis the dollar, to

 a degree that appeared statistically significant even on a few years of

 data. This is just another way of saying that until 1985 the dollar

 systematically appreciated against other currencies to an extent not

 forecast by their forward rates. it our sample now includes data through

1987, including two years of dollar depreciation against the other major

currencies. Most of the means are positive, showing that the strong dollar

period dominates. (The exceptions, currencies that depreciated at a more

rapid rate against the dollar than the forward discount, were the Canadian

dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, Saudi Arabian riyal, South

African rand, and Australian dollar.) &tt the Saudi riyal is the only one

that shows a statistically significant mean risk premium of either

sign.22 Furthermore the sign is usually the opposite of the sign of the

mean real interest differential during the same period (Table 2a, column

(1)), i.e., this measure of the mean return differential does not explain

any positive part of the mean real interest differential.

       The measures of variability of   fd —       ,   which show up very
large in columns (2), (3) and (4), are measures of the variability of ex

post return differentials, not ex ante. They tell us little about the

variability of the exchange risk premium. &it the second moments do tell

us two things. flrst, they provide an obvious explanation ——   low   power ——

why the first moments might not be statistically significant. The
                                                                  magni-
tude of the error term is widely agreed to be much larger than the magni-

tude of the error term in forecasting inflation, or than the magnitude of

the forward discount or exchange risk premium, making it more difficult in

general to identify statistically significant elements of fd —

Mishkin (1984b, 1353—54) notes how, even though the real interest differ-
ential is highly significant statistically, the high variance of s makes

it difficult to separate out the exchange risk premium in a statistically

significant way. On the other hand, the existence of large uncertainty

regarding the future spot rate suggests, via the theory of optimal

portfolio diversification, that a non—zero exchange risk premium must

exist, to reward risk—averse investors for holding currencies that are

perceived as risky or that are in oversupply.23

       lb estimate ex ante returns, in Table 5b we project fd —

onto the forward discount, the interest differential, and the one—year

lagged inflation rate, the same variables as in the earlier regressions.

Monetary models of exchange rate determination give us reasons why any one

of these three variables, when considered alone, might be a useful predic-

tor of changes in the spot rate. The general principle of efficient

foreign exchange markets, jointly with the absence of an exchange risk pre-

mium, would imply that no predictable component of spot rate changes should

remain beyond the forward discount. &it many previous studies of bias in

the forward rate have found statistically significant results by condi-

tioning on the forward discount itself. The null hypothesis of unbiased—

ness is a zero coefficient on the forward discount, but most studies find a

coefficient closer to one, which would indicate that the spot rate follows

a random walk (the rationally expected rate of depreciation is zero), and

all of the forward discount is an exchange risk premium. Some studies even

get a coefficient greater than one.

       The regressions appear statistically significant by an F test at the

95 percent level for 12 of the 24 countries (though it is usually not a

 positive coefficient on the forward discount that gives the explanatory

 power). This constitutes a rejection of the hypothesis of perfect

 substitutability (no exchange risk premium), jointly with the rational

expectations assuniption.24 We proceed for the moment on the usual

assumption that the systematic prediction errors should be interpreted as

the exchange risk premium rather than as systematic expectational errors.

All the countries that are statistically significant are industrialized

countrIes, confIrming the importance of floating exchange rates for

exchange risk. In Table 5c we pool observations from the cross section of

currencies within each of the five country groups. We use Seemingly

Unrelated Regressions to take proper account of the correlation in the

error term across currencies. (When, for example, the dollar/Belgian franc

rate increases, the dollar/Danish kroner rate often increases at the same

time.) We can now reject the joint hypothesis for one additional currency,

the Hong Kong dollar, and for all but one of the aggregated country groups.

       The standard deviation of the projected exchange risk premium is

reported in column (8). It is large, indeed much larger than the standard

deviation of the total real interest differential, whether the projections

are done country—by—country, in Table 5b, or simultaneously, in Table 5c.

       In Table 6 we report the statistics for the other component of the

currency premium, expected real depreciation. Given the now widely—

accepted failure of purchasing power parity on levels, there is no theoret-

ical reason to expect it necessarily to hold in terms of expected rates of

change, a hypothesis sometimes known as ex ante relative purchasing power

parity. Nevertheless many previous studies have been unable to reject

statistically the hypothesis that the real exchange rate follows a random
                                     —24—



walk, which in turn implies, if expectations are rational, that expected

real depreciation is zero. Table 6a reports the statistics for uncon-

ditional real depreciation. The means in column (1) are negative,

indicating real appreciation of the currency against the dollar, for all of

the developed countries on the European continent, regardless of financial

openness, and for Japan and New Zealand. The LDcs, plus nada, the United

Kingdom and Australia, all depreciated in real teruis during our 1982—87

sample period. Nost are not statistically significant. &it the signs are

usually the same as the signs of the mean real interest differentials,

suggesting a high correlation of the real interest differential and ex-

pected real depreciation across countries. Columns (2)—(4) show very high

variability in real depreciation, but again this tells us little about the

variation of ex ante expected depreciation, beyond the observation that the

high level of variability implies low power in our tests of ex ante

relative purchasing power parity.

       Table 6b reports the results from conditioning real depreciation on

our same three variables •   Note that if the nominal exchange rate follows a

random walk then the real exchange rate cannot follow a random walk, to the

extent that inflation differentials are forecastable. (Of course one can

fail statistically to reject both random walk hypotheses due to low power.

Indeed this sort of failure is very common.) The regressions appear

statistically significant at the 95 percent level in only 8 cases out of

24. The significant countries are all Industrialized countries that also

showed significant exchange risk premiums: Austria, Canada, Denmark,

Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

       The specific regression results, if not the finding of some

significant countries, may be sensitive to the sample period. The standard
                                     —26—



believe that these figures represent the expectations that investors held?

       An alternative approach is offered by survey data on the exchange

rate expectations of market participants. Three such surveys have been

conducted in the 1980s, by American Express, the Economist, and Money

Market Services, Inc. The data are analyzed in Frankel and Froot (1985,

1986) and Froot and Frankel (1986) •28 They show that respondents at

horizons of 6 and 12 months expect the dollar to regress to PPP (using the

1973—80 average real exchange rate as the base), to a highly significant

degree statistically. Table 7 reports results from the Economist data at

the six—month horizon. To obtain enough observations, the five exchange

rates against the dollar are pooled (mark, yen, pound, French franc and

Swiss franc) .   Rows (1)—(4) show a highly significant expected nominal

depreciation in response to gaps from PPP, whether or not we correct for

first—order autoregression in the residuals. The expected speed of

regression is estimated at .061 to .165 per six—months, or 12—33 percent

per annum. This is roughly in the same range as the actual speed of

regression to PPP estimated on 116 years of real exchange rate data. Row

(5) shows expected real depreciation in response to PPP gaps that is also

significant statistically, (though the other Economist six—month data set

reported in row (6), from alternate non—overlapping survey dates, is not

significant). According to the survey data the expected real depreciation

of the dollar in the early 1980s was large enough to explain the entire

differential in real interest rates between the United States and its

trading partners. This conclusion is consistent with that of the preceding

sections, that the large and variable real interest differentials that are

still observed among the larger industrialized countries in the 1980s are
                                    —25—



deviation of the projected real depreciation (column (8) in table 6 b) is

large; as with the projected exchange risk premium, the variability is

greater than the variability in the real interest differential.

       As noted, many previous studies have failed to reject a random—walk

real exchange rate.25 It has been suggested that this failure reflects the

low power of tests based on the short data set available from the floating

rate period (fifteen years of data) •26 Frankel (1986) uses 116 years of

U.S.—U.K. time series data, and finds a statistically significant tendency

of the real exchange rate to regress to purchasing power parity at a rate

of 15—30 percent a year. Table 6c musters more data to attack the problem

along another dimension, by pooling across countries. Pooling allows a

rejection of the null hypothesis in most cases. The significance levels

are highest for European countries and remain low for most of the LDCs,

suggesting that exchange rate variability makes expected real depreciation

an important contributor to real interest differentials for countries on

floating exchange rates in particular. This finding supports the claim of

McKinnon (1987) that the variability of real exchange rates under the

floating—rate regime leads to variability in real interest differentials.

} concludes that a more stable exchange rate regime would be more

efficient economically.

       One possibility is that the entire approach of trying to infer

expectations from ex post exchange rate changes has been overdone. From

1981 to 1984 the rate of return on dollar assets was 12 to 18 percent

higher than on other major currencies, because the interest differential

favored the dollar and yet the dollar persistently appreciated rather than

depreciated. The difference was statistically significant.27 Do we really
                                       —27--




not in most cases due to imperfect integration of financial markets across

national boundaries.



8.    Qrnclusions Regarding    Alternative Measures   of (hpital Mobility

       Measures of capital mobility that are based on rates of return are

superior to saving—Investment correlations in that they require no assump-

tion about the exogeneity of national saving or of chosen instrumental

variables, nor about other parameters such as the sensitivity of investment

to the real interest rate. &t we saw in section 4 that the real interest

differential criterion gives some of the same counterintuitive results as

the saving—investment test: it appears to show that, even in the 1980s and

even among industrialized countries, capital mobility remains low.

       We conclude the paper by seeing what role each of the components of

the real interest differential has in explaining the variance of the

total. Qiart 1 plots the standard deviation of the real interest differ-

ential against the standard deviation of the covered interest differential,

which we have identified as the political premium. While the political

premium does have some explanatory power, the fit is not extremely close

(R2 = .48)   and would be even weaker if one were to exclude Mexico, where

political risk has increased drastically since August 1982 due to the

international debt crisis.

       Chart 2 puts the real forward discount, which we have identified as

the currency premium, on the horizontal axis. Here the relationship is

stronger (a2   = .76) •29   (The only country that is an outlier is South

Africa, another case where it is plausible that political factors should

outweigh currency factors.) The currency premium appears to be a more

Separate dummy variables were estimated for each currency. All estimates of constant terms and dummy
variables are omitted to save space. ait they, and dates of sample observations, are reported in the
earlier working papers. R2 corresponds to an F test on all non—intercept parameters. DW statistic
is the average of the equation—by—equation OLS Durbin—Watson statistic for each of the five currencies.

of integration, especially for Canada, Germany, the Netherlands,

Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Japan, Hong Kong and

Singapore. For these countries, currency factors, not political factors,

explain virtually the entire real interest differential. In this line, it

is highly suggestive that real interest differentials appear to have become

more variable after 1973 despite the reduction in political barriers. It

is possible that the increase in the saving—investment coefficient after

1973, evident in Table 1 and in earlier studies, is due to this increase in

real interest differential variability, which may in turn be due to the

change in exchange rate regime as McKinnon (1987) claims.

       Even for most of the countries that show significant political

premiums, the currency factors dominate. Of the two currency factors,

expected real depreciation is as large and variable as the exchange risk

preuiiuni and appears to be the more important determinant of the real

interest differential. To this extent, imperfect integration of goods

markets, rather than imperfect integration of financial markets, may be

responsible for the failure of real interest rates to be equalized. &it

this is no reason to change the conclusion that a shortfall of national

saving can drive the real interest rate above foreign levels and thereby

crowd out investment in the same country.

important determinant of the real interest differential than is the

political premium, even though it is the latter variable that measures

financial integration across national boundaries.

       The remaining question is whether the explanatory power of the real

forward discount comes from the exchange risk premium or expected real

depreciation. Qiarts 3 and 4 show the measures based on variability of

these two (ex ante) differentials, respectively. The question of this

decomposition is harder to answer because of the unobservability of

exchange rate expectations. t the evidence seems to suggest that

expected real depreciation is somewhat more closely related to the real

forward discount, and in turn to the real interest differential, than is

the exchange risk premium. This is particularly true for the first moments

shown in tharts 7 and 8: there is, if anything, a negative relationship

between the mean exchange risk premium and the mean real interest

differential (both ex post) across countries. &it the standard deviations

also show a stronger fit for projected real depreciation (R2 = .35)       than

for the projected exchange risk premium CR2 =     .03).   Our findings consti-

tute a rejection of the identification by Korajczyk (1985) of the exchange

risk premium with the real interest differential; this has also been

pointed out by thngworth (1986, p. 16), who reports findings on the

importance of expected real depreciation similar to ours.

       To repeat our conclusions, the covered interest differential is a

better measure of capital mobility —   in   the sense of the degree of

financial market integration across national boundaries ——    not only than
saving—investment correlations, but also than real interest differentials.

The covered interest differential criterion shows a generally high degree

                           DATA APPENDIX



1. Forward and Spot Exchange Rates
      Spot and three month forward exchange rates for 23
countries are collected by Barclay's Bank and stored on DRIFACS

daily for the period September, 1982 to the present. Exchange
rates for the 24th country in our sample, Belgium, were also
stored on DRIFACS, but were compiled by the Bank of America. In
the cases of South Africa and Belgium which have dual exchange
rate systems, the forward and spot rates are for the financial
Rand and Franc. We used the last observation for each month

from September, 1982 through March, 1987, yielding a total
possible sample of 5 data points. Data were available for all
countries during the entire period except for Mexico; forward
rate data have not been reported for Mexico since March, l98.
All exchange rates are against the dollar.
      The forward discount is calculated as four times the log
difference in contemporaneous forward and spot exchange ratts.

Exchange depreciation over the period is formed similarly,
substituting the realized spot rate three months later for the
forward rate.



2. Interest Rates
      Interest rates were chosen to match as closely as possible
the   three—month term of the forward exchange rates and the
market—determined characteristics of the eurodollar   deposit   rate
to which they are compared. The cleanest measure of a covered

September, 1982.
     For this paper e use interest differentials, calculated as
ln(1+i) —   ln(1+i*),    where i refers to the local interest rate
and i to the eurodollar rate.


3. inflation Rates
     All inflation rates are calculated from the consumer price
indices as published by the IMF in International Financial
Statistics. In all cases but four the indices are available
monthly; for Australia, Bahrain, Ireland and Ne Zealand
quarterly data were interpolated to form monthly series.
Inflation rate differentials (local vs. U.S. inflation) over the
life of the three month contracts are calculated as

L+Eln(1+u.) —ln(1+r.+.)J where ir., and            1T.+.,*   refer   to local and
U.S. three month inflation rates, calculated with:
                            =   ln(P.b.+.,) — ln(P,)
The one year lagged inflation differential used in projecting
exchange and inflation rates are calculated in a similar manner:
                        1fl(1+T._-1r — ln(1-4-ir
interest differential comes from exchange rates and interest
rates observed at the same instant. This is not possible for
such a large sample of countries, but for most of the countries
interest rates are observed on the same day, or very close to
it. A table of the rates, their sources and definitions appears
below. The sources are: WFM —— World Financial Markets,
published by Morgan Guaranty Bank, DRI —— Data Resources'
DRIFACS databank, and IFS ——   International   Financial Statistics.

Interest rates are quoted on an annual basis and are mostly
available for all countries during the entire period. For the
case of Malaysia data begin in September, 1983, rather than

       "We here depart from the usual practice of not reporting the
coefficients in the projection and thus sweeping under the rug the question
of their sensibility. The usual argument is that as long as the variables
are predetermined, the projection will be reliable asymptotically. Mishkin
(l984a,b), for example, projects the real interest rate on i, lagged money
growth, lagged inflation, time, time2, time   and time4. It is easy to
forget that instrumental variables will only give good answers if they are,
not only exogenous, but also correlated with the righthand—side variable.

       '2The last 29 observations for Italy, and a few observations for
Austria, show forward rates that are very close to the contemporaneous spot
rates, giving forward discounts that are close to zero. While Barclay's
purports to trade at these rates, they seem suspect. The reader may want
to disregard the numbers for Italy and Austria in Table 3 (also Tables 4
and 5)

       For example, Frankel and Froot (1986), Table 2a; Frenkel and
Levich (1975, 1977).

       14For example, Otani (1983) and Frankel (1984).

       15Clausen and Wyplosz (1982), Frankel (1982), and Giavazzi and
Pagano (1985, pp. 27—28), among others.

       16Political risk premiums on long—term bonds are not limited to LDC
debtors. In 1980—82 the U.S. government had to pay a higher interest rate
on U.S. bonds than European governments had to pay on Eurobonds denominated
in dollars. The same U.S.—Euromarket differential held for corporate
bonds. Both differentials fell sharply in mid—1982, presumably as
investors reacted to the international debt crisis by fleeing to the safe
haven of the United States. Interestingly, the short—term differential
(U.S. interbank rate minus Eurodollar) behaved precisely the opposite: it
was negative until it fell sharply after August 1982, suggesting perhaps a
completion of the liberalization process (begun 10 years earlier) relevant
only in the money markets. (Frankel, 1987b, Figures 1 and 2).

       17Thailand had a similar negative covered interest differential
during most of this period, according to a forward rate quoted by a Bangkok
bank; it went positive in April 1986. (Frankel, 1987a)

       18Argy (l987,pp. 132—36).

        '91t should be noted that the forward rate quoted by Barclay's
applies to the Saudi riyal. We match it up with the Bahraini interest rate
because no local interest rate is available for Saudi Arabia and the two
countries are said to be closely tied financially. The riyal is classified
by the IMF under the same exchange rate arrangement as Bahrain's currency,
the dinar, "Flexibility limited in terms of a single currency [the
dollar] ," which would suggest that the same forward rate could be applied
to both. Bat the riyal exchange rate does in fact vary somewhat, so that
our measured covered interest differential is not entirely legitimate.

       'A large literature tests and rejects the unbiasedness of the
discount in the forward exchange market. Given covered interest parity,
this is equivalent to the tests of unbiasedness in the interest diffe-
rential. The forward market literature is comprehensively surveyed by
Hodrick (1987)

       20bstfeld (1986b) in 1967—84 time series finds the highest saving—
investment correlation for the United States, followed by Canada, Germany,
Japan, Italy and Austria, and then —— with less significant coefficients —
France, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Australia.
       3Feldstein and Horioka used instrumental variables to correct for
endogeneity of saving. Defense expenditures and the retirement—age
proportion of the adult population are used as instrumental variables in
Frankel (1986, p. 41) for a U.S. time series context, and in Dooley,
Frankel and Mathieson (1986, p. 15) for a cross—section context. The two
papers also discuss the "big country" argument and other alleged econo-
metric problems. The finding of a high dependence of investment on saving
appears to be robust.

       4Harberger (1983) and Murphy (1984) argue that one would expect a
priori capital mobility (by the Feldstein—Horioka definition) to appear
higher for small political units than for large ones. Dooley, Frankel and
Mathieson (1986, pp. 24—7) takes exception to their argument.

       5Obstfeld (1986a) finds that the coefficient fell after 1973, in
time series correlations for most of his countries, but Obstfeld (1986b)
finds that it has risen over time (1967—84 vs. 1956—66)

       6For example, Frenkel and Levich (1977, 1981).

       7Frankel (1986) elaborates on this point. For similar treatments of
alternative criteria of capital mobility, see also Boothe, etal (1985),
and Obstfeld (1986)

       8E.g., Lanyi and Saracoglu (1983, Table 1) and Khatkhate (1985,
Table 7). On the other hand, Blejer and Gil Diaz (1985) provides an
example of a country, Uruguay, that liberalized financial markets and, as a
consequence, had a real interest rate that followed the foreign rate very
closely, turning sharply positive in 1980. Our three East Asian LDCs are
of this type.

       9The standard errors for individual country means are usable, indeed
conservative, despite the use of overlapping observations, because they are
calculated as if there were T/3 observations rather than the actual T
observations used.

       '°We classify Japan with Australia and New Zealand, rather than with
the large (G—i1) open industrialized countries, both because of geography
and because all three Pacific countries have only pursued financial market
liberalization in the 1980s.

       20The regression coefficients from the projection are not reported,
because they could be precisely recovered from those reported in Table 2b.

       21The means do not add up precisely, because a few more observations
are available for the covered interest differential than for the real
interest differential, which required ex post observations on inflation
rates.

       22The mean exchange risk premium for the nine smaller &iropean
countries aggregated, or for all 24 countries aggregated, appears stat-
istically significant. &it dollar exchange rate changes are highly
correlated across currencies, and standard errors that Ignore this
correlation are seriously biased downward. Seemingly Unrelated
Regressions, which properly take into account this correlation across
currencies, are used in Table 5c.

       '3Conventional estimates of the coefficient of relative risk—
aversion turn out to imply that, if the variances are constant over time,
exchange risk premiums should be very small in magnitude and variability.
&it many recent studies suggest that variances change substantially over
time, in which case the exchange risk premium should too. Frankel (1987c)
reviews this literature.

       24 the "rational expectations assumption" we mean, not just that
investors are rational, but also that their expectational errors can be
treated as white noise in small samples. The assumption could fail, for
example, because investors have to learn about a model that is changing
over time.

       25For example, Roll (1979), Frenkel (1981, p. 699), Solnik (1982),
Adler and Lehman (1983), Mishkin (1984, pp. 1351—53). However Qimby and
Obstfeld (1984), Huizinga (1986) and Longworth (1986) do manage to reject a
random walk. Longworth finds stronger rejections in the l980s than in the
l970s.

       26kkio (1984) or Frankel (1986).

       27Frankel and Froot (1985, Table 3) and Borensztein (1986). The
sample period was chosen on exogenous grounds.

       28The latter paper uses the survey data to analyze the exchange risk
premium; it finds that, contrary to the existing literature, the exchange
risk premium explains no positive amount of the forward discount or
interest differential. It would follow that the systematic component of
the forward discount prediction errors found in Table 5b Is not, after all,
an exchange risk premium.

       291f one uses the standard deviations of the projected differentials
instead of the ex post differentials, the R2 is .62 on the covered
interest differential and .23 on the real forward discount • The coeff i—
cients and their t—ratios give the same rankings as the R2'S but they
are not reported because no hypothesis is being formally tested.
