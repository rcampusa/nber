              MARRIACE BARS: DISCRIMINATIONACAINST
              MARRIED WOMEN WORKERS, 1920's to 1950's


                              ABSTRACT




Modern personnel practices, social consensus, and the Depression acted

in concert to delay the emergence of married women in the American

economy through an institution known as the "marriage bar."    Marriage

bars were policies   adopted by firms and local school boards,       from

about the early 1900's to 1950, to fire single women when they married

and not to hire married women.    I explore   their determinants    using

firm-level data from 1931 and 1940 and find they are associated with

promotion from within,     tenure-based   salaries,   and other    modern

personnel practices.     The marriage bar,    which had at its height

affected 751 of all local school boards and more than 50% of all

office workers,   was virtually abandoned in the 1950's when the cost

of limiting labor supply greatly increased,

     The labor force participation rate of married white women increased twenty-

fold over the past century.'    The expansion was concentratedalmost entirely in

the post-World War II period and appeared in two phases.      The initial increase

extended from the 1940's to the 1960's and affected older married women more than

it did younger women,    Employment among married women 45 to 54 years old expanded

four-fold from 1940 to 1960, while that for women 25 to 34 years old rose by

less than half that figure.    The second phase began in the 1960's, and its impact

was just the reverse.    Younger married women, particularlythose with pre-school

children, experienced greater increases in participation    than did older women.

The increase from 1960 to 1980 was    52   greater for the younger than the older

group.

     Many have traced the increase in female participation rates since the late

1940's to the rise in real wages     (Mincer, 1962; Smith and Ward,   1984, 1985).

Others have attributed the difference between the older and young groups to the

baby-boom   of the post-war period (Easterlin, 1978, 1980).    Younger women were

marrying earlier and having larger families, and thus could not partake equally

in the general increase in employment rates.    But the reason older married women

responded after World War II as never before to economic factors has remained

somewhat of a mystery.

     Their heightened reaction was due, in part,      to the better education   and


training they received when young compared with that acquired by most previous

cohorts   (Goldin, 1983).    It has also been asserted that World War II altered

gender relations   and norms that had previously circumscribed women's      roles,

although many revisionist histories have not supported this claim.         The war

itself, according to several recent studies, had little direct impact on women's

labor force participation (e.g., Campbell, 1984).


                                                                                -1-
      But many of the forces that eventually generated change in married women'a

employment
               -   - increaaed      education,   a markedly   reduced hirrh rate, and the

                                                   -- were apparent             as early aa
amergence of the clerical aector, to mention a few

the 1920'a,    Yet the proceaa of change in participation and in gender differences

in earnings and occupations was extremely protrscted.              Conditions in the 1930's

had much to do with the slow progress in the economic role of women, hut the

impact of the Depression often worked through preexisting                 social norms and

institutional barriers,            Before 1950 the labor market did little to accommodate

aarried and older women, and many employers barred their hire.               Married women

were barred from the position of reacher by the majority of local school boards

and from clerical work by many large firms.

      The notion that change in the female labor force was impeded prior to the

1950's is often inferred from the slow growth in participationrates of married

women before World War II and from the rhetoric of Depressionemployment policy.

Many other factors, however, could have intermediated.                The education,   first

occupation, and fertility            of a cohort influence the participation     of married

women,   and       these    cohorts-effects      are   maintained throughout the lifetime.

Differences in cohort effects, therefore, could account for the timing of change.

A pooled analysis of time-series and cohort data indicates that cohort effects

as well as period effects, such as unemployment, demand for female labor, female

wages, and so on, account for a substantial share of the change in psrticiparoin

over time and across cohorts (see Goldin, 1983; also Goldin, forthcoming, chapter

5).   But the residuals from this model are negative and large among older age

groups in 1920, 1930, and 1940.           Although the model explains much of the variance

in participation           rates   across cohorts and through time,     it is less able to


explsin why participation rates among older married women were low in the pre-


                                                                                         -2-
1950 period.2

       Thus older married women before 1950 had lower participation             rates given

all the other factors considered in the analysis.          Why   they did   is explored here

in an analysis of 'marriage bars," prohibitions against the hiring of married

women.    I discuss how modern personnel         practices, social consensus,     the Great

                                              in concert to delay the emergence
Depression, and individual expectations acted

of married women in the American economy.



1.0   Marriage   Bara

       Discrimination         against women is manifested in a variety of ways.      In its

most typical form no prescribed barriers exist.            Rather, employers,    employees,

and customers can express their prejudices against women workers by preferring

not to associate with them.           This form of discrimination   is often inferred from

its effects      on earnings        and occupations.    In other instances,      custom and

tradition are dominant and individuals are penalized for deviating.              Prescribed

barriers against the training and employment of women are perhaps the most easily

observed forms of discrimination.            Rules have existed barring the education and

training of women, as in the professions of law and medicine and among certain

medieval guilds and more modern unions (see Morello, 1986 on law; Harris, 1978

on the professions            in general).   In other circumstances,   rules   restrict   the

                                                                fire departments,
employment of women, as in the armed forces, post office, local

and legal profession.            The distinction between the two types of discrimination

--    the more   or less subtle revealing        of preferences and the rather obvious

prohibitions
                 -   -   is   often blurred when written rules do not exist but custom

dictates the result.

       Bars concerning the hiring and firing of married women, termed "marriage
bars," arose    in taacbing and clerical work from the late 1800's to the early

1900's and provide      the most numerically       important form of all prohibitions   in

their Impacr cn tha employmentof married women.             In 1920 just 11% of all married

women in tha lahor force were teachers and clerical workers, yet by 1970 the

percentage nearly quadrupled to 411.          The prohibitions covered, therefore, what

ware to becoaa the most frequent occupations for married women in the post- 1950

era,   In contrast, prohibitthns against the training and employment of women as

doctors and law'yera,      oroba'oly    the beat   knon   of all bans, affected a trivial

percentage    of women,3      It ia also of interest         that marriage bars covering

clerical and other orcupaticns have existed arroaa a variety of countries and

have only recently        been prohibited in Japan by its 1985 Equal Employment

Opportunity Law,4

       Prohibitions    against the employment of married women consisted         generally

of two bans    -.   one against the hiring of married women and a second concerning

the retention       of existing workers when they married.          The first ban will be

referred to aa the "hire bar" and the aecond as the "retain bar."                   It was

uncommon for a firm to hire married womeo yet fire single women when they

married,     But firma often banned the hiring of married women yet retained single

employees when they married.           When firms can acreen beginners for valued traits

or when firms invest considerably in training their workers,               firing existing

workers    can be costly.      Some firms and many school boards allowed women who

married in service to remain as temporary workers or as substitute teachers, who

could be dismissed      at will and whose salaries were not based on tenure.         Firms

often imposed both the retain bar and the hire bar.              It was rare, however, for

a firm to impose the same prohibitions on men)

       The bar against women who married in service was the more restrictive            of


                                                                                        -4-
the two.    In the 1920's, young women were just beginning to extend their working

time after marriage.    At that time the older married woman seeking white-collar

employment was in an extreme minority,    in part because increased education and

decreased   fertility most affected cohorts born after 1900.

     The rationale for the marriage bars offered here and elsewhere (Cohn, 1985,

1988) is simply that the policy was profitable, even in the absence of what may

be termed clearly prejudicial views about the impropriety of married women's

emp1oyment     Even though firms lost many trained employees and restricted their

labor supply by refusing to hire married women, they gained considerablymore.

Precisely    why they gained is not yet      perfectly    clear,    and I   offer    two


complementary reasons that place considerable blame on modern personnel practices

such as fixed salary scales and internal promotion.           But   the marriage bar


policies also required certain precedents,     such as sex segregated occupations

and social consensus.

     Discrimination    against married women and older workers came rather cheaply

to firms in the pre-Worid War II period; the reduction in supply was small and

the loss in trainingwas minimized by the types of occupations routinely offered

women.      Firma also perceived   there were gains    to policies that     guaranteed

homogeneity across sex, race, age, and marital status lines within occupations.

But many aspects of this equilibrium were deceptively fragile and were to change

radically during and after World War II.

     By the 1950's firms could no longer ignore older, married women and certain

aspects of the work place were altered.       The marriage bar, which had at its

height affected 75Z of all local school boards and more than 50% of all office

workers, was virtually abandoned in the 1950's.       The rhetoric of the work place

changed as well.      Where a married woman was once an anomaly,     perceived      as an


                                                                                      -5--
inefficient    workec,    she was now the coveted employee.        In mid-l950's      one


personnel director, whose firm had previously barred married women, praised older

women's "maturity and steadiness," and another noted "they are more reliable than

the younger ones."6




1.1 Extent of the Marriage Bar

       The extent of the bans across the entire economy has been difficult             to

assess.    These were, after all, the policies of individual firms and, in the caae

of school boards, individual localities,        Prohibitions   against the employment

of   married women teachers have been lass   difficult to track due to comprehensive
surveys of local school boards by the National Education Association                (NEA)

beginning in the late 1920's.
       Marriage bars were   instituted in public school teaching   sometime    in the late
l800'a    and were expanded in the early 1900's. Extensive surveys of local school

boards beginning with 1928 indicate that 61% of all school boards would not hire

a married woman teacher and 52% would not retain any who married while on

contract (see Table I).       Because the data are prouped in the NEA reports by size

of locality,   Ta'ole   I also weights the percentagaa by population.   T'ne   unweighted

data are generslly greater than the weighted data because large citiea had

proportionatelyfewer bars.        Both types of bars increased during the Depression,

and on the eve of American entry into World War II fully 87% of all school boards

would not hire a married women and 70% would not retain a single women who

married.     But sometime during World War II both bars disappeared.      By 1951 only

18% of the school boards had the hire bar and 10% the retain bar.

       The extent of the marriage bar in office work can be inferred from

information in two comprehensive       surveys conducted by the Women's Bureau (U.S.


                                                                                       -6-

employees, number of new employees, hours of work, personnel benefits (retirement

by the same governmental agency (the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of

Labor)     they are         similar   in   format,   although   that     for   1940   is     more

comprehensive.

        In 1931 12% of all firms in the sample had s formal policy of not retaining

single women when they married (see Table 1), but 23% of all female employees

were in firma having such a policy.            The policy, therefore, increased with firm

size,       Some    firms    did   not have a strict marriage          bar policy,     but   had

discretionary rules allowing them to retain able workers                to hire married women

when single were unavsilable, or to leave the policy up to department heads.

These are termed the 'discretionary" cases in the table. About 35% of all female

employees were working in firms thst would not retain them when they married as

a condition of both policy and discretion.            Considerably more firms had policies

against hiring married women than against              the retention    of single women who

married.11    About 29% of all firms had such policies in the 1931 survey and the

policies affected 36% of all female employees across these firms.                 More than 50%

of all firms in the sample dismissed women when they married as a condition of

policy and discretion, and the policy affected more than 50% of all female

employees in the sample.'2

        The policy of firing and hiring married women varies considerably with the

type of firm and with firm size (see Table 2).              Insurance offices, publishing

firms, banks, and public utilities had the most extensive                  controls in 1931;

insurance     offices,       banks,   public   utilities,    and the     office    portion of

manufacturing       firms had the most in 1940.       Large firms, measured by the number


                                                                                              -8-
of female employees, were more likely to institute such policies than were small

firms for both years'3     Although the marriage bar policy varied considerablyby

city in the 1940 sample, it did not in the 1931 sample, given the industrial

distribution.

     Tables 1 and 2 suggest an increase in the marriage bar policy during the

Great Depression.     The data in Table 2 that array policies by size of firm    show

some increase during the 1930's, particularly       for the marriage bar as policy.

The Kansas City and Philadelphia percentages for the retain and hire bars in 1940

are, with one exception, greater than the average for 1931, but the Los        Angeles
data are not.14     The extent and even existence of the increase is difficult     to

discern because the 1931 survey includes only large firms, and the industrial

distribution of firms as well as the cities covered differs across the two

surveys.

     One way of handling the problem of composition       is to pool the two samples

and include firm size, industry and city dummy variables, and a year variable

to estimate the impact of the Depression.       Equations estimated in this fashion

exhibit a positive, large, and significant effect of the Depression, in the case

of the hire and the   retain bar as   policy.   But the discretionary-policy   version

of both the hire and retain bars did not change over time.15 The Depression, it

seems, led firms to extend a discretionary marriage bar into the realm of firm

policy.    Where firms had exercised discretionin the hiring and firing of married

women before the Depression and during its first year, they instituted strict

policy not to hire and not to retain married women by 1940.

     Philadelphia    was the only city sampled in both years and provides further

evidence   for the extension of the marriage bar during the Depression.        Of the

41 firms in the 1931 sample for Philadelphia, 23 were also sampled by the Women's


                                                                                  -9-
Bureau in the 1940 survey.        Of these 23 firms, 11 experienced no change in

existing bans agsinst the employmentof married women.17 Because the respondents

in the 1931 survey often noted that the policy was a Depression measure, and

because the data were coded aotordingly, the results indicate that the marriage

bar, in both the retsin arid hire versions, predsted the Depression among firms

hiitng office workers,        The precise degree that it did, however,      cannot be

aacercained with these date.      There is, however, ample evidence in Table 1 that

                                                                  and that the
marriage bare instituted by school boards preceded the Depression

bars in both sectors were expanded during the 1930's.      T'ne   extensions, however,

often cook the form of governmental        regulations   that greatly strengthened


preexisting social norms and conventions.

     Federal Order       213, passed in 1932 as part of the Federal. Economy Act,

mandated that executive branch officials, in the face of layoffs, fire workers

whose spouses were employed by the federal government.         The regulation almost

always entailed the firing of married women, although many husbands could have

been furloughed.    By 1940 26 states had proposed legislation to restrict married

women's   employment     in state government jobs, and 9 others had some form of

restriction    already   in place (Shalleross, 1940).    Similar regulations      became

                                                and served to expand the group        of
effective   among various local governments

affected occupations to include librarians and nurses, although they too were

probably covered by prohibitions prior to the Depression.18

     Federal Order 213 and the actions of state          and local governments      lent
credibility to pre-Depression policies of businesses and local school boards and

enabled the extension of a system already in place.             The bar was extended to

occupations and to sectors, such as manufacturing, where it was not extensively

found before the Depression.          The Depression served to reinforce      social norms

that kept married women, particularly the emergingmiddle class, out of the labor

force.    Because the bars were extended during the Depression, and because they

were often justified by the need to ration employment among the most needy, many

have thought marriage bars originated in the Depression.          But it is inconceivable

that marriage bars could have gained such wide acceptance during the Depression

had previous policies not existed and had social consensus not been built around

them

       Economic    recessions are often periods of social recession,          when already

discarded       and outmoded forms of gender relations        are extolled.     It was no

accident,       for example,   that differences   in wages between men and women for

similar    work were scrutinized        in a federal survey taken      in 1895/96    (U.s.

Commissioner of Labor, 1897) to establish that women were not taking jobs from

men.      The    report was ordered    by Congress during a severe depression when

unemployment rates in the manufacturing sector were, for a brief period, as high

as they were to be again in the 1930's. similarly, periods of economic expansion

often provide an impetus for progressive social change, as happened in the 1950's

when the marriage bars vanished.



1.2 Firm-level Evidence,       1931 and 1940

       The correlates of the policy of not retaining single women at the time of

marriage (Retain) are explored in Table 3.        A   somewhat different set of variables

could be included for the more comprehensive survey of 1940.            In both 1931 and


                                                                                      -11-
1940, there is a positive. yet weak, relationship between the number of employees

in the firm and the probability of not retaining women who marry (also see Table

2 on the effeot of firm size).          But in both samples, the impact of firm size

declines when factors concerning         personnel relations    are included.       Size,   it

        Another variable related to internal promotionwas        the existence of certain

                                                                            as
jobs for which only men would be considered (Male only), and that variable,

well,    is positively associated with the retain bar policy.            Although some of

these jobs were supervisory and others were professional,            the vast majority were


starting jobs, such as messenger,         mail boy, and file clerk.        The greater the


number of these, the more extensive the internal promotion in the firm.'9

        The   results    indicate   that fins with established        personnel     practices

                                                 fins with     lower hours, possibly due
to work-sharing policies, and lower growth rates were more likely to have the

marriage bar.2°

     The coefficients on most variables are sufficiently large to have greatly

influenced the marriage bar policy.         In the 1931 data, for example, a firm with

300 employees and a work week of 40 hours would stand a nearly negligiblechance,

3.5%, of having the retain bat as policy.             But had the firm, in addition,   a

policy of internal promotion the probability would rise to 14.9%.         If hours fell

from 40 to 35, say because of depressed economic conditions, the probability of

the retain bar would rise further to 29.3%.        In the 1940 data, the same original

firm, however, would have a      154%   probability    of the retain bar, increasing to

24.7% with a policy of internal promotion, and to 43.4% with a decrease in hours

to 35 from the original 40.      Thus the 1940 firma had a much higher chance, from

1.5 to 4 times in these examples, of having the marriage bar independent of their

personnel practices and hours.      Further, the impact of the Promote variable is

less in the 1940 data than the 1931 data.        The implied change in the probability

of the retain bar with the internal promotion policy is 0.168 for 1931 but 0.076

for the 1940, computed around the means.2'

      All of   hs   implies that during the Depression firma joined a band-wagon

that had sanctioned tt.e firing of women who married and their wholesale banning

as employees.     Some firma in the Depressionenacted the bar for reasons similar

to   those   of firms   in the    1920's,    but many others,     particularly in the

manufacturing   sector, were seeking ways to cope with employment       cutbacks.   They

found precedent and consensus in discrimination against married women.

      The presence of the maximum age policy raises further questions         about the

hiring of women.     In some instances the policy was related to the existence of

pensions or group insurance that were not experience-rated, and maximum age rules


                                                                                    -13-
shielded the firm from paying out more to employees then had been accumulated,22

The policy constreined borh men and women searching for jobs in their mid-life,

but provided greater restrictions for women who lacked continuity in the work

force.   For men, the new personnel practices often meant that tenure with firms

was encouraged and frequently        ensured.    But for women, the new institutional

arrangements became added bars to their reentry at mid-life,

     The Women'   s   Bureauschedules contain, in addition to the easily quantifiable

information just analyzed, comments of personnel directors and agents of the firm

revealing their justificationa       for marriage bar policies.     The reasons elicited

for the marriage bars often confound the firms' actual constraints,            individual

prethdices,   and societal norms.        Some firms expressed concern that women who

married in their employ might become lesa efficient because they would leave in

the near future.      A personnel officer in a Philadelphia insurance firm noted that

although his firm had no official policy, he would prefer women leave on marriage

because "they were less efficient after marriage -- too much temporary didn't

care attitude,"23      Other agents, concerned that by firing women who married they

would lose valued employees, put them on probation.        A Philadelphia bank official

stated "that those who marry are told that the company reservea the right to

dismiss them at any time so that those whose work deteriorates after marriage

can be dispensed with."24          Some firms    actually reversed earlier bars,       like

Provident Mutual Life Tnsurance of Philadelphia which had a bar in 1924 but found

that "too many valuable [employees] were lost."22

     Most officers, however, gave no rationale for their policies, and a few

offered personal reasons.         An agent in the publishing industry noted that "men

are too selfish and should have to support their wives," and another, employed

by the Presbyterian       Board   of Christian    Education,   thought   "personally   that


                                                                                       -14-
married women should plan to be in their homes if possible."26            Many personnel

officers and other agents appeared to take great pride in answering that their

firms gave preference to married men in hiring and in salaries, and to married

women whose husbands were unemployable.          After all, social consensus      in the

1930's labor market was built around rationing jobs by need, the notion that men

should earn a "family wage," and norms circumscribing           the economic role of

married women.

        One surprising aspect of the comments is that various firms did mention they

gave small dowries or vacations when female employees married, but these were

always firms that retained single women and hired married women,            In Hartford,

where most insurance companies had both the hire and retainbars, Phoenix Mutual

then,    that   firms encouraged   young women   to marry,   in the same manner that

pensions encourage retirement.

        Marriage bars therefore were instituted by large firms, with centralized

hiring promot4.n     fccin   thin,   salary schedules that were often fixed and based

on tenure with the fita, and other modern employment practices.             The evidence

suggests that firms may have wanted to encourage turnover when earnings rose more

rapidly with tenure than productivity.         The experience of local school boards

with the marriage bar echoes that of firms hiring clerical workers, although the

evidence is at a more aggregated level.




                                                                                    -15-
1.3 Complementary          Evidence fcom Local School Boards

       Sometime       in        the    early     twentieth    century,    school    boards    instituted

contractual         obligationa with teachers and fixed salary schedules.                     The stated

purpose of salary schedules was to elicit appropriate effort from teachers with

a minimum of bickering. Although the precise timing is not clear, bars against
the hiring and retention of married women appear linked to these arrangementa.29
       Salary       schedulea         varied widely across the thousands of American school

boards by the stipulation of minimum and maximum salaries                           salary increaenta,

and thus the number of years of poasible increase,                       Salary schedules, therefore,

did   o,ot   cisc limitlessly.           By 1923 the vast msjority of school boards had adopted

a salary schedule,              and the average elementary-school           teacher would hsve taken

6 to 2 years to achieve maximum salary.3° The schedules were further complicated

by provisions for increases with training and summer school and for off-scale
increments called supermaximum salaries.

       As in the case of office workers, the policy of marriage bars was pursued

more vigorouslywhen the potential labor supply of already married women seemed

slender       and    when general              economic   conditions     called for       reductions    in

personnel.31         It should also be noted that the legalityc f the marriage bar was

often in doubt, and in 1941 courts                         in 22 states     ruled   tha    marriage bar

"capricious and unjust."32

       The firing of married school teachers was justified by contemporaries                            in

various ways.         There was a reason to fit anyone's prejudice,                   ranging from the

moralistic - -        that      married women with children should be home taking care of

their own --        to   the Victorian --          that   pregnant women would be objectionable         in

the classroom         --   to   the economic --       that   married women were less efficient and

became entrenched.33              As in the case of office workers, the marriage bar for


                                                                                                       -16-
teachers was successful because most Americans could justify and rationalize it.




       Thus the evidence from local school boards and firms hiring office workers

suggests    that marriage bars are associated with fixed salary scales, internal

promotion,    and other personnel       policies,     and that they flourished when the

potential     sacrifice    from limiting labor         supply is minimal.             The   bars,

interestingly, were rarely found among         firms hiring factory       operatives for whom

piece-rate payment       was   often used (47Z of all female operatives            fn the 1890's

were on incentive pay) and for whom, therefore, the relationship between earnings

and productivity was strictly maintained.             The only important exception I have

encountered    is that of electrical       machinery    operatives      (Schatz, 1983)      in two

large    manufacturing     firms    (General   Electric      and   Westinghouse)    both having

extensive, modern personnel         practices similar to those in office work.34               The

sectoral    distribution       of the marriage bar creates a prima facie case that it

emerged when the relationship between pay and productivity was severed.                      There

were few    costs,    and much to gain,    from both forms of the marriage bar in the

1920's, and the possible benefit grew during the Depression.               But increased costs

were    lurking In   the background.




1.4 Explaining the Marriage Bar

        Social consensus has so often been built around barring the employment of

married women that the original reason for the marriage bar has been obscured.

A   frequently       encountered     interpretation     of    these    prohibitions      involves

discrimination against educated, middle-classmarriedwomen, particularlynative-

born and white women (see, for example, Kessler-Harris,                   1982).     The covered


occupations,     teaching and clerical work, almost always required high-school


                                                                                              -17-
education,    and thus many have claimed the hans were intended to limit the

employment        of educated,   middle-class married women.      Female operatives in

manufacturing,       waitresses, and domestic servants, on the other hand, were often

foreign horn and black, and their positions were generally unaffectedby marriage

bans,    To this way of thinking, the bans served tc maintain a threatened status

quo, keeping middle-class women in the home to take care of their families.            Yne

bans,    in this light, were a reaffirmation of a legal and social system marred

hy patriarchy.

        The personal prejudices      of employers, as expressed in the 1940 survey,

indicate that certsin firms may have passed the matrisge bsr policy to limit the

employment of middle-class         women,   But the correlation     cf the policy with

vsriables concerning personnel policiee indicates that, while personal prejudice

may have been satisfied, other considerations were paramount.
        Another explanation of bans is that employers in firms with rigid wage

systems, tied to their workers'        seniority, desired a young, inexperienced work

forte, particularly in times of unemployment.           When managers are unable to set

wage stales for separate jobs, as might be      tb-c   case when there is o strongunion,

certain positions could have earnings that rise more rapidly          then- productivity.


At some point, therefore, earnings for certain individuals will exceed their

productivity,       and the firm will wsnt to terminate their employment.        Routine

clerical work in large-stale firms provides a possible instance in which the job

was     simple,    repetitive,   and not accompanied      by m continued    increase    in

productivity with experience on the job.               The marriage bar was a socially

acceptable way of terminating        the employment    of young women whose wages would

eventually exceed their addition firm revenue.

        The position that labor turnover was desired has been convincingly argued
elsewhere for the case of two British firms, the Great Western Railway and the

General Post Office,      (Cohn,   l985).      Because salary schedules     in these firms

rose with tenure presumeblymore then did productivity, some experienced workers

eventually beceme too         expensive   end cheeper beginners      were preferred.     For

reasons that will become clear, it wee women, not men, whom these firms desired

to dismiss.    Firms found it edventegeous to pay workers lees then their worth

at the beginning of their employment, but more leter on,             At some point, eey in

5   yeere, the (present discounted) velue of the peyment scheme would just equal

one in which the employee were peid her true value to the firm et eech date.

At 5 years, then, both firm end employee would be even.                The purpose of such

salary schedules is often to reduce monitoring              end supervisory costs.     But if

workers do not leave the firm at the "breek-even" point, eey at 5-years, the firm

can lose money each day the worker remains.                Of course, if the worker leaves

before the breakeven point, the worker will have               bet, end   it is this espect

of the scheme        that keepa    workers    in   line.     Rather than have systematic

supervision,   a policy of eporedic monitoring with dismiseel              of unproductive

workers will be more effective the heevier is the penelty.             Under the system of

paying wnrkers lees at the outset end more lacer, workers are, in essence, bonded
to   the firm, and   firing   compels them    to forfeit the bond.

      Cohn's reasoning is similer thet of Lesser (1979, 1981) concerningmendetory

retirement end hours reetrictione.           But in the case of msrriege bers firms went

to dismiss workers at s rather early point in their employment.            Most young women

were hired at around 16 to 18 years end most married in their early twenties.

Firms, therefore, could treat a 5 to 7 year period me the expected tenure for

young women, since most would leave at merriege in any case.                The office jobs

assigned to women did not entail much productivity              increese over time end, in


                                                                                         -19-
contrast to thsir male counterparts, few would receive promotions from within.

Thus    the marriage bar ensured   that all women left after a relstively short

period and that the firm would not have to support high-priced            experienced

workers at the expense of cheap beginners.     Becsuse the marriage bar did not set

a specific age or time period, young women could evade "early retirement" through
late marriage. Substantial dowries, according to Cohn, were therefore offered
to women who married after at least 6 years of company service. The dowries
were meant to   ancoursge young women to marry and thus leave the firm, in the face

of   their rising reel     but constant productivity
                         wages
     While various facts in the American case acer onsistent with this

explanation for the marriage hers, others are not. Marriage bars, it was found,
are    associated with fixed salary scales, internal promotion,    and other personnel

practices and they are not associated with piece-rate work,         Severiog a strict

                                                              some manner, to
relationship between productivity and earnings is related, in

the institution of marriage bars.      These facts lend support to the notion that

turnover was desired for the reasons just outlined.

        But firms did not seem to care if single   worsen   remained indefinitely with

the firm.     It was marriage, not age nor experience, that mattered,36      They were

also less concerned about retaining women who married in service than shout

hiring married women.      Among ffrms that had some form of the bar in the 1931
                                                                   not hire a
sample 49% had the hire bar but not the retain bar, and thus would

married women but would retain a single women who married.37          Barriers   to the


hiring of married women can not be attributed to a simple desire to increase

turnower.     Rather, auth barriers can be viewed as reflectingvarious prejudices

concerning married women's employment.       Firma may have believed that married

women were less productive in general, but that single women could be screened


                                                                                   -20-
on the job before marriage.          Thus it appears that many firms did not want to lose

skilled and trusted employees.            In fact, the sectors with the most restrictive

policies, often had female employees with the longest          tenure.   Further evidence

against the turnover thesis is that American firms with dowry arrangements               did

not institute marriage bars,           contrary to the British experience described by

Cohn.

        Of most significance,        the salaries    of ordinary female clerical workers

(e.g. ,   typists,      stenographers> rose by only 1.44% annuallywith tenure (see Table

4),39     Thus the difference        between productivity   and earnings could have been

increasing at a maximum of only 1.44%.              The 1.44% figure is a maximum because

part of it may reflect true productivity              increases.   Further,   fixed   salary

scales, often written into labor contracts and found in personnel brochures, did

not rise continuously with time and became level at about 6 years for women.

        If the marriage bar were intended to get rid of workers at, say, 5 years

tenure, then the break-even point between a flat profile and one that rises at

1,44% must be       5   years.   Beyond that point, earnings rise at 1.44% more than does

productivity    to the firm, assuming the worker's value to the firm does not

increase.     At b years of service, then, the employee's cost to the firm would

exceed her value by about 3% and at 10 years the figure would be about 11%, both

computed under the assumption that her value to the firm does not increase at

all.4°    Although it is possible that the difference was sufficient to make the

marriage bar policy profitable,           the slow growth in earnings with tenure casts

some doubt on the thesis.           There is, however, a related possibility.

        Employers       may have perceived that recently married female employees had

reduced productivity but found it costly to supervise,             fire, and reduce wages

on a discretionary basis.            The majority of young women in the 1920's left the


                                                                                        -21-
work force at the precise rime of msrriage or soon theresfter, more than 80% did

by estimates       presented elsewhere        (Coldin,      forthcoming,   chapter     2).     Firma,

therefore       may have been reluctant to retain recently married women who would

troat their jobs as temporary poaitions, be less docile,                      and less willing to

remain in the dead-end positiona all were aaaigned.                  Rather, they may have found

it more profitable to have rules governing the hiring and retention of married

women.     The reason that rules, rather than discretion, were preferred concerns

a set of related polities instituted by various firma in the 1920's.                              roe

policies include rigid salary aoalea, strict internal promotion lines,                            and

paternalism.       Thus rho       rationale here is related to that of        Cohn    The   personnel
polities and salary structures of certain firma caused rules rather than
discretion to be most profitable.
        Firms    often    adopt    internal promotion,      fixed salary stales, and benefit

packages to conserve on supervision costs and encourage efficiency and effort

among    employees        (see,    for example,   Lazesr,    1979;   Lazear    and Rosen,      1981).

Discretionary firing could result in greater wage demands to compensate employees

for the increased probability cf being terminated.                   In various incentive-based

models of the labor market (lszear, 1981, 1979;                      Bulow and Summers,         1986)

employees       base their salary demands on the expected probability                        of being

furloughed.       The gains from having rules rather than discretion increase if the

reduction       in labor supply from curtailing the employment of married women is

smell.

        Therefore,       the bar against retaining single women at marriage emerged, in

pert, from the various policies of modern personnel departments.                     These policies

mmdc discretionary          firing costly, end resulted in salary scales end promotion

procedures      that severed the relationship between wages end productivity.


                                                                                                 -22-
     Two complementary reasons have been offered for the benefits of the marriage

bar to firms: one involves a reduction         in the costs of paying experienced

                                               to firing workers.        But firms also
employees and the other a lowering of the cost

incurred losses from the bar.     Trained and trusted employees had to be fired and

no matried woman could be hired.       Marriage bats were adopted in the 1920's and

1930's because   these coats were low,      They were minimized by certain features

of the labor market.   The cost of firing women who married in service was slight

because the ancillary rule, the barring of all married women, entailed, at the

time, little sacrifice.      Costa were further minimized by the type of occupations

            offered women,     Elsewhere   I have discussed   how increased education

Jobs in the clerical sector were highly segregated by sex

much by having policies that required them to diamiaa women when they married.

instituted a marriage bar prior to the Depression and many extended the bar

a socially acceptable means of rationing employment during the 1930'a.



1.5 The Decline of the Marriage Bar in the 195D'a

     The 1950's mark a sharp break in the way the labor market accommodated

married women,     older     women,   and women with household reaponaibilitiea.

Discriminationnever disappeared and child-care centers never flourished.             But


after 1950 the marriage         bar vaniahed almost entirely (except        for   flight


                                                                                    -23-
 attendants41) and parttime work becarne widespread.     The factors that account for
 these changes acount to nothing short of a revolution        in the demographics      of
 labor supply.42

      Three-quarters    of all female workers in 1900, and more than one-half in the

 (non-war)   years   prior   to 1950, were single.     Not   surprisingly,           were
                                                                             they

exceptionally young.     The mean age of single women workers was 20 years in 1900,

and that of all working women was 23 years; but by 1950 the mean for all exceeded

36 years.    Employers in the 1920's and l930'e routinely hired only inexperienced

high school girls; "younger, untrained people direct from        [h.igh3 achool     prove
note aariafectory" was the frequent response of personnel officers.43         They had
little reason to look elsewhere,
                                      Young, single women flooded the labor marker

in these years; they were docile, educated, and had few home
                                                             responsibilities.
The labor market for women workers was
                                       organized for the young and was structured
around the presumption that women would remain at work
                                                       only until marriage.

     Demographic shifts of the 1920's and 1930's made many changes inevitable.

The decline in the birth rate, evident     n Figure   5.3, meant the population had

to age substantially in the coming years and that the supply of
                                                                young women and
female high school graduates had to decline as a
                                                 proportion of the population.
This "labor squeeze" was further exacerbated         by several related changes       --

increased education,    the post-WorldWar II decline in the
                                                            marriage age, and the
baby boom.44 Thus fewer young woman ware available for employment after the late

1940's, and those who might have bean ware marrying earlier and having larger

families.    For all these reasons    the supply of young,    single female workers

simply disappeared.     The data in Table 5 tell much of the story.

     The percentage    of the adult female population composed of 16 to 24 years

olds was 31% in 1900 but 20% in 1960.      The percentage of adult women who were


                                                                                    -24-
16 to 24 and sng1e was 21% in 1900 but 11% in 1960, and the proportional

decreaae ia even greater for those 18 to 24 years.            The proportion of 16 to 21

year olda at school was 1.7 times as great in 1960 than in 1900.                The largest

change in Table 5 involves combining        eli.   three factora      age, marital status,

and education --    into    a single measure. the percentage of adult women composed

of those 16 to 24 years old, single, and not at school, The measure             s   3.6 times

as great in 1900 as in 1960.     All three factots point to a decrease Ln the supply

of young, female emplcyees over the first half of this century.

     This inversion in labor acpplywas accompanied by a desire by older, married

women to seek gainful employment.        The young women of the 1910's and 1920's who

left high school and took clerical positions eventually became the older, married

women of the 1930's ard 1940's.          Most were past child-rearing        age, and as a

cohort they had few childrenby hisoricsl co'rperson.               Further, they had skills

the Depressionthey would surely have increased their lsbor force pertic.pation

earlier than the 1950's, and their partioipation           during World War TI creates a

prima facie case for that counterfactuml.

     Thus the constraints facing firms changed considerablywith World War II.

No longer did they operate in an environment of unemployment.              No longer could

they bar the hiring of married women without plmcing formidable restrictions on

their imbor supply.    Personnel polities quickly reflected these new constraints.

The procedures     end the    rhetoric   accompanying    them mre    revealed   in original

schedules of m 1957 study on personnel         polities (Hussey, 1958; called here the

1957 Hussey Report, see Data Appendix).

     Older female workers in the mid-1950's             were suddenly praised for their

maturity,   relimbility.     neat sppemrmnce, and less chatty nature.            Employers,


                                                                                         -25-
particularly in the clerical sector, were pleased to "rehire those who
                                                                      which
previously sened in that capacity," as did Penn Mutual Life Insurance

prior to World War II had a marriage bar.            Scott Paper hired married women who

r.ould "offer skills          gained earlier, before marriage," underscoring the finding

that a women's first occupationaltered her chance of future employment (Goldin,

1989.                           But in retail trades, particularly   in the suburbs, the

did not have to work was preferred by the major department storee.4

         all personnel- officers viewed the hiring of the older married woman with
        Not

equanimity. There were detractions aa we-Il ma benefits. In retail trade, one
manager       remarked that "Housewives who h.ave never worked or have not worked for

15 to 20 years are found to be inexperienced in arithmetic and have difficulty

in learning to operate the cash registers."            In banking, "older women may work

more slowly," but most added as well that "the type of aervice they can give a

company is of great value.
                                      "   Firms were still leery of hiring young married

women and acme adopted a policy of not hirin.g those with small children or firing

women wh-o became pregnant.           The sequel to the marriage bar was the "pregnancy

bar."        All    in all,    the beat female employee was,   in the words of a Sears,

Roebuck, and Co. officer, "a married woman with a mortgage on her house and her

children partially raised.

              the 1950's married women were welcomed employees       in almost all large,
        By
                                           World War II barred their hire.            The
paternalistic companies that just prior to

complete turnaroundwas a consequence of changed constraints,             The unemployment

of the 1930's, that compelled firms to ration jobs through means that included

 the firing of married women, had vanished and in its place was an extremely tight


                                                                                     -26-
labor marker.    The young woman of two decadea earlier who gave a firm several

years before marriage, waa replaced by one who left school later and married

eanier.      Firm aanagera knew the constraints, although they often overstated

thea: "In the earlier years, the girl of 18 might work until she aarried at 23

or 24           a she is more likely to marry within 6 aonths or a year of starting

work and resign within another.        But   it should also Dc   remembered that      the

older married woman of the 1950's Lad been the young woman of the 920's and

1930's.   The point dId nor escape    me   attention of firm officers    it   the   Hussey

Report who spoke of womer      returning   to positiona    they held decades before.

Despite their rusty matheaatcal skills, older married women of the 1950's were

considerably more equipped to handle modern clerical and sales work than were

their predecessors   in the 1920's.

     Altered constraints were not the only facrora that brought a shift in hiring

practices.    World War fl awakened firms to the fac" that bans against the hiring

of married women were lessening their supply of female employees              The number

of working women during World War II increased most among those older than 45

years.    From March 1940 to July 1944, the peek of the wartime employment             of

woaen, those 45 to 64 years old increased in numbers by        165   and those over 64

years by 197Z; in contrast, those 25 to 44 years old increased by only 128Z.

     The bans had little impact on potential      labor supply in the early 1920's

when the majority of older married women would not have joined the labor force

in any event,      But the bans became considerably       more binding and thus more

restrictive as tohorts of educated young women advanced in age.          By the 1940's

many in the cohorts who served as office workers when young were the mothers of

grown children, and by the 1950's the vast majority of adult married women had

high school diplomas.    It had been easy in the 1920's for firms to issue blanket


                                                                                      -27
policies against the hiring of married woman, but it was far harder in the 1950's

for them to bar certain kinds        of married women -- those with young children,

those with demanding husbands,       and so on.     So the bans were lifted, almost in

their entirety,     and the participation of married women in the American labor

force advanced in the abser.ce       of perhaps the most blatant form of eaployment

discriminationin the history of women's work.



1,6 The Long-Run impact of the Marriage Bar

     The bans restricted        the participation    of married women in the American

economy in several senses,       In the most obvious fashion they barred married women

from employment      in a varfety of occupations during the first half of this

century     But the marriage bars that preceded the Great Depressionmay have been

less overtly and intentionally discriminatory          than is apparent.   Marriage bars

constituted an odd form of discrimination against women.         The covered occupations

were almost always female-intensive ones, so it cannot be said that women aa a

group were discriminated against,          Social consensus was formed around and fueled

the rules, hut    t.he   dominant underlyingracionele was not necessarily a pcejudice

against middle-class       married women's working.

     As characterized here and in the work of Cohn (1985, 1988) the bars were

initially   related      to the adoption    of tenure-based   salary scales and related

personnel policies.        But they may also have resulted from perceived differences

in the efficiency of single and married female employees, and such beliefs may

not have been formulated in an unbiased fashion.         Dscriminatinn against married

women may have caused employers to have a jaundiced view of their productivity.

Both reasons offered here for the marriage bars are based on the fact that firm

policies segregated        office work by sex and routinely placed women in dead-end
positions.      But even had marriage bars been motivated entirely by unbiased, but

profit-maximizing      employers,    they encouraged others to find justificatior         for

their prejudices.         Social norms   against the employment    of married women that

preceded and fostered the bans and the extension of both the bans and social

norms during the Depression were a setback to -orking women.

        The   immediate   impact    of the bans in the    1920's    on the     labor    force


participation of married women may not have been substantial, but the longer

range    effectc    were ikely of great significance.            Young   women had little

                                                                  coverer by the
encouragement to invest in skills that were valued in the sectors

bars.     They might become typists and possibly machine operators             but they had

less    incentive    to become accountants.      The bats also prevented        firms    from

recognizing the hidden labor supply of older marrIed women           As the bars expanded

in the late 1920's and during the Depression             many married women who might

otherwise have looked for employment, were discouraged from doing so,                  As the

potential pool of educated and expertenced married women expanded, firms may have

underestimatedthe costs of the marriage bar policy.

        The bars in office work both before and during the Depression restricted

the employment of married woman but did not block their hiring,              Smaller firms

without modern personnel practices hired married women and did not fire single

women when they married.            Sectors   such as banking,    insurance,    and public

utilities, however, were off limits to married women, as were a large percentage

of local school boards around the country.        For offIce workers these prohibitions

often meant that married women were restricted from precisely those firms having

internal promotion possibilities.        While internal promotionwas never substantial

for women in any sector, the added restrictions lowered married women's returns

to education,


                                                                                         -29-
       A   sample of female clerical workers from the 1940 Women's Bureau survey (the

1940 OfficeWorker Survey) reveals differences between married and single women's

earnings, given years with the current employer, total job experience, educston,

and time spent between jobs in the home, among other relevant factors.        Married

-and   single women earned approximately the same on average, but the returns to

aducaton varied by marital status.       Returns were considerably lower for married

women, so that while women with lower than average education         received higher

aarnings if they were married, those with higher than average education received

lower earnings.      Returns to a year of eduration were 4.6% for single woaen but

only 1% for married women,50     The data suggest that married women were rhanneled

into firms. serrors, and jobs for which eduraton was of lower value parrirularly

within the internal promotion scheme.

       The extensive movement during the Depression       to ration jobs by firing

sarred women can be credited to       the marriage bars that preceded 1929.    Firma

rould hardly have built a solid consensus around the firing of married women had

it not been for the existence of marriage bars prior to the Depression.          The

bars, through a peculiar quirk of history, were responsible for the setbarks to

women's employment during the Depression.        In these ways, then, marriage bars

served to delay the period of increased female labor force participation           in

America

The most recent figure is 558% for 1988, yielding an increase of twenty-fold.
When the 1890 figure is revised for the undercount of married women working at

12 These suxsmary data are in general agreement with those from a national survey
cited in Cohn (1985, p. 99).    In that sample 51% of all offices did not hire
married women and 30% did not retain them in 1936 (when "supervisor's discretion"
is treated as no bsr).     For factory employment the figures are 39% and 18%,
however there is little evidence that factories had as extensive bars for
operatives in the 1920's as they did for clerical workers. Rather, it appears
that operatives were almost entirely unaffected by the marriage bar until the
Depression.

13.          the 1931 survey included only fins that had more than 9 female
       Because
employees, only such firms are included for the 1940 survey information in Table
3. Note the very small numbers of firms in the smallest size group for the 1931
survey and the substantial fraction of total female employees in firma with over
700.
14. roe differences between the 1931 and 1940 data are most apparent in Table
I.  Of the 12 possible cases, the percentages are all greater for Philadelphia
and Kansas City in 1940 than for rhe aggregate in 1931, with the exception of
the unveighted, hire (diacretonary and policy) case for Kansas City in 1940.
roe 1940 Philadelphia data for the weighted, retsin (policy and discretionary)
case is juar 0.2 percentage points lower than that for the aggregate 1911 data.

It is not deer why Los Angeles is an outlier. It is possible that only large
cities in eastern and midwestern states had extensive
                                                      marriage bars; western
cities may have had less restrictive policies, iO general, against female
employment.

15. The coefficients on the dummy variable for the 1930's sample are: 0904 (t —
1.67) for the case of the retain bar as policy and 0,928 (t 2.20) for the rose
of the hire bar as policy.     An insurance company in Philadelphia with 300
employees, for example, would have had a 23,4% probability of the retain bar in
the 1931 sample, but a 43.0% probability in 1940.

16. One firm actually changed each bar in the opposite direction and is included
with the group experiencing no net change. Of the 10 that increased the bar,
4 changed the retain bar only, 3 changed the hire bar only, and 3
                                                                    changed both.
The increased bar occurred in three ways: S fins moved from a discretionary bar
to a bar policy; 2 moved from no bar to discretionary; and 3 moved from no bar
to a bar policy.   Fully 50% of the increase reflects a change from discretion
ro rule, providing further evidence to support the pooled regreasion results that
many fins during the Depression merely changed discretionary policies.

17.    See the discussion in Schsrf (1980), for example.

18. On legislation passed and proposed during the Depression see Shallrross
(1940) and Kess1erHarris (1982); a detailed history of Federal Order 213 ran
be found in Schsrf (1980, chap. 3). See also Wandersee (1981) on the impart of
the marrisge bar during the Depression.

19. A similsr vsriable for "female only" jobs, those for which men would not be
considered, was not significant and wss omitted.


                                                                            -32
20. Note that the 1931 results may reflect        the decline in hours during the
initial onset of the Great Depression.

21. The computations use the logit regression coefficients in Table 3, column
(1) Retain Bar "As Policy," for both years. To compute the chance of having the
retain bar, the coefficients ($) are multiplied by their mean values (X), in
this case the 40 or 35 hours week, the 300 employees? and a 0 or I for the
Promote variable.   The equation for the probability (P)      ?
                                                              a logit estimation
is: P   l/1 + exp(-Xflfl.  Th cosputstons for thn cierge in thfr retsln bar with
the adoption of the internal promotion policy use the tormuls: BP/BPromote
P(l - P)$, where   is the coefficient on the Promote vsriable. The compcted data
for 1940 implicitly apply to either Philadelphia or Kansas Gity because of the
inclusion of city dummy varIables.

22. This discussion raises the possib1ity that retreaent end grtup £nsurence
policies changed between the 1920's and 1950's and became experience rated, If
they did, older comen in particular wou.d haie benefited, The possfbfllty tha'
some personnel practices changed raises the issue whether tenure-based wage
systems snd promotion from within were also altered in the 1950's to sccommodste
the large supply of older female employees.

29. Peters (1934, p. 25), in a volume on married women teachers in Virginia,
contains the only published evidence I have encountered on the urban-rural
breakdown of the marriage ban over time. According to his figures, the majority
of urban school boards in Virginia instituted a ban against hiring married women
before 1928, while the majority of rural school boards instituted the ban at the
start of the Great Depression. About one-third of all urban school boards having
a ban after 1932 had one before 1918, while only one-tenth of the rural school
boards had such a ban before 1918. This chronologyfits that of the institution
of fixed salary scales.

30. See National Education Association   (1923)

31. Margo and Rotelle (1981) consider the case of Houston, in which the marrisge
bar was established before World War I, then dropped during the war, only to be
reinstated after.

32. See Peterson (1987) who notes that        nSt.  Louis, where        the   bar was
established in 1897, no women had challenged it until 1941.
                                                                                 -33-
33. See Lewis (1925, pp. 185-88) who lists 31 frequently heard reasons why
married women should not be employed as teachers and 31 equally routed reasons
why they should.

34. There are probably other exceptions, particularly in manufacturing.    Orra
Langhorne, for example, in her 1886 volume     in Sketches from Pit inia (cited
n   Scott 1970, p. 122), noted that "married women are not admitted" in the
cigarette factories of Lynchburg in which white, single women snd black women
worked.

35. See also Cohn (1988) who analyzes one of the surveys used here and finds
support for his theory of "synthetic turnover."  Although my findings differ
somewhat from Cohn's on the details of the msrriage bat, our substantive
conclusions are quite similar.

36. In the case of stewardesses, however, it was often age ss well as marriage
that was cause for dismissal.

37. The 49% figure includes firma with the bar as polity and the bar as
discretionary course,  The figure is 62% for the bat as policy only. In 1940
the sane percentages are 42% and 52% respectively.

38. In New York, for example, 3fl of all female office wotkers had spent 5 or
more years with their present firm; but 44% of those in insurance companies and
38% of those in public utilities had (U.S. Department of Labor. 1934,
                                                                          p. 27).
The evidence for the other cities supports the conclusion here that there is no
clear relationship between experience with a firm and the existence of a marriage
bar.

39. The 14% figure is en average of the coefficients on years of current fita
experience for the two lower-skilled female groups in Table 4. The coefficient
on yeats of totsi job experience is larger in magnitude (see Table 4). but
presumably   it
              is the value of the individual's training to any firm. The notion
that fines pay workers less than they ate worth  atthe           and more
                                                         beginning         att-he
end    to nonserve on supervisory costs pertains to      difference between true
                                                      th-e
productivity   and earnings. Thus, the coefficient on years with the current firm.
also called tenure,   is the relevant figure.

40. Typists and stenographers typically began work at $70/month in 1940 (U.S -
Department of labor, 1942). If earnings rise at 1.4% per yeat hut productivity
does not and if the break-even point i5 5 yeats, the (constant) value of the
worker to the firm is around $73. That is, the present discounted value of $73
over 5 yeats is approximately equal to the present discountedvalue of a stream
of earnings that begins at $70 and rises by 1.4% each year for 5 years. At 10
years of service, for example, the worker costs the firm around $80/month but
she is still worth only $73, or 9.6% more than she is actually worth.

41. United Airlines recently lost a Title VII class action case (Rnmasanta     ti.
United Air Lines, Inc.) for firing stewardesses when they married.

42. Oppenheimer (1970, chap. 5) contains such a theory about the evolution     of
married women's labor market work.

                                                                             -34-

consists of 724 women, 168 of whom were married. It is discussed at length ir
Coldin (1984, 1986b). In a regression on the log of full-time yesriy earnings,
the coefficient on a dummy variable indicating rnsritsl status (1    married) is
                                                                   end years of

Notes:
Teachers:   Weighted figures use city population weights; the unweighted are
simple averages by number of school hoards,   City population weights are from
Historical Statistics (1975).   The "Do Not Retain" case is (1 - "may continue
to teach"); the "Do Not Hire" case, includes "rarely under special conditions"
for 1942 and 1950/51.
Office Workers: Weighted figures are weighted by the firm's female employment;
the unweightedare simple averages across firms in the sample. The 1931 sample
includes Chicago, Hartford, N.Y.C. , and Philadelphia.      Where possible the
responses apply to practices predating the Depression, although the interviews
were conducted in 1931/2. The 1940 sample includes Los Angeles, Kansas City,
and Philadelphia and refers to practices during the Creat Depression.   Figures
in parentheses are the number of observations.     "Discretionary" means firma
stated single women were preferred, married women were placed on special
probation, or the policy was up to the department head,

Notes and Source: 1940 Office Worker Surrey. Full-time earnings are wages paid
per last time period worked multiplied by the number of time periods per year.
Total experience — experience with current firm + experience at other office jobs
+ experience at jobs other than offices,         Lower-skilled occupations are
messenger, mail boy, various lower-skilled clerks, mimeo-mschine operators, and
so on. The typist-steno column also includes various machine operators. Higher-
skilled include professionals, supervisors, those in the accounting group, and
soon. The lower-skilled and higher-skilled groups were chosen for comparability
between male and female office workers; very few men in the sample were typists
and stenographers. Absolute values of 't'-ataristics are in parentheses.
