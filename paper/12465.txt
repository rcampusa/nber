How Has CEO Turnover Changed? Increasingly Performance Sensitive Boards and Increasingly
Uneasy CEOs

                                           ABSTRACT


We study CEO turnover – both internal (board driven) and external (through takeover and
bankruptcy) – from 1992 to 2005 for a sample of large U.S. companies. Annual CEO turnover is
higher than that estimated in previous studies over earlier periods. Turnover is 14.9% from 1992 to
2005, implying an average tenure as CEO of less than seven years. In the more recent period since
1998, total CEO turnover increases to 16.5%, implying an average tenure of just over six years.
Internal turnover is significantly related to three components of firm performance – performance
relative to industry, industry performance relative to the overall market, and the performance of the
overall stock market. Also in the more recent period since 1998, the relation of internal turnover to
performance is more strongly related to all three measures of performance in the contemporaneous
year. External turnover is not significantly related to any of the measures of stock performance over
the entire sample period, nor over the two sub-periods. We discuss the implications of these findings
for various issues in corporate governance.

I.     Introduction

       In the last several years, corporate governance in the United States has come under great

scrutiny, if not attack. The corporate governance scandals early in this decade led to the

Sarbanes Oxley legislation. Since the legislation, the criticism of corporate governance has

continued. CEOs are routinely criticized for being overpaid. Boards of directors are routinely

criticized as cronies of those overpaid CEOs. Jensen, Murphy and Wruck (2004) document the

increase in CEO pay since the 1970s. Bebchuk and Fried (2003) and Bebchuk and Grinstein

(2005) document a substantial increase in CEO pay accelerated after 1995. All three papers

criticize boards of directors for the increases in CEO pay and for not doing a good job

monitoring the pay practices and CEOs.

       While a great deal of work has focused on changes in CEO pay, recent changes in CEO

turnover and board behavior have received little attention. Earlier work and casual empiricism

suggest that the CEO’s job has become riskier over time. Khurana (2003) reports that CEO

turnover increased in the 1990s relative to the 1970s and 1980s. Murphy and Zabonjik (2004)

and Jensen et al. (2004) also report that turnover has increased in the 1990s, although the

magnitude they report is quite small – from 10% per year in the 1970s and 1980s to 11% in the

1990s. The samples in these papers do not go beyond the year 2000 so they are unable to

consider the period in which corporate governance and CEO performance and pay have been

subject to intense scrutiny.

       In this paper, we study CEO turnover from 1992 to 2005 for a sample of large U.S.

companies. We consider turnover that occurs through takeover and bankruptcy as well as

turnover in ongoing companies. When takeovers and bankruptcies are taken into consideration,

the job of CEO in large U.S. companies appears more precarious than before, particularly after




                                                 1
1997. Annual CEO turnover is 14.9% from 1992 to 2005, implying an average tenure as CEO of

less than seven years. In the more recent period since 1998, total CEO turnover increases to

16.5%, implying an average CEO turnover of just over six years. Internal or board driven

turnover also rises substantially, increasing from 10.3% in the first part of the sample to 12.8% in

the latter part of the sample. Looked at another way, only 35% of CEOs in place in 1992

remained CEO in 1997, while only 24% of CEOs in place in 1998 remained CEO in 2003.

           We then look at how turnover varies with firm performance. Previous work suggests a

modest relation between internal (board initiated) turnover and firm performance. (See Murphy

(1999) and Jensen et al. (2004)). We find a stronger and significant relation between internal

turnover and firm performance. Interestingly, internal turnover is related to three different

components of total firm performance. I.e., turnover is sensitive to the performance of the firm

relative to the industry, the performance of the industry relative to the stock market, and the

performance of the overall stock market.1 The sensitivity to a one standard deviation difference

in each of these measures is economically meaningful.

           Further, internal turnover after 1997 is more strongly related to all three measures of

performance. In fact, the sensitivity to performance appears to be greater than that in any of the

periods between 1970 and 1995 studied in Murphy (1999). Ironically, it appears that during the

period in which boards have been heavily criticized, boards have become increasingly sensitive

to firm performance and have acted more quickly and decisively.

           External turnover – turnover primarily related to acquisitions – is not significantly related

to any of the stock performance measures, nor do we observe any difference between the two

sub-periods as we do for internal turnover.

           Our results suggest a number of implications.
1
    Jenter and Kanaan (2006) obtain similar results which we discuss below.


                                                           2
       First, the results suggest an evolving role for boards. In a sample from the 1980s, Morck,

Shleifer and Vishny (1989) find that internal turnover is related to industry-adjusted performance

while external turnover from hostile takeovers is related to industry performance. They interpret

this as indicating boards respond well to poor performance relative to the industry, but do not

respond well to poor industry performance. The external takeover market becomes active in

reaction to poor industry performance and a need for restructuring.

       Our results suggest that boards now respond not only to poor performance relative to the

industry, but also to poor industry performance and to poor market performance. To the extent

that internal turnover has increased, boards also appear to monitor more frequently or

aggressively. One interpretation of these results is that boards – possibly encouraged by large

shareholders – perform both the role they performed in the 1980s and the role that hostile

takeovers played then.

       It is worth repeating that the results indicate that boards do not index CEO turnover to the

industry or the market. This is noteworthy in light of criticisms of boards for not indexing CEO

pay to the industry or the market. Bebchuk and Fried (2003) interpret the lack of indexing of pay

as a failure of governance. Our results on turnover in conjunction with those in Morck et al.

(1989) for the earlier period provide an alternative explanation. When an industry or the overall

economy performs poorly, it is sometimes efficient for the board to bring on a new CEO to

respond to the new industry or market conditions.

       Second, the results indicate that the CEO job is more precarious than has been previously

recognized. When external takeovers are included, the average tenure of a CEO has declined to

as little as six years for the recent 1998 to 2005 period. The recent tenures are substantially

shorter than those reported in previous work for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. For individual




                                                  3
CEOs, the shorter expected tenure likely offsets some of the benefit of the increase in CEO pay

over this period.

        Third, the shorter expected CEO tenures and sensitivity of those tenures to stock

performance have implications for the measurement of CEO pay. The shorter expected tenures

suggest that the estimates of CEO pay used in most compensation studies are overstated. Most

such studies use Standard and Poor’s ExecuComp data. ExecuComp estimates the value of

options grants using Black-Scholes. While option grants typically have a ten-year life,

ExecuComp uses a seven-year life because “executives rarely wait until the expiration date to

exercise their options.” This adjustment assumes that CEOs will remain with the company for at

least seven years. If a CEO has an expected initial tenure of six years, the ExecuComp

assumption will tend to overstate the value of option grants every year of the CEO’s tenure with

the overstatement increasing each year.2 ExecuComp also values restricted stock grants as fully

vested when, in fact, they usually vest over a period of time. This also will tend to overstate

executive compensation.

        The sensitivity of turnover to performance implies that the vesting and effective life of

stock options are not independent of performance. The options of CEOs of companies that

perform poorly will both have a shorter effective life and will be worth less. The Black-Scholes

methodology does not take these correlations into account. This, in turn, implies that a proper

valuation of stock options – e.g., using a binomial tree approach – would incorporate these

correlations.




2
  This assumes that CEOs forfeit unvested options and / or must exercise vested options when they leave the
company. Yermack (2006) finds that this tends to be the default policy and companies deviate from those policies
in 16% of the internal turnovers he studies. We discuss this in more detail later in the paper.


                                                        4
       Finally, shorter CEO tenures, the greater sensitivity to stock performance, as well as

higher CEO pay may have created a greater incentive for CEOs to engage in earnings

management or manipulation.

       This paper was written contemporaneously with Jenter and Kanaan (2005) who study

related issues in a sample of CEO turnover from 1993 to 2001. They focus on forced CEO

turnover, rather than all CEO turnover. Forced turnovers represent somewhere between 15% and

25% of total internal turnovers. As we do for forced and unforced turnover, they find that forced

CEO turnover is significantly related to industry-adjusted, industry, and market returns. They

focus most of their paper on verifying this effect for forced turnover and explaining why boards

might behave this way. They also study a larger sample of firms, but over a shorter time period.

Unlike us, they do not focus on the level of total turnover, the annual variation in that turnover,

and do not consider external turnovers. Given their shorter sample, they also do not consider

how turnover behavior changes from the early to later part of the sample.

       Our paper also is related to that of Mikkelson and Partch (1997) who compare complete

management turnover in US companies in two five-year periods – the active takeover market of

1984 - 1988 and the less active market of 1989-1993. In the active takeover period, they find

that 39% of firms experience CEO turnover and 23% of firms experience complete management

turnover; in the less active period, 34% of firms experience CEO turnover while 16% of firms

experience complete management turnover. They find that the decline in turnover frequency is

more pronounced among poorly performing firms. They argue that the activity of the external

takeover market affects the “intensity of management discipline.” Our results suggest that the

intensity of management discipline has increased substantially since the end of their sample

period, and likely exceeds the intensity of the active takeover period.




                                                  5
       The paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes our sample. Section III presents the

results for turnover levels. Section IV presents the turnover-performance regressions. Section V

summarizes and discusses the implications of these results.



II.    Sample and Data

       The sample of firms includes all Fortune 500 firms with data on both the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP) tapes and Compustat files (research and current files). The

sample runs from fiscal-year end 1991 to fiscal-year-end 2005. We construct the sample using

the annual Fortune 500 lists from 1992 to 2006. Each year, Fortune ranks firms based on sales at

fiscal-year end and publishes the list in an April or May issue of the following year. For

example, fiscal-year end 1991 rankings are published in an April or May 1992 issue. Table 1

provides summary statistics for the sample firms. Not surprisingly, the sample firms are large

with mean (median) sales of $7.5 billion ($3.9 billion). The number of observations increases

substantially in 1994 because Fortune changed its criteria for inclusion, broadening the number

of firms that could be included in the Fortune 500.

       We follow the sample firms from the first year they appear on a Fortune list until the end

of the sample period or until the firm exits the sample because of a merger, acquisition or

delisting from a major stock exchange. We identify CEO turnovers using the Fortune 500 and

Fortune 1000 lists, 10-K filings, proxy statements, Dun and Bradstreet’s Million Dollar

Directory, the Wall Street Journal and Lexis/Nexis business news searches.




                                                 6
III.   Turnover Levels

       Turnover in a given fiscal year, T, means that the CEO in the spring of that year is no

longer the CEO by the following spring. We measure turnover, therefore in the years 1992 to

2005. We consider two types of turnover. Standard or internal turnover is turnover that is

associated with a company’s board of directors. For standard turnover, a company remains

publicly-listed over the course of the year, but the CEO in the spring is no longer the CEO the

following spring. This is the turnover that is generally measured in studies of turnover. Non-

standard or external turnover is turnover due to a merger or bankruptcy / delisting. We also

consider the CEO to have been turned over if his or her company is taken over by another

company and he or she is not CEO of the combined company. We view this as an instance of

turnover because in many mergers the former CEO leaves the combined company. In those

instances in which the CEO former remains, the former CEO generally experiences a reduction

in pay and power. Total turnover is the sum of internal and external turnover.

       Table 2 presents the level of CEO turnover by year. Figure 1 presents this information

graphically. There are three noteworthy patterns. First, total turnover levels are substantially

higher than those typically reported. Overall turnover is 14.9% over the entire sample period

implying an average CEO tenure of 6.7 years. This is substantially higher than that reported in

Jensen, Murphy and Wruck (2004) and Murphy and Zabonjik (2004) who study a different

sample of large firms (from the Forbes lists) over three decades from 1970 to 2000. They report

turnover of 10.2% in the 1970s, 10.0% in the 1980s, and 11.3% in the 1990s. All of these

measures, however, are for standard or internal turnover. For our sample period of 1992 to 2005,

we obtain a standard turnover of 11.8%, similar to their results for the 1990s. At 11.8%, the




                                                 7
estimated average CEO tenure is 8.5 years, roughly two years greater than the actual average

tenure (that includes external takeover).

        The second noteworthy pattern in table 2 is the time series variation in the levels of both

total and internal turnover. Total turnover is as low as 6.4% in 2003 (and only 8.6% in 1994),

and as high as 25.0% in 2000 (and 19.8% in 1999).

        Third, turnover increased significantly in the latter part of the sample. In the earlier

period from 1992 to 1997, CEO turnover is 12.7% per year implying an average tenure of 7.9

years. In the more recent period from 1998 to 2005, total CEO turnover increases to 16.5%,

implying an average CEO turnover of 6.1 years. Internal or board driven turnover also rises

substantially, increasing from 10.3% in the first part of the sample to 12.8% in the latter part of

the sample. The increase in turnover is driven by very high levels of turnover from 1998 to 2002

and in 2005.

        It is natural to divide the sample period into pre-1998 and post-1997 because this break

roughly coincides with the large increase in CEO pay described in Bebchuk and Grinstein

(2005).3 The period in which CEO pay increased substantially coincides with a period in which

CEO tenure decreases substantially. It is worth adding that the increased level of turnover began

well before 2002 (when the Enron and Worldcom scandals became apparent and Sarbanes-Oxley

was passed).

        Table 3 presents the turnover data in a different way. We compare the fraction of the

CEOs in 1992 who are no longer CEOs in 1997 to the fraction of CEOs who are CEOs in 1998

and no longer CEOs in 2003. The table shows that 65% of CEOs in 1992 were no longer CEOs




3
  We used the same 1997-1998 breakpoint in the previous version of the paper. Because that version that did not
include 2005 turnover, the breakpoint represented roughly half of the sample.


                                                        8
in 1997, while over 76% of CEOs in 1998 were no longer CEOs by 2003. Again, this result

suggests that the job of CEO has become increasingly precarious over the sample period.

       The turnover also is substantially greater than that measured by Mikkelsen and Partch

(1997) over two earlier five year periods. In the active takeover period from 1983 to 1988, they

find that 39% of firms experience CEO turnover (and 23% of firms experience complete

management turnover); in the less active period from 1989 to 1993, 34% of firms experience

CEO turnover (while 16% of firms experience complete management turnover). Unfortunately,

these results are not directly comparable because the sample in Mikkelsen and Partch consists of

smaller firms.



IV.    The Relation of Turnover and Performance

       A. Internal Turnover

       We estimate probit regressions to examine the likelihood of internal CEO turnover. In all

of the probit regressions, the dependent variable is equal to one if a CEO turns over and zero

otherwise. The tables report the marginal changes in the probability of internal CEO turnover,

implied by the probit coefficient estimates that result from a unit change in the explanatory

variables. For indicator variables, the coefficient represents the change in the probability

associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1. These marginal sensitivities, labeled "∆Prob,"

are economically equivalent to coefficient estimates from ordinary least squares estimation. In

the discussion below, we focus on the significance of these marginal effects.

       In all of the probit regressions, three proxies are used to measure stock market

performance. First, we measure market performance using the annual return on the S&P 500

index. Second, relative industry performance is measured at the two-digit SIC code level and




                                                 9
equals the difference between the return on the median firm in the industry and the return on the

S&P 500 index. Third, relative firm performance is measured as the industry-adjusted firm stock

return, which is equal to the firm stock return minus the return for the median firm in the same

two-digit SIC code. All returns are measured at calendar year-end.

       In table 4, we report the results for two sets of probit regressions. In the first set of

regressions, we include measures of stock market performance and an indicator variable equal to

one if lagged CEO age is greater than or equal to 60 (CEO age dummy). In the second set of

regressions, we add the change in ROA as a measure of operating performance. For the first set

of regressions, we report the results for the full sample period and two sub-periods: 1992 to 1997

and 1998 to 2005. For the second set of regressions, we report the results for the period 1992 to

2004 and two sub-periods: 1992 to 1997 and 1998 to 2004 (because of data availability for

change in ROA).

       Table 4 shows that all three components of stock performance are significantly related to

internal CEO turnover.

       First, turnover increases with poor industry-adjusted performance over the entire sample

period and, particularly, in the latter 1998 to 2005 period. For the 1998 to 2005 subperiod, a

one-standard deviation (38%) decline in a firm’s industry adjusted stock return is associated with

an increase of 3.5% in the likelihood of CEO turnover. This sensitivity appears to be greater

than the sensitivities reported in Murphy (1999) for various subperiods between 1970 and 1995.

This is particularly interesting given that Murphy (1999) finds that turnover is not related to

industry-adjusted performance between 1990 and 1995.

       Second, CEO turnover is also related to poor industry performance. Again, the relation

appears to be driven by the second subperiod. For the 1998 to 2005 subperiod, a one-standard




                                                  10
deviation (22.5%) decline in industry performance is associated with a 2.1% increase in the

likelihood of CEO turnover.

       Third, lower overall market performance, as measured by the return on the S&P 500

index, is also associated with a higher likelihood of internal CEO turnover. For the full sample

period, a one-standard deviation (17%) decline in the S&P 500 index is associated with a

significant increase of 2.2% in the probability of internal CEO turnover. This relation is driven

by the second subperiod. There is no statistical relation between market performance and CEO

turnover in the first sub-period (1992 to 1997). In contrast, in the later period (1998 to 2005), a

one-standard deviation (18%) decline in the S&P 500 index corresponds to an increase of 2.9%

in the probability of CEO turnover.

       These results indicate that the relation between internal CEO turnover and overall stock

market performance appears to have intensified after 1997. All three sensitivities to stock

performance – 3.5%, 2.1%, and 2.9%, respectively, for one standard deviation changes in

industry-adjusted, industry, and market performance – are economically meaningful relative to

average internal turnover of 12.83% from 1998 to 2005.

       The second set of regressions in table 4 includes the change in return on assets (ROA) in

addition to the stock return variables. The results are qualitatively unchanged. The change in

ROA is marginally significant during the full sample period from 1992 to 2004 but it is not

statistically significant in the sub-period regressions. While the estimate is statistically

significant, a one standard deviation increase in the change in ROA is associated with only a 0.7

percent increase in the likelihood of CEO turnover.

       In table 5, we add one year of lagged performance variables to the regressions. The first

set of regressions excludes the change in ROA while the second set includes the change in ROA.




                                                  11
Consistent with the results in table 4, table 5 suggests that boards are sensitive to all three types

of stock performance over the entire sample period and increasingly sensitive to all three

measures in the later period.

       For the entire period, internal CEO turnover is significantly negatively related to

industry-adjusted and overall market stock performance in the current year. Turnover also is

significantly negatively related to industry-adjusted and industry performance stock performance

in the previous year. Strangely, turnover is significantly positively related to the lagged return

on the S&P 500. (One possible explanation is that CEOs choose to leave after a year in which

the market has done well.)

       As in the previous results, the regressions in table 5 indicate that the turnover-

performance relations are driven by the later subperiod. During the later subperiod, internal

CEO turnover is significantly related to industry-adjusted and industry stock performance in the

current year and previous year. Turnover is negatively related to the overall market in the

current year and positively related in the previous year.

       The coefficients in the first set of regressions imply that a one-standard deviation decline

in the S&P 500 increases the likelihood of turnover by a total of 0.9% in the entire sample period

and by 1.2% in the 1998 to 2005 subperiod (where we have added the current year and lagged

year coefficients). A one-standard deviation decline in the firms’ industry also increases the

likelihood of turnover by a total of 1.3% over the entire sample period and by 1.9% in the 1998

to 2005 subperiod. Finally, a one-standard deviation decline in industry-adjusted performance

increases the likelihood of turnover by 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively, over the entire sample

period and in the 1998 to 2005 subperiod. Again, the sensitivity to industry-adjusted




                                                  12
performance for the 1998 to 2005 period appears to be greater than any of the sensitivities

reported in Murphy (1999).

       In the earlier subperiod, 1992 to 1997, contemporaneous and lagged industry-adjusted

performance are significantly negative while lagged market performance is marginally

significantly positive. The sum of the coefficients (lagged and contemporaneous) for each of the

three stock performance measures is less negative in the earlier period than in the later period.

       The regressions that include lagged change in ROA indicate that boards are sensitive to

changes in operating performance in the later subperiods. However, a one standard deviation

change in the change in ROA is associated with a smaller increase in CEO turnover than a one

standard deviation change in the stock market performance. The differences in responsiveness to

stock performance over the two subperiods remain.

       Overall, the results in tables 4 and 5 suggest that since 1997, boards have been both more

sensitive to poor performance and have responded more quickly to that poor performance. It is

also worth noting that the economic magnitudes of the effect are large. For the 1998 to 2005

period, the coefficients imply that a CEO whose firm performs one standard deviation better than

the industry has a 5.3% lower likelihood of turnover while a CEO whose firm performs one

standard deviation worse than the industry has a 5.3% increase in the likelihood of turnover.

From a base turnover level of 12.8%, these imply likelihoods of 7.5% for the strong performer

versus 18.1% for the poor performer. These are economically meaningful differences with 7.5%

implying a tenure of 13.3 years and 18.1% implying a tenure of 5.5 years.

       Table 6 repeats the table 5 probit regressions dividing the sample into two sets of firms:

firms in the S&P500 index and all other Fortune 500 firms. We do this for two reasons. First,

many papers on executive compensation and corporate governance use the ExecuComp data set




                                                 13
that includes only firms in various S&P indices. It is possible there is a selection bias in these

firms. Second, investors may be more likely to pay attention to firms in the S&P 500 index, and,

if so, these firms would be more likely to be monitored by the press and institutional investors.

Thus, the effect of stock market performance might be different for these firms (Bertrand and

Mullanianathan, 2001).

       The coefficient patterns are qualitatively similar for the two sets of firms. Turnover in

both sets of firms is significantly related to industry-adjusted and market stock performance over

the entire sample period. As in the sample overall, the relations are stronger in the more recent

1998 to 2005 period.



       B. Internal Turnover and Governance

       Recent work has suggested that differences in corporate governance may have real

effects. Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003) find that differences in corporate governance are

related to stock returns. Masulis, Wang, and Xie (2005) find that those differences in corporate

governance are related to acquisition behavior.

       In this section, we examine the relation between turnover, market and firm performance

measures and governance. To do so, we use the GIM index developed by Gompers et al.

(2003). They categorize 24 charter provisions, bylaw provisions, and other firm-level rules

associated with corporate governance into five types: (1) Tactics for delaying hostile bidders, (2)

voting rights, (3) director/officer protection, (4) other takeover defenses, and (5) state laws.

Their overall index and the five component indices generally score one point for each provision

that restricts shareholder rights or increases managerial power. Thus, a higher index score

represents greater managerial power (weaker shareholder rights).




                                                  14
       We estimated turnover regressions that interact stock performance with the measure of

governance. We used both a continuous measure of the GIM index as well as a dummy variable

if the firm’s GIM index was in the highest quintile. To the extent that the GIM index measures

poor governance, one would expect the interaction terms to have positive coefficients.

       Table 7 presents our results for regressions using the dummy variable for the highest

GIM index quintile. For the sample overall and for each sub-period, the sum of the coefficients

on the interaction terms for current year and lagged stock returns are insignificant for all three

types of stock performance. In other words, governance does not appear to be related to turnover

for the sum of the two coefficients.

       The only way in which the GIM index interaction is significant is that turnover is

significantly more sensitive to poor lagged industry-adjusted performance for the high GIM

index firms during the overall sample period and in the 1998 to 2005 subperiod. The GIM index

interaction for current year industry-adjusted performance is significantly positive in the 1998 to

2005 period. Again, in both the overall and 1998 to 2005 subperiods, the net effect of the

interaction terms for the two years is to be insignificantly negatively related to industry-adjusted

performance.

       Although not reported in a table, our results also are qualitatively similar when we

interact stock performance with the continuous measure of the GIM index.

       Overall, then, we interpret these results as finding that the GIM measures of governance

do not have an appreciable relation to or impact on CEO turnover. Our results are consistent

with a contemporaneous paper by Bhagat and Bolton (2006) who also fail to find a significant

effect on turnover when they interact governance and performance.




                                                 15
        C. Forced Turnover

        Thus far, we have not distinguished between forced turnover and all other turnover.

Jenter and Kanaan (2006) focus exclusively on forced turnover. As we do for all turnover, they

find that forced turnover is related to the three different measures of performance. It is possible

that our results are driven by the forced turnover in our sample. To examine whether this is the

case and whether performance is related differently to forced turnover and standard internal

turnover, we estimate multinomial logit (MNL) regressions.

        We follow Huson, Parrino and Starks (2001) in classifying turnover as forced. (Jenter

and Kanaan (2006) also use this classification scheme.) Specifically, if an article indicates that

the CEO was fired, forced, or left following a policy disagreement or some other equivalent, then

turnover is defined as forced. For the remaining announcements, succession is classified as

forced when the CEO is under 60 and the first article reporting the announcement does not report

the reason for the departure as involving death, poor health or the acceptance of another position

elsewhere. Over the entire sample period, internal turnover is 11.79% per year. Forced turnover

is 1.87% while unforced turnover is 9.80%.4 Identifiably forced turnover, therefore, is infrequent

relative to all internal turnover.

        We present the regression results in table 8. The dependent variable categories in the

MNL estimations are no turnover, unforced turnover, or forced turnover. The table reports the

marginal effect of each regressor and the associated probability value (p-value) of the test that

the marginal probability is equal to zero based on asymptotic standard errors.

        The probability of forced turnover is significantly negatively related to the three

components of firm performance – firm performance relative to the industry, the industry relative

 The sum does not add to 11.79% because 12 turnovers could not be classified as forced or unforced based on
available information.


                                                       16
to the market, and the overall market – in the current year and to industry-adjusted return in the

previous year. The probability of unforced turnover is significantly negatively related to firm

performance relative to the industry and the overall market in the current year, and to industry

return and industry-adjusted return in the previous year.

       Overall, then, both forced turnover and unforced turnover are sensitive to all three types

of poor performance. This suggests that many unforced turnovers are not voluntary.



       D. External Turnover

       As discussed earlier, in addition to internal turnover, we examine external turnover.

Recall, non-standard or external turnover is turnover due to a merger or bankruptcy / delisting.

We consider the CEO to have been turned over in a merger if his or her company is taken over

by another company and he or she is not CEO of the combined company. We consider the CEO

to have been turned over in a bankruptcy if he or she is no longer CEO of the bankrupt company.

The incidence of external turnover is 3.1% per year over the sample period.

       Table 9 reports probit regressions of the probability of external turnover as a function of

stock market performance and operating performance. As in tables 4 and 5, we report the results

with and without the change in operating performance. We do not include current year

performance because firms are taken over or delisted in the current year.

       The results in table 9 show that external turnover is not related to any of the three

measures of stock performance over the entire sample period when we exclude the change in

operating performance. When we include the change in operating performance, turnover is

negatively related to industry performance relative to the market and positively related to the

change in operating performance. Even in this case, the marginal probabilities are economically




                                                 17
small. For example, a one standard deviation decline in industry performance over the sample

period (1992 to 2004) increases the probability of an external turnover by 0.08%.

       The insignificant results for external turnover and performance suggest that, on average,

takeovers during this period were not disciplinary in nature.



V.     Summary and Implications

       In this paper, we examine the extent of and determinants of internal and external CEO

turnover for a sample of large U.S. companies from 1992 to 2005. Total turnover, the sum of

internal and external turnover, is about 14.9% from 1992 to 2005, implying an average CEO

tenure of less than seven years. In the more recent period from 1998 to 2005, total CEO turnover

increases to 16.5%, implying an average tenure of approximately six years.

       Internal CEO turnover that is associated with a company’s board of directors is

significantly related to three components of firm performance – performance relative to the

industry, industry performance relative to the overall market, and the performance of the overall

market. These relations intensify after 1997 in that from 1998 onward internal turnover is more

strongly related to all three measures of performance in the contemporaneous year. These results

remain even after controlling for operating performance and governance measures.

       We also examine the likelihood of forced turnover, unforced turnover and no turnover

using MNL regressions. Both forced turnover and unforced turnover are sensitive to all three

types of poor performance.

       Finally, external turnover is not related to any of the three measures of performance –

industry-adjusted, industry and market performance – over the entire sample period.

       We believe our results have a number of implications.




                                                18
       First, the results suggest an evolving role for boards. In a sample from the 1980s, Morck,

Shleifer and Vishny (1989) find that internal turnover is related to industry-adjusted performance

while external turnover from hostile takeovers is related to industry performance. They interpret

this as indicating boards respond well to poor performance relative to the industry, but do not

respond well to poor industry performance. The external takeover market becomes active in

reaction to poor industry performance and a need for restructuring.

       Our results suggest that boards now respond not only to poor performance relative to the

industry, but also to poor industry and to poor market performance. To the extent that internal

turnover has increased, boards also appear to monitor more frequently or aggressively. One

interpretation of these results is that boards – possibly encouraged by large shareholders –

perform both the role they played in the 1980s and the role that hostile takeovers played then.

       It is worth repeating that the results indicate that boards do not index CEO turnover to the

industry or the market. This is noteworthy in light of criticisms of boards for not indexing CEO

pay to the industry or the market. Bebchuk and Fried (2003) interpret the lack of indexing of pay

as a failure of governance. Our results on turnover in conjunction with those in Morck et al.

(1989) for the earlier period provide an alternative explanation. When an industry or the overall

economy performs poorly, it is sometimes efficient for the board to bring on a new CEO to

respond to the new industry or market conditions.

       Second, the CEO job is more precarious than has been previously recognized. When

external takeovers are included, the average tenure of a CEO has declined to as little as six years

in the most recent 1998 to 2005 period. This is substantially shorter than the average tenures

reported in previous work for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.




                                                 19
       The shorter expected tenure coincides with the well-documented increase in annual CEO

pay over the same period. For an individual CEO, therefore, the shorter tenure partially offsets

the increase in pay. For example, the annual pay of S&P 500 CEOs roughly doubled in real

terms from the 1992 – 1997 period to the 1998 – 2004 period. Our estimates indicate that the

total pay of an individual CEO over his entire expected term increased by less than this because

the expected tenure at the higher pay declined by roughly ¼ to 1/3.

       This calculation would be inaccurate if severance agreements around internal turnover

and takeovers are both large and have increased over time. If, instead, the severance agreements

are small, then they do not have much of an effect on a CEOs total pay. And if they have

remained the same over time, then they increase pay by similar amounts in both periods.

Yermack (2006) studies separation payments made when Fortune 500 CEOs leave their firms.

While more than half of the CEOs in his sample receive compensation upon leaving, he

concludes that the mean payments are “modest,” averaging less than one year’s compensation.

He does not study whether these payments have changed over time. Hartzell, Ofek and Yermack

(2004) study benefits obtained by target company CEOs in acquisitions. Excluding gains on the

shares and options the CEOs already hold, Hartzell et al. find that the CEOs receive an average

of roughly $3 million (and a median that appears to be roughly $1 million) in benefits. They do

not study whether these payments have changed over time.

       Overall, then, the severance payments in Yermack (2006) and Hartzell et al. (2004) do

not seem large enough to alter the conclusion that the job of CEO has become riskier and that the

shorter expected tenures of CEOs partially offset the increases in CEO pay.

       Third, the shorter expected CEO tenures and sensitivity of those tenures to stock

performance have implications for the measurement of CEO pay. The shorter expected tenures




                                                20
suggest that the estimates of CEO pay used in most compensation studies are overstated. Most

such studies use Standard and Poor’s ExecuComp data. ExecuComp estimates the value of

options grants using Black-Scholes. While option grants typically have a ten-year life,

ExecuComp uses a seven-year life because “executives rarely wait until the expiration date to

exercise their options.” This adjustment assumes that CEOs will remain with the company for at

least seven years. If a CEO has an expected initial tenure of six years, the ExecuComp

assumption will tend to overstate the value of option grants every year of the CEO’s tenure with

the overstatement increasing each year. This assumes that CEOs forfeit unvested options and /

or must exercise vested options when they leave the company. For internal turnover, Yermack

(2006) finds that this tends to be the default policy for most companies and companies deviate

from those policies in only 16% of the internal turnovers he studies. The reasonableness of the

assumption is less clear and less well-documented in the (less frequent) instances of external

takeovers.

       The sensitivity of turnover to performance implies that both the vesting and life of stock

options are not independent of performance. The options of CEOs of companies that perform

poorly will both have a shorter effective life and will be worth less. The Black-Scholes

methodology does not account for these correlations. This, in turn, implies that a proper stock

option valuation – e.g., using a binomial tree approach – would incorporate these correlations.

       Finally, shorter CEO tenures, the greater sensitivity to stock performance, as well as

higher CEO pay may have created a greater incentive for CEOs to engage in earnings

management or manipulation.

Selected firm characteristics for sample firms. The sample includes Fortune 500 firms between 1992 and year-end
2005. Firm value equals the sum of the market value of equity, total long-term debt and the carrying value of
preferred stock. EBITDA/total assets is the ratio of EBITDA to average total book assets. Annual stock return is
the percentage change in the firm’s stock price at fiscal year-end. Change in ROA equals the change in the ratio of
the EBITDA to average total book assets. Market-to-book equals the ratio of firm value to average total book assets.
Sales growth is the percentage change in annual sales. R&D/Sales is the ratio of R&D expenditures to sales.
(Missing values of R&D are set equal to zero.) The quick ratio is the ratio of cash, marketable securities and
account receivables to total current liabilities. The current ratio is the ratio of total current assets to total current
liabilities. The modified Z-score equals the sum of 3.3EBIT, sales, 1.4Retained earnings, and 1.2working capital

Probit regression estimates of the likelihood of internal CEO turnover during the period from 1992 to 2005. The dependent variable equals one if the CEO turnovers and
zero otherwise. ∆Prob measures the change in the probability of CEO turnover per unit change in the relevant explanatory variables. For indicator variables, the
coefficient represents the change in the probability associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1. Models are estimated with robust standard errors to control for
heteroskedasticity. CEO age dummy equals 1 if lagged CEO age is greater than or equal to 60 and zero otherwise. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and
1% levels, respectively. p-values are in parentheses.

        Table 6. Probit regressions of relation of internal CEO turnover and performance for Fortune 500 firms in and not in the S&P 500 Index

Probit regression estimates of the likelihood of internal CEO turnover for Fortune 500 firms during the period from 1992 to 2005. Firms are divided into those in the S&P
500 index and those not in the index. The dependent variable equals one if the CEO turnovers and zero otherwise. ∆Prob measures the change in the probability of CEO
turnover per unit change in the relevant explanatory variables. For indicator variables, the coefficient represents the change in the probability associated with moving the
indicator from 0 to 1. Models are estimated with robust standard errors to control for heteroskedasticity. CEO age dummy equals 1 if lagged CEO age is greater than or
equal to 60 and zero otherwise. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. p-values are in parentheses.

                                and forced CEO turnover for Fortune 500 firms.

Multinominal logit regression estimates of the likelihood of no CEO turnover, non-forced CEO turnover and forced CEO
turnover for Fortune 500 firms during the period 1992 to 2005.. ∆Prob measures the change in the probability of the particular
choice per unit change in the relevant explanatory variables. For indicator variables, the coefficient represents the change in the
probability associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1. Models are estimated with robust standard errors to control for
heteroskedasticity. CEO age dummy equals 1 if lagged CEO age is greater than or equal to 60 and zero otherwise. *, **, and ***
indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. p-values are in parentheses.

Probit regression estimates of the likelihood of external CEO turnover for Fortune 500 firms during the period 1992 to 2005. The dependent variable equals one if the CEO
turnovers and zero otherwise. ∆Prob measures the change in the probability of CEO turnover per unit change in the relevant explanatory variables. For indicator variables,
the coefficient represents the change in the probability associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1. Models are estimated with robust standard errors to control for
heteroskedasticity. CEO age dummy equals 1 if lagged CEO age is greater than or equal to 60 and zero otherwise. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and
