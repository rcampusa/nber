     Ever since Stigler's seninal piece on the econcinics of information, a
great deal of research has been done investigatirg equilibrium in markets

with theoretically establishin the conlitions urer which there exists a

empirical   research in this area.
     This work has followed the sestion of Stigler ard utilized the
dispersion of prices (usually the variance) as a measure of ignorance about
price. There are two disadvantages to usir the variance (or another measure
of dispersion, such as the range) of prices as a measure of ignorance abcut
price. The first  reason, recognized by Stigler ard others,        is that
                                                                    price can
vary for many reasons other than ignorance. Thus dispersion     notis        a pire
measure of ignorance   about prices. The seconl reason,     which has not been

        this paper we propose a methed for measuring ignorance about price in
a market which builds on Stigler's original sugestion to use dispersion as a
measure of ignorance. The innovation is to use a new frontier estiiation
technique containing a three ccaiiponent error term to separate thserved price
dispersion into pirely rathcm variation, variation due to buyer ignorance,
ard variation due to seller ignorance . We açply the technique to the

I.    INTRODUCTION



A.    Background

      Ever since Stigler's (1961) seminal piece on the economics of

information, there has been a great deal of research investigating equilibrium

in markets with imperfect information. While most of this research has been

concerned with theoretically establishing the conditions under which there

exists a distribution of prices in equilibrium, there is a small, but growing,

body of empirical research in this area.

      This work has followed the suggestion of Stigler and utilized the

dispersion of prices (usually the variance) as a measure of ignorance about

price (see e.g., Stigler, 1961; Stigler and Kindahi, 1970; Pratt, Wise, and

Zeckhauser, 1979; Carlson and Pescatrice, 1980; Marvel, 1976; Mathewson, 1983;

Cox, DeSerpa, and Canby, 1982; Dahiby and West, 1986; and Van Hoommissen,

1988). There are two disadvantages to using the variance (or another measure

of dispersion, such as the range) of prices as a measure of ignorance about

price. The first reason, recognized by Stigler and others, is that price can

vary for many reasons other than ignorance. Thus dispersion is not a pure

measure of ignorance about prices. The second reason, which has not been

commonly recognized in the empirical literature, is that price dispersion can

occur due to Ignorance on the part of both buyers and of sellers (Rothschild,

 1974; Axell, 1977; Butters, 1977; Telser, 1978).

       In this paper we propose a method for measuring ignorance about price

 which builds on Stigler's original suggestion to use dispersion as a measure

 of ignorance. We use a generalized frontier estimation technique (Polachek

 and Yoon, 1987) to separate observed price dispersion into purely random

 variation, variation due to buyer ignorance, and variation due to seller
ignorance, and apply it to the physicians' services market. This yields price

ignorance indices for different services and illustrates how ignorance levels

vary by buyer, seller, and market area characteristics.

       We define buyer ignorance as the difference between the lowest price at

which the product is offered and the price which the consumer pays. This is

the money cost to the consumer of ignorance about price. Analogously, seller

ignorance is the difference between the highest price at which the product

could be sold and the price the seller accepts for the product. Seller

ignorance is the seller's money cost of ignorance about price. Thus, these

measures provide money metrics for the amount of buyer and seller information

in a market.



B. The Market For Physician Services

      The health care market in general, but especially the physicians'

services market, is commonly viewed as one in which market forces fail to work

effectively (e.g., Arrow, 1963; Newhouse, 1978; Pauly, 1978; Pauly, 1986).

Consumer price ignorance (i.e., lack of consumer information about price) has

been viewed as an important reason for this market failure (Cantwell, 1981;

Folland, 1985).' If consumer ignorance is substantial, policies failing to

address this problem will not prove effective in strengthening the role of

market forces (Marquis    j. 1985; Varner and Christy, 1986).

      Despite universal agreement that information deficiencies are important

causes of failure in the physician services market, there are no direct




         The Supreme Court viewed this as of enough importance to uphold an
FTC ruling forcing the AMA to drop member restrictions on advertising (Federal
Reporter, 1980).

                                       2
estimates of the extent of consumer ignorance in this market.2 This is not

surprising, given that information is difficult to observe and quantify.

Pauly (1978, 1986) points out that, while consumer information is perhaps the

most important feature of the health services marketplace, nearly absolute

consumer ignorance has been accepted as fact with very little empirical

evidence.

         The existing empirical work examines the link between information and

the price level.3 These studies attribute higher prices to consumer

ignorance, using advertising or other variables as proxies for information.

As Pauly (1978, 1986) indicates, consumer ignorance alone is not sufficient to

reduce consumer welfare relative to the full information equilibrium. An

informational asymmetry favoring the seller must also be present for ignorance

to present a problem in the aggregate. This study devises a way to measure

price ignorance as well as disentangle buyer and seller ignorance so that one

can make such inferences.

         In the rest of the paper we describe the theoretical and econometric

models (sections II and III, respectively), generate hypotheses (section IV),

discuss the data sources and the variables employed (section V) and present

the empirical results (section VI). Section VII contains a summary and

conclusions.




     2 Newhouse and Sloan (1972), Hsiao (1980), Marquis et al. (1985), and
White-Means (1989) have documented the dispersion in physician fees.
Beazoglou and Heffley (1987) have done the same for dentists.

         E.g., studies relating advertising bans to eyeglass and retail drug prices
(Benham, 1972; Cady, 1976; Feldman and Begun, 1978; Kwoka, 1984) and a study
relating proxies for search costs to physician fees (Pauly and Satterthwaite,
1981).

                                          3
II.    THE MODEL

       The approach taken here is based on results from the extensive

literature on search theory. Price dispersion is possible in an otherwise

competitive market if informational imperfections are present. For instance,

buyers are motivated to purchase the product for the lowest possible price.

They know the distribution of prices in the market, but not the price charged

by any given seller. Buyers choose an optimal amount of search based on a

weighing of the expected savings from search versus its associated costs.

Since buyers do not have perfect information, on average they will pay more

than the lowest price at which the product is offered for sale.4 We define

the gap between the lowest possible acceptance price and the price the

consumer pays as consumer ignorance. This is a measure of the pecuniary cost

to the consumer of his ignorance about price.5

      Seller ignorance is defined in the same manner. The seller seeks to

sell his product at the highest possible price. The seller also knows the

distribution of prices, but does not know any given price.6 Since sellers do

not have perfect information they will, on average, receive less than the

highest price at which the product is offered.7 The difference between the




     ' Some ignorant buyers may serendipitously stumble on the lowest priced
seller and will thus not incur any cost due to their ignorance. This is,
however, a cost to the seller due to his ignorance.

       This ignorance is optimal from the individual's viewpoint, given the
expected costs and benefits of search.
     6 Telser (1978) explicitly models search on the part of sellers.
Rothschild (1974), Axell (1977), Butters (1977), and Burdett and Judd (1983)
assume that sellers know their demand functions in only a probabilistic sense.

       Some ignorant sellers will randomly receive the highest price, but some
will not, thus the average will be below the maximum.

                                       4
price received and the highest price at which the product is sold is defined

as seller ignorance.5 This is the pecuniary cost to the seller of price

ignorance.

      Let there exist an equilibrium distribution of prices G(P), where



       P     f(Z, j).                                             (1)




The function f describes price as a function of demand and supply shifters

such as income and factor prices (Z), and of ignorance (ii), where ignorance is

defined as buyer ignorance relative to seller ignorance. If buyers are

relatively more Ignorant than sellers (on average), then E() is positive, and

vice versa. Rewriting (1) in the notation of a regression model, one obtains



       P O'Z+i.                                                    (2)




Since not all of the elements of z will generally be observable, the

expression for price is



       P—$'X+u+ii,                                                  (3)




where u is a purely random error consisting of the unobservable elements of Z

plus other stochastic factors and x consists of the observable elements of Z.

Hence, u is assumed two-sided with E(u)O, and u and X are assumed orthogonal.

 Since X is a sub-matrix of Z, the parameter vector   consists of the relevant



      8 This ignorance is optimal, as it is for buyers, given the expected
 benefits and costs of search.

                                        5
elements of 0 from equation (2).                 In addition, the ignorance parameter         can

be separated into its constituent components of buyer ignorance (w) and seller

ignorance (v), so that the complete model may be written as



        P 'X+u+v+w.                                                                    (4)




We now turn to the econometric specification of the model.



III.    ECONOMETRICS



        Consider equation (4). Let the price observed for observation i,
                                                                                             P1
be determined by a vector X, a parameter vector $,                     ignorance,   i7, and random
noise. Then           can be written as



           =
               fl'X   +   £, i   = 1, 2, . .     ., n                                  (5)



where     is an error term such that



               u +          u1
                                 +   v   +   w                                         (6)




and where the density of u1 has support                       the density of v has support
(-, 0], and the density of w1 has support [0,).

        Equations (5) and (6) represent a three-error component model which

allows for both systematically positive and negative error components in

addition to the usual random error component.
                                                             U1   is   a symmetric, purely

random, error, and v1 and w1 are systematically negative and positive errors,


                                                    6
representing seller and buyer ignorance, respectively.

       The interpretation of v and w as measures of ignorance implies

one-sided errors of differing signs such that E(v)=               < 0 and E(w) .         > 0.
As explained in Section p represents the average difference between the

price received by sellers and the highest price at which the good is sold,

thus , is negative.            can then be interpreted as seller ignorance.

represents the average difference between the actual sale price and the lowest

price at which the good is sold, and hence can be interpreted as buyer

ignorance. Thus, ji.,     is   positive.

       To obtain a form suitable for estimation which allows the

identification of the one-sided error components v1 and w1, assume that u1 has

a normal distribution with mean and variance (0, a2); that v1 is

exponentially distributed with mean and variance                  a2),   and that w has an

exponential distribution with mean and variance (jz.,,        a2).9      In addition, for

tractability, assume u, v1 and w are independent.

        Following Yoon and Polachek (1987), the marginal density of                is


(suppressing the subscript i)



        g(c) —       1   .

                 • exp(.(Z. +

         These specific distributional assumptions are not required, but v and
 w1 must be distributed differently from u over their ranges in order to achieve
 identi ficati on.

IV.   HYPOTHESES

      The econometric method described in the preceding section allows us to

identify and estimate the terms associated with buyer and seller ignorance.

To complete the model we consider some established hypotheses from search

theory. For example, it is well known that the net benefits of search are

less, and hence consumer ignorance is greater, for: goods which are cheaper,

goods which are purchased infrequently (Pratt, Wise, and Zeckhauser, 1979),

and (for health care) more heavily insured services, and treatments associated

with more severe illnesses (Newhouse, 1978; Dionne, 1984; Marquis, 1985).

      We therefore estimate the model using the prices of eight different

physician services as a means of testing these hypotheses. The services are:

office visits to any physician; office visits to general practitioners

(G.P.'s); office visits to pediatricians; office visits to general surgeons;

hospital follow-up visits, dilation and curettage (D&C) by obstetricians;

blood counts; and chest x-rays. We expect the information gap between buyers

and sellers to be smaller for office visits than for hospital follow-up

visits, D&C's, blood counts, or chest x-rays. Hospital care and D&C's are

purchased less frequently than office visits, are associated with more severe

illness, and are more heavily insured. Blood counts and chest x-rays are not

necessarily infrequent nor associated with severe illness, but both are

generally fully covered by insurance. In addition, hospital follow-up visits

and blood counts and chest x-rays are usually tied to the purchase of another

service, e.g., a hospital inpatient stay in the case of hospital follow-up

visits. Similarly, the ignorance of buyers relative to sellers is expected to

be larger for office visits to general surgeons than for office visits to

G.P.'s or pediatricians, since the services of the former are purchased less


                                       9
frequently and are associated with more severe illness.

        We also hypothesize that patients who are referred from another

physician substitute the referral for search, and are thus more ignorant. To

test this, we stratify physicians into those who have a high proportion of

their practice from referrals and those who have a low proportion from

referrals. The magnitude of buyer relative to seller ignorance should be

greater for the high referral stratum than for the low referral stratum.

         Last, we hypothesize that the opportunity cost of search is higher for

both patients and physicians with higher incomes. Thus, the measures of both

buyer and seller ignorance should be higher in areas with high per capita

income than with low per capita income.

Government. The bulk of the data set is composed of surveys conducted by

Mathematica from March to June of 1978, although some secondary data sources

have been included. The final sample included 957 groups and 6353 physicians

practicing In those groups. Five medical practice specialties were sampled:



        10
             Since not all physicians practice in groups, the data are not
necessarily representative of the physician services market, consequently the
empirical results in this paper should be regarded as illustrative.

                                                   10
general practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, and

obstetrics/gynecology. Approximately 60 percent of all office-based

physicians practice in these specialties.

      This data set also includes data measuring characteristics of the area

in which the group practiced as well as data on the hospital with which the

group is affiliated. The area characteristics data were obtained from many

sources, including the American Medical Association, and The County and City

Data Book. For a full listing of all these data sources see Boldin, Carcagno,

Held, Jamieson, and Woolridge (1979). The hospital data were obtained from

the American Hospital Association Guide for 1978.



B.     Variables

       We estimated the three-error component model of the price function

(equation (4)). Eight different prices were used as dependent variables: the

usual fee for an office visit for all physicians, the usual fee for an office

visit for general practitioners, the usual fee for an office visit for

pediatricians, the usual fee for an office visit for general surgeons, the fee

for a hospital follow-up visit for all physicians, the fee for a dilation and

curettage (D&C) for obstetrician/gynecologists, the fee for a complete blood

 count, and the fee for a chest x-ray.11

       The independent variables represent exogenous factors affecting the

 demand and supply of physician services: measures of insurance coverage, fee

 collection, market area characteristics, input prices, and physician




          All money variables are deflated by the consumer price index (four
 person family, intermediate budget) for the county in which the physician is
 located.

                                           11
characteristics.12 The measures of insurance coverage are the proportion of

the physician's patients who are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and who have

no insurance coverage. The proportion covered by Medicare is expected to have

a positive impact on price, since Medicare provided generous reimbursement to

physicians in 1978. The proportion on Medicaid is expected to have a negative

effect on price, since Medicaid has been penurious in its reimbursement to

physicians. The proportion without insurance should also be negatively

related to price, since those without insurance pay the full cost of services

provided. Fee collection is measured by the proportion of bills collected by

the physician's practice. This provides a truer measure of the average

transaction price, and may also proxy for price discrimination, to the extent

that it is practiced by forgiving fees.'3

         Market area characteristics are per capita income, percent of the area

that is urban, percent of the population on AFDC, and median gross rent. The

first three variables are demand shifters controlling for income, population

density, and poverty. Median gross rent is a proxy for the price of office

space.

         The wage paid to registered nurses by the physician's practice is a

measure of the input price of labor.




      12 We considered employing a number of other variables which could be
hypothesized to determine price: patient waiting time, length of a follow-up
office visit, physicians per capita, number of physicians in the group, and
physician compensation method, but specification tests rejected the exogeneity
of these variables.

      13 For an interesting discussion of this point, see Lachs, Sindelar, and
Horwitz (1990).

                                        12
      Physician characteristics are: the experience of the physician, whether

they practice in a subspecialty, whether they are female, whether they

graduated from a foreign medical school, and the physician's specialty. The

physician's experience, whether they practice in a subspecialty, and whether

they are a foreign medical graduate are characteristics which may be

associated with quality or productivity differences. They may either

determine quality, and thus be valued indirectly, or they may be valued

directly by patients (as in an hedonic model, e.g., Goldman and Grossman,

1974). The physician's sex may also be directly valued by patients, or may be

related to productivity. Dummies for the physician's specialty were included

in regressions which pooled physicians across specialties. Table 1 lists the

definitions of these variables and Table 2 provides descriptive statistics.



VI. ESTIMATION RESULTS

       Table 3 reports the complete set of parameter estimates for all

physicians' fees. Tables 4 and 5 report the estimates of the ignorance

indices by the various services and strata. The estimation results are

striking. They reflect the common wisdom concerning information asymmetries.

For all the specifications, the patient ignorance estimates are greater than

the estimates of physician ignorance.'4 For example, in Table 3, the estimate

of patient Ignorance is 2.04 and of physician ignorance is 1.39. Thus, on




         As a preliminary test we examined the distribution of the OLS residuals
(c) to the price function. Since £ is the sum of a normally distributed random
variable and two exponentially distributed random variables, It is not normally
distributed. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a Jarque-Bera (Jarque and Bera, 1980)
test on the OLS residuals both rejected normality at the 1% confidence level.
In addition, the residuals were positively skewed.

                                       13
average, patients pay a premium of almost 15 percent due to their ignorance.

This is almost twice as great as the cost to physicians of their ignorance.

          The parameter estimates are consistent with prior expectations. We

report the parameter estimates for office visit fees pooling all physicians,

since they did not differ much for the various strata. Table 3 contains two

columns: one for the maximum likelihood estimates, and one containing least

squares estimates for purposes of comparison.15 Since the estimates are very

simiar, we only discuss the maximum likelihood estimates.

          The insurance variables are all significant and have the expected

effects. The proportion of patients with Medicare coverage is positively

related to price, and the proportion with Medicaid or no insurance have

negative effects on price. The percent of bills collected by the practice has

a negative, but insignificant, effect on the price charged. The negative sign

implies that price increases as the collection percent falls, a way of

compensating for lost revenue. This is also consistent with price

discrimination by means of bill forgiveness.

          The market area variables are mostly consistent with expectations. Per

capita income and percent urban both have positive and significant

coefficients. Median gross rent has an estimated positive effect on price, as

hypothesized, but is not statistically significant. A puzzling result is that

the percent of the population on AFOC has a positive and significant effect on




     15
           Since theory provides no guide to the functional form of the price
equation, we tested the validity of the two most common functional forms: linear
and logarithmic, using the E test of MacKinnon, White, and Davidson (1983). The
test failed to reject linearity, while the logarithmic form was rejected at the
1% level, therefore we employed the linear functional form.

                                          14
price, rather than the hypothesized negative one. Perhaps percent AFOC is

associated with omitted factors which have a positive effect on demand.

      Registered nurse wages have a positive effect on price. This is as

expected, since an increase in input prices will increase the marginal cost of

production.

      We hypothesized that physician experience would have a positive effect

on price through patients valuing experience or through greater efficiency in

producing quality. However, we find that experience of the physician has a

negative and significant impact on price. This is not consistent with the

hypothesis that experience represents quality, however it is consistent with a

hypothesis that experience is associated with productivity, thus translating

into lower price through decreased costs. Physicians who practice in a

subspecialty charge higher fees, consistent with the story that this

represents quality. Neither the physician's sex (whether they are female) nor

whether they are a foreign medical graduate has a significant effect on price.

Last, the physician specialty dummies are consistent with observed pricing

patterns: G.P.'s and pediatricians charge less than general surgeons, and

internists and obstetricians charge more.

      Table 4 contains the maximum likelihood estimates for each of the three

components of the error term for the seven other services: office visits by

G.P.'s, office visits by pediatricians, office visits by general surgeons,

hospital follow-up visits, D&C's by obstetricians, blood counts, and chest x-

rays. Patients are found to be more ignorant than doctors. The measure of

patient ignorance ranges from 5.212 for D&C's to 1.959 for pediatric office

visits, and the difference between patient and physician ignorance varies from

4.084 for D&C's to 1.24 for G.P. office visits. In addition, the measures of


                                       15
patient ignorance and the differences between patient and physician ignorance

are greater for those services which are purchased less frequently, associated

with greater severity of illness, or are more heavily insured. The largest

measures of patient ignorance, and the largest differences between the two

ignorance measures, are for D&C's and hospital follow-up visits. These are

both services which are purchased infrequently, are associated with greater

severity of illness, and are heavily insured. The smallest estimates of

patient ignorance and the smallest differences between patient and physician

ignorance are for office visits to G.P.'s and pediatricians. These services

are used relatively more frequently, are associated with lesser severity of

illness, and are lightly insured. Intermediate values of these measures are

found for blood counts and chest x-rays, services which are heavily insured,

but are not purchased frequently and are not associated with severe illness.

These findings, combined with the findings from Table 3, provide strong

empirical support for the notion that information, and especially asymmetry in

information, plays an important role in price determination in this market.

      We also hypothesized that the proportion of a physician's practice

drawn from referrals and per capita income in the market area are related to

the cost of search. Referrals substitute for patient search. Since patients

are searching less, they will pay a higher price. Physicians also likely know

more about referred patients. Consequently, we expect the estimate of patient

ignorance to be higher and the estimate of physician ignorance to be lower for

physicians in the subsample with high referral practices. This is precisely

the case. Examining the estimates in Table 5, the measure of patient

ignorance is 2.361 when the percent of practice from referrals is 0-3%, and

2.855 when referrals make up 20% or more of the physician's practice.


                                       16
Physician ignorance is estimated to be 1.765 for the low referral subsample,

and 1.169 for the high referral physicians.    Even more telling is the

difference between patient and physician ignorance estimates for the two

subsamples. The gap equals 0.6 for the low referral subsample and is equal to

1.69, or almost triple that, for the high referral subsample.

      Per capita income is positively related to the opportunity cost of

time, therefore search should be more costly (on average) in high than in low

per capita income areas. This should be true both for patients and

physicians. Thus, the estimates of both patient and physician ignorance

should be higher in areas where the per capita income is higher. This is

indeed the case. Again, using the estimates for office visit price for all

physicians, we see that the estimate of patient ignorance is 2.839 where per

capita income is $5,567 or greater, and 2.031 where per capita income is

$4,455 or lower. Physician ignorance is estimated as 1.989 for the high per

capita income subsample, and 0.711 for the low per capita income subsample.

       Both of these results are consistent with hypotheses about how these

variables affect search costs. They provide further support for interpreting

the one-sided residual estimates components as measures of ignorance.

       One problem with these as well as Stigler type ignorance estimates is

that they are not based on actual measures of information, but are inferred

from price data alone. Given that, it is useful to question the

interpretation of the results as measuring ignorance. In particular, there

are undoubtedly unmeasured quality differences which are captured in the total

residual, c. Recall that the measures of ignorance are essentially estimates

of the dispersion in price. Therefore quality differences can only account

for the observed pattern of the ignorance measures across the various


                                       17
strata if the dispersion in quality is greater for those strata with greater

measured patient ignorance. Consider the findings for the patient referral

strata. It could be argued that the larger measure of patient ignorance for

the high referral stratum actually reflects the fact that higher quality

physicians receive more referrals. Since the measure of patient ignorance is

an estimate of dispersion, however, for this to be true there must not only be

greater quality among high referral physicians, but greater dispersion in

quality. There is no obvious reason to believe this is true. Of course, the

overwhelming number of estimates following the same pattern of asymmetry

between patient and physician provide evidence in favor of interpreting these

estimates as measures of information.



VII.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

       In this paper a new method for measuring ignorance is proposed which

extends the Stiglerian measure of price ignorance. This method controls for

the effects of supply and demand on price and uses a new econometric method to

separate price dispersion into measures of buyer ignorance, seller ignorance,

and random noise.

       The method is applied to data from the market for physician services, a

market which is commonly thought of as being characterized by ignorance about

price. The empirical results accord with intuition: the measure of patient

ignorance exceeds the measure of physician ignorance by approximately a factor

f two. Patient Ignorance is also measured as being relatively larger than

physician ignorance for smaller ticket items, less frequently purchased items,

more heavily insured items, and treatments associated with severe illness, as

has been hypothesized. Last, measured ignorance is higher when proxies for


                                        18
search costs are higher. These results are striking and suggest that this

method has promise in obtaining estimates of money metrics for price

ignorance.

      This does not necessarily imply large welfare gains from informing

consumers about price, however. First, gains are only possible if some public

or market institution could gather and disseminate this information more

cheaply than individuals. Second, due to the numerous imperfections in the

physicians services market, it is not obvious what the welfare effects of

correcting only one of these imperfections would be.
