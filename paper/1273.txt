        The Behavior of U.S. Short—Term Interest Rates Since October 1979



                                    ABSTRACT



         Short-term interest rates in the United States have been "too high" since

October 1979 in the sense that both unconditional and      conditional   forecasts, based

on an estimated vector autoregression model summarizing the prior experience,

underpredict short-term interest rates during this period. Although a non-
structural model cannot directly answer the question of why this has been so,
comparisons   of alternative conditional forecasts point to the post—October 1979
relationship   between the growth of real income and the growth of real money

balances as closely connected to the level and pattern of short—term interest

rates. This finding is consistent with the authors' earlier conclusion, based

on   analysis of a small structural Inacroeconometric   model, that the high average

level   of interest rates has been due to a combination of slow growth of (nominal)
money supply and continuing price inflation, which together have kept real balances
small in relation to prevailing levels of economic activity.

            THE BEHAVIOR OF U.S. SHORT-TERN INTEREST RATES SINCE OCTOBER 1979




            Just about   all aspects of   interest rates in the United States —     including
their   overall levels, their movements, and their relationships to one another —

have been extraordinary thus far during the 1980s. Observed nominal interest

rates on most instruments traded in the U.S. debt markets have set record

highs twice since 1980. The amplitude of interest rate swings over the economy's

one—and—a-half business cycles has also been unprecedented in U.S. experience,

and   the   shorter-run volatility of interest rates (month-to-month, day-to—day,

or   even within the trading day) has increased dramatically. The term—structure
"yield curve" was sharply "inverted" during part of this time, although it is no
longer, and other yield comparisons (on taxable versus tax—exempt bonds, for
example) were and have remained far from their historical          norms.

            The single aspect of interest rates that has attracted the most attention

during this period has been their persistently high level, including a presumed

high level of "real" interest rates —that is, observed nominal rates less

some presumed expectation of price inflation. During the past few years,

nominal interest rates first rose to levels far above the prevailing inflation

rate, and more recently the decline in nominal interest rates has lagged well

behind the slackening of the pace of inflation.

            For two reasons the greatest attention, and also the greatest puzzlement,

have focused on the high level of short-term         interest   rates. First, because

inferring market participants' expectations of inflation is typically more

difficult as the relevant time horizon is longer, the judgment that interest

rates have been unusually       high   in real terms has been much safer for short than

for long maturities. Given the state of and prospects for business activity,
the normal cyclical slowing of inflation since 1980         was   probably widely
                                           —2—




anticipated. By contrast, who is prepared to say what market participants

thought (or think) about the outlook for inflation over the life of a thirty-

year bond?

          Second, many of the familiar hypotheses advanced to explain the presund

high real interest rate levels have made sense only for longer maturities.

Fear   that the Federal Reserve System would abandon its anti-inflationary monetary
policy, for example, may have      affected expectations about the likely rate of

inflation    in subsequent years, but not over three-month horizons. Why,   then,

would three-month interest rates have reflected it? The concern that the Reagan
Administration's fiscal policy, combining massive tax cuts with rapidly
increasing    military spending, would require high enough real interest rates to

"crowd out" large amounts of private investment is plausible enough — but only

after the economy had recovered from the 1981-82 recession, which involved the

excess private saving also usually associated with weak economic activity.

This concern would not have affected short-term yields either, at least during

the period to 1983. The idea that increased interest rate and asset price

volatility in the financial markets has led to higher risk premia is quite

plausible too, but it again applies only to 1ongterm instruments, subject to

substantial capital risk. If anything, the effect of greater volatility should

be to increase the demand for short—term instruments, and hence to reduce the i

yields.

          Nevertheless,   U.S. short-term interest rates certainly have been high in
the recent past, in both nominal and real terms. From 1953 through the third
quarter of 1979 — a familiar break point in recent analysis of U.S. monetary
policy —the average discount on three-month U.S. Treasury bills was 5.27%.
The subsequent average (to midyear 1983)     has been 11.67%. For the corresponding
real   rate, representing the difference between this nominal rate and the
                                           —3—




annualized percentage change in the gross national product deflator, the analogous

comparison is 1.39% versus 4.71%. During the earlier twenty-six years the

maximum nominal rate observed in any quarter was 9.06% (in 1979:3), while the

maximum real rate was 3.24% (in 1953:4) — in both cases below the corresponding

recent means. Since October 1979, the nominal rate in every quarter but one has

been at least 6% above the corresponding 195 3-79 mean. With few exceptions, the

real rate since then has also consistently been well above the corresponding

1953—79 mean.

         In an earlier paper, the authors (1983) used a small structural econometric

model to address two questions: Have U.S. short-term interest rates been "too

high,"   given the relevant historical     relationships connecting interest rates and

other key aspects of macroeconomic activity? nd if so, then why? The basic

strategy employed in that paper was to analyze the errors made in forecasting

short—term interest rates for 1979:4-1983:2, using a model estimated with data

through 1979:3, and to compare them with the analogous errors made for 1976:3-

1979;3 using the same model estimated only with data through 1976:2.1 The

conclusions   of that   analysis were that U.S. short—term interest rates since

October   1979 have indeed been "too high" in a meaningful sense, and that the
familiar story of too little money for the prevailing levels of economic activity
— in particulars the small growth of real balances due to the combination of
slow growth of nominal money     supply and sluggish deceleration of price inflation

   largely    accounts for this phenomenon.
         The object   of this paper is to re-examine the same questions using a

different   set of empirical tools •   A   structural model like that used in the
authors' earlier paper imposes potentially important restrictions o       the way in

which the estimated model summarizes the relationships exhibited by prior

expeience       1ny analysis   based on a structural model is therefore conditional
                                          —4-


on those restrictions. Restrictions that are ylid reflections of actual

economic   behavior will enable the model to extract the relevant behavioral
relationships more   efficiently from the available data, but incorrect or

arbitrary restrictions will distort the representation of these relationships.

2n   alternative enirical strategy, developed primarily by Sims (1980a, 1980b,
1982), is to forego structural restrictions altogether —that is, apart from
the choice of the variables to be included in the analysis — and instead to
irk with unrestricted dynamic representations of the data.
         The exercise   reported in this paper uses a small vector autoregression

representation of the relationships among key macroeconomic variables in the

United States to study the same 1979:4—1983:2 behavior of short-term interest

rates examined in the authors' earlier paper. Here again, the ability to forecast

interest rates during this period, using a model estimated with data ending in

1979:3, sheds light on the question of whether rates have been "too high." To

anticipate, the answer is again yes. Without a structural model, the analysis

cannot directly address the question of why this has been so. Nevertheless,

further experiments based on a conditional forecasting technique suggested by

Doan et al. (1983) indicate results consistent with the authors' earlier finding

that the scarcity of real balances in relation to prevailing levels of economic

activity has been an inportant element in the U.S. interest rate experience since

October 1979. In short, the results of the vector autoregression analysis

reported here correspond well with the main conclusions based on the structural

model.

         Section I summarizes the vector autoregression model and presents the

model's (unconditional) forecast of U.S. short—term interest rates during 1979:4-

19832. Section II briefly describes the conditional forecasting technique and

presents results indicating that no single variable — neither money, the

government deficit, nor any of the other variables included in the analysis
                                               —5—




 is sufficient to account for the experience of short-term interest rates during
 this period.     Sections III and IV present further conditional forecasting

results, including especially those involving the relationship between real

money balances and real economic activity. Section V briefly summarizes the

paper's principal conclusions.


I.    The Vector Autoregressive Model and        Its   Unconditional Projections

          The analysis below uses a constant—coefficient, linear vector autoregression

model    to estimate the pre-October 1979 probability structure of          the quarterly

data for six key U.S. macroeconomic variables: the growth rate of the narrowly

defined money stock (Ml), the growth rate of total nonfinancial credit, the change

in the federal budget deficit, the growth rate of real gross national product,

the  rate of change of the grOss national product deflator, and the change in
the three-month Treasury bill rate. 2 The model can be written as
                                =     + -t-s
                                           5

                                           s=l
                                                             +


where z is   the vector of six variables specific         above, a is a vector of   constants,
the B(s) are time—invariant     matrices   of autoregression coefficients, and           is
a vector of     independent and identically distributed innovations. Table I reports

the   results of estimating this system for quarterly data spanning 1962:3-1979:3.
Over the sample, money growth "Granger—caused" short—term interest rate changes,
but not real income growth. By contrast, both credit growth and interest rate
changes   did   "Granger—cause" real income growth.3 correlations among the in-
sample innovations (not shown in the table) indicate             that the surprises in income

growth   and in   interest rates were positively correlated, while surprises        in
money growth and in inflation were    both negatively correlated with interest rate

surprises.
                                        —6—




         Given the dynamic correlations among the macroeconomic variables

summarized by the estimated vector autoregression, it is straightforward to

construct a post—October 1979 path that is most likely, in the absence of

further information, for any of the model's variables. In particular, obtaining

the best linear projection of the post-sample values attained by the variables

in each of the fifteen quarters 1979:4-1983:2 simply requires recursively

forecasting one step ahead at a time with the autoregressive equations,

using the successively forecast values of the variables as the data of the system.

          Coluinn (1) and (2) of Table II conare this projection for the short—

term interest rate with the corresponding actual values. The forecast fails

to capture any of the variation in short—term interest rates that has attracted

so much attention during this period. The mean error of —.62% — that is, an

underprediction of short—term interest rates on average — results from a larger

underprediction during 1980 and 1981 combined with a substantial overprediction

in late 1982 and 1983. The root-mean-square error is 2.38%.

          nalogous comparisons for the system' s other five variables, shown in
summary form    in Table III confirm several familiar conjectures about the post—
October 1979 macroeconomic experience. Over the twelve quarters    1979:4—1982:3,

for    example, money growth was consistently slower (while the short—term interest
rate   was consistently higher) than projected. For the seven quarters 1981:4-

1983:2, both income growth and inflation were also consistently slower than

projected. Nonetheless, money growth was substantially faster (and the interest

rate lower) than projected for the more recent quarters 1982:4—1983:2. For the

eight quarters immediately following October 1979, both income growth and

inflation were roughly as projected by the model.

II. Conditional Forecasting with the Vector Autoregression Model

          The next step of the analysis is to construct and study the best linear

projections of one element of z (the short-term interest rate) given            knowledge
of the history of z     up to   October 1979   and in   addition knowledge of various

(linear      combinations of) elements of z during the post-October 1979 period being
forecast. In other words, the object is to construct forecasts of the short-
term interest rate in each post-October 1979 quarter that will incorporate
knowledge of (linear combinations of) other elements of z in all post-October
1979 quarters through the end of the forecast period. Recent work by Sims (1982)
and   Doan   et al. (1983) has introduced and successfully      employed such conditional

projections     to evaluate the plausibility of macroeconometric forecasts in light
of   the historical dynamic correlations among the variables being predicted.

         The basis for constructing these constrained projections is the method of

Kalman filtering. Clarida and Coyle (1983) have shown that Kalman filtering may

be   applied to any state space model which. combines post—sample observations on a

linear combination of a system's variables with that system's historically

estimated parameters to yield minimum mean—square linear estimates which

optimally incorporate the post-'sample observations. They have also established

a particularly simple relationship between the unconditional projection of z

in the s'th post-sample quarter, say,                and the projection Iwhich

incorporates a vector of post-sample observations, , on linear combinations of

the elements of z:


                                 l=            + K(-?).
In words, the difference between the ôonditional and unconditional projection
for z is then just a linear transformation of the difference between the
observed vector       and its best linear projection .        The   associated transformation
                                             —8—




matrix K can      be   computed directly, and at reasonable cost, from the parameter

and variance—covariance matrices of the estimated vector autoregression.

            Columns (3)-(7) of Table II show the results of using the model described

in Section I to generate successive dynamic forecasts of U.S. short—term interest

rates that are each conditional on one variable among the five (other than the

interest rate itself) included in the vector autoregression system. For each

successive conditioning variable, the relevant column reports the fifteen

quarter-by—quarter forecast values, together with the same summary          statistics
shown in column (2) for the unconditional forecast.

        What is immediately striking in this set of results is that, with the

single exception of the forecast conditional on the price variable, none of

these conditional       forecasts represents an    improvement over the unconditional

forecast     discussed   in Section I. The forecast conditional on money growth is by

far   the   worst among the five, as the model not only fails tQ capture much of

the movement to unusually high short-term interest rates in 1980 and 1981 but

also incorrectly infers that the speed-up of money growth in 1982 and early

1983 would have led rates to drop to levels last seen in the l950s. Both           the
root—mean—square error and the mean absolute error are much larger than those of

the   unconditional forecast. The forecast conditional on credit growth is
roughly     similar overall, although less extremely off track than that conditional
on money growth. At least in this context, knowing either money growth (only)
or credit growth (only) would have been less useful than knowing nothing at all.
            The forecast   conditional on the deficit change captures the high average
short-term      interest rate level in 1980 and 1981 with fair accuracy — except for

the immediate post-credit-controls (and post-recession) dip in 1980:3, of.

course — but it fails to capture the sharp drop in rates that occurred once the

stance of monetary policy shifted in late 1982. As a result, this forecast
                                            —9--




 overpredicts short—term interest rates on average during 1979 :3—1983 :2, in
 contrast   to the average underprediction made by the unconditional forecast

 or the forecast conditional on either money or credit growth. The mean error

 here is somewhat smaller (in absolute value) than that of the unconditional

 forecast, but the root—mean-square error is larger.

          Although the summary statistics for the forecast conditional on real

 income growth and that conditional on the deficit change are almost identical,

the quarter-by—quarter forecast values show large dissimilarities.        The forecast
 conditional    on real growth underpredicts short—term interest rates on average in

1980 and 1981, but then entirely misses the sharp drop that accompanied the end

of the 1981-82 recession and the beginning of the business recovery. The overall

result is again overprediction (by the smallest mean absolute error among the

five    forecasts   considered here), and again a root-mean-square error even larger
than that of the unconditional forecast.

         The   forecast   conditional on price inflation is the only one among the five

to improve unambiguously on the unconditional forecast. The quarter-by—quarter
pattern of this forecast is similar to that of the forecast conditional on the
deficit change. The forecast conditional on inflation also captures reasonably
well the high average level of short-term interest rates in 1980 and 1981 (again,
except   for 1980:3), and it also fails to capture the drop in rates at the end

of 1982. Its mean overprediction is somewhat larger than that of the forecast

conditional on the deficit change (it is almost as large as the mean absolute

error of the unconditional forecast), but the associated root-mean—square error

is   smaller than that of any of the other forecasts considered thus far.
         On the whole, these dynamic interest rate forecasts conditional on single
other   variables are not encouraging, They suggest that (with the limited possible

exception of inflation) no one macroeconomic variable can tell much of the story
                                       —10—




of   why short-term interest rates moved as they did during this period.


III. Richer Conditional Forecasts: The Role of Real Balances

         As the discussion in Section II explains, the conditional forecasting

technique suggested by Doan et al. facilitates using an estimated vector

autoregression model not only to generate forecasts conditional on one single

variable but also forecasts conditional on several variables or on the sums or

differences (more generally, any linear combination) of several variables.

In light of the limited success of the short—term interest rate forecasts

conditional only on single variables, it is worthwhile to experiment with forecasts

conditional on richer information sets. Even so, simply trying in succession all

possible combinations among the five other variables included in the vector

autoregression hardly makes sense. The approach taken here is instead to

focus on a few specific combinations suggested by the authors' previous work,

based on a structural model, which concluded that the high level of U.S. short-

term interest rates since October 1979 has principally reflected the relationship

between real money balances and real economic activity.

        Column (3) of Table II already indicates the limited value, from the

perspective of the vector autoregression's forecast of short-term interest

rates during this period, of the information contained in the growth rate of real

incon. Column (8) shows a similar result for the growth rate of real money

balances, represented in the model   by the difference between the (nominal) money
growth rate variable and the price inflation variable. The forecast conditional
on real money growth underpredicts short—term interest rates, although with a

small mean absolute error. Its root—mean—square error, however, is larger than

that of the unconditional forecast, In short, neither real income growth nor real

money growth (and certainly not nominal money growth) successfully helps the model
                                              —11—




 to   predict short-term interest rates during this period.
           By contrast, the two together do just          that.   Column (9)    shows the results
 of           of short—term interest rates conditional on both real income growth
      a forecast

 and real money growth. This forecast underpredicts part of the high average
 interest    rate level in   1980 and 1981,   and    it   does not adequately capture the

 decline in late 1982. On balance it underpredicts short-term interest rates, with

a mean absolute error less than half that of the unconditional forecast. More

            the root—mean-square error is substantially smaller than that of the
 importantly,

unconditional forecast (and also smaller than that of the forecast conditional
on the inflation rate).

           This   result, like any finding based on a non-structural model, cannot by
itself lead to any conclusions about what has "causedt' the high interest rate
levels prevailing in the United States since October 1979. It simply relates
interest rates to specific macroeconomic variables — in particular, real balances
and real income         and not to elements of macroeconomic behavior like money demand
and money supply. Nevertheless, the apparent value in this context of the
information contained jointly in real money growth and real income growth is
consistent with the authors' earlier explanation (based on a structural model)
that the slow growth of nominal money supply and the continuing rapid price
inflation combined to render the supply of real money balances small in comparison
with   the real money demand associated with the prevailing levels of real activity..4

To put the point the other way around, the. alternative finding                that real money
growth   and real income growth jointly contained little information that helped

the model to forecast short—term interest rates would have cast doubt on the

authors'    earlier explanation. Instead      of such a negative result, however, the

opposite    is a better description.
         Given this result, it is interesting to determine whether the information
                                            —12—




that matters for the model's forecast of short—term interest rates involves

real income growth and real money growth separately, or only their difference

—that is, the growth of velocity. An analogous forecast conditional on

velocity growth (not shown in the table) results in a mean error of .37% and a

root—mean—square error of 2.09%, inferior to the forecast conditional on real

income growth and real money growth separately, but superior to any of the

other forecasts considered.5 In other words, imposing the restriction

represented by combining real income growth. and real money growth into velocity

growth causes a loss of some, but far from all, of the relevant information

contained in these two variables.

          Before drawing any    firm conclusions   on the basis of the superior

performance       of the short—term interest rate forecast conditional on real income
growth and real money growth (or, to a lesser extent, the forecast conditional
on velocity growth), it is useful to learn whether the same relative success is
also    associated with forecasts conditional on other combinations of variables.

Once again, simply trying all possible      combinations of   conditioning variables

makes    little   sense. Nevertheless, two further projections of the short—term

interest   rate (not shown in the table) eaôh conditional on an information set
intuitively   corresponding to familiar discussions about recent interest rate

levels   — real income growth and real credit growth, and (nominal) money growth
and the deficit change .— generate results that are less satisfactory than even
the unconditional projection shown in column (2).
         The relationship between the growth of real income and the growth of real
balances   does    stand outf therefore, as apparently bearing a close connection to
the   recent experience of short—term interest rates. The information contained

in these variables improves the model's short—term interest rate forecast in

comparison to the corresponding unconditional forecast, in comparison to forecasts
                                              —1 3—




conditional on single variables (including real income growth or real money
growth separately), and in comparison to forecasts conditional on other
combinations of variables.

IV. Forecasts Conditional on the Full Information Set
          The results    presented   in Sections II and III focus on projections of the

most likely post.-October 1979 path for U.S. short-term interest rates which

incorporate       information about various other aspects of the contemporaneous
macroeconomic experience. The results indicate that the unprecedented behavior
of short—term rates throughout this period is consistent with some features of
the recent macroeconomic experience (for exanle, the relationship between real
balances and real income), but not with others (for example, the respective
paths    of money and    the   deficit). Column (10) of Table II shows the projection

of   the most likely recent short-term interest rate path which simultaneously
incorporates information on the post-October 1979 behavior of all five of the
system's other variables: money growth,        credit growth, real income growth, price

inflation, and the deficit change.

          Given   the recent behavior and historical correlations among all of these
key macroeconomic variables,         the resulting projection substantially and

consistently underpredicts short-term interest rates throughout the period since
October 1979. The mean error is -2.74%, with underpredctions in eleven of the
fifteen quarters, (The only exceptions are 1980:3 and 1982:4-l983;2 episodes
already   highlighted above.) This "fully informed" projection does forecast short-

term    interest rates   that are quite high in relation to historical experience,

with    a forecast mean of 8.92% versus comparable averages of 6.12% during the
l970s   and 3.45% from the end of the Korean War through the l96Os. Nevertheless,

the iulications of the "fully inorined" projection exercise is clear. The
                                            -14-




behavior of short—term interest rates since October 1979 does not appear to be

consistent with the relevant historical correlations and the recent macroeconomic

experience.


V. Summary of Conclusions

         Two questions motivated the analysis in this paper: Have U.S. short-

term interest rates been "too high," given the relevant historical relationships

connecting interest rates and other key aspects of macroeconomic activity? And

if so, then why?

         The   analysis here gives a yes answer to the first question. An estimated
model summarizing the prior experience predicts that short-term interest rates
would be   high on average after October 1979, but not so high as the average

level actually obtained. The model's unconditional forecast underpredicts

interest rates in the post—October 1979 period, and so does the corresponding

forecast conditional on all five     of   the other variables included.

         A non—structural model cannot directly answer the second question, but

comparisons among the conditional forecasting exercises reported here point to the

post-October 1979 relationship between the growth of real income and the growth

of   real money balances as closely connected to the pattern of short—term interest
rates during this period. This finding is consistent with the authors' earlier
conclusion,    based on   analysis of a small structural macroeconometric model,
that   the high average level of   interest rates has been due to a combination of
slow growth of     (nominal) money supply and continuing price inflation, which

together have kept real balances small in relation to prevailing levels of real

economic activity.

1. The cut-off at 1976 :2 represented the end of the sample used in the original

   presentation of the model in Friedman (1977).

2. The interest rate data are averages of daily observations for the first month

    of each quarter. The inflation data are contemporaneous with the interest

    rate data. Alternative ways of constructing the data —        for   example,

    aligning the interest rate and price change series differently or using

    quarterly average interest rate observations — apparently make little

    difference for the results reported here.

3. The "Granger causality from interest rates to output has been documented by

    Sims (1980b). "Granger causality" from credit to output is consistent with

    the findings of Friedman (1983).

4. The same story     can   be told in either real or nominal terms, of course,

    although   the   real version is presumably preferable unless the income

    elasticity of the demand for money is identical to the price elasticity. A

    forecast analogous to that reported in column (9), but conditional or

    nominal money and nominal income, results in mean error 1.19% and root—mean—

    square error 2,01%.

5. The root—mean—square error matches that of the forecast conditional on price

    inflation, but the mean error is smaller.
