                                          ABSTRACT

In recent years, some English critics have claimed that Damien Hirst and his fellow young British
artists have made London the new center of the advanced art world. As Hirst reaches the age of 40,
this paper uses auction results to measure the importance of the YBAs compared to their American
peers. Auction prices show that the YBAs do rule over their American rivals: both Hirst and the
English painter Chris Ofili have had individual works sell for more than $1 million, a level no
American artist under 40 has achieved. Whether London can continue its success will depend in part
on whether it can match New York's ability to attract important artists born in other countries.

Introduction

               These Americans have had it all their own way for far too long.
                                           Damien Hirst, 19991

       As early as 1948, the American critic Clement Greenberg made the shocking declaration

that “the main premises of Western art have at last migrated to the United States,” and that New

York had replaced Paris as the center of the world of advanced art.2 During the early 1950s, the

growing recognition that Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and their fellow

Abstract Expressionists were the leading artistic innovators of their time led to a widespread

acceptance of Greenberg’s proposition among American observers.3 The subsequent revolution,

which began in the late 1950s, in which the experimental approach of the Abstract Expressionists

was overthrown by a series of conceptual innovations made by Jasper Johns, Robert

Rauschenberg, the Pop artists, and the Minimalists, was carried out entirely in New York, and

only served to emphasize the American dominance of the contemporary art world. By 1983, the

preeminence of New York was so obvious that even a French scholar, Serge Guilbaut, conceded

the point and wrote a monograph explaining How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art.4

       Within the past decade, however, a number of English critics have claimed that New

York has been displaced as the center of the advanced art world by London, as a result of the

achievements of the young British artists, or YBAs. The YBAs burst onto the art scene in 1988,

in Freeze, a group exhibition held in an empty warehouse in London’s Docklands. The show

was curated by Damien Hirst, who was then an art student at Goldsmiths’ College, and nearly all

the exhibitors were fellow students of Hirst’s.5 Freeze was soon followed by a series of similar

group exhibitions, and the artists involved, with some others of their generation, gained a
                                                  4

common identity as a new movement in art. The label for the group was cemented by a series of

shows presented by the collector and dealer Charles Saatchi, beginning in 1992, titled Young

British Artists.6

        In 1995 Richard Cork, the art critic for The Times, observed that “New art in this country

enjoys an outstandingly high reputation today. Curators, critics and collectors in many different

countries are excited about the vitality of British artists.” Cork observed that the YBAs “have

proved that Britain is capable of producing a remarkably self-assured and inventive generation

busily redefining accepted ideas about what art can be,” and speculated that “they may well go on

to win for modern British art an even higher reputation than the one it already enjoys.”7 In 1997

Norman Rosenthal, the Exhibitions Secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, cautiously

but firmly raised the possibility that London had already overtaken New York:

                Can London become the unchallenged center for the practice and
                presentation of contemporary art? In the past, Paris, New York and
                even Düsseldorf have been able aggressively to claim this role, by
                virtue of the density of activity in each city over considerable
                periods of time, with many artists, as well as collectors and
                galleries, contributing to the debate with originality and daring. If
                London could now claim such a position, that would be a first, and
                surely grounds for celebration.8

And in 1998, in an early example of the definite assertion of English preeminence, the critic

Matthew Collings, who received an MA in Fine Art from Goldsmiths’ College, flatly declared:

“Always remember, New Yorkers, young British art now dominates the world, even your

world.”9

        In the long run, artistic importance depends on influence: the most important artists are

those who have the greatest impact on the art of the next generation. In the past, gauging artistic
                                                    5

influence might require decades, for there could be substantial lags in the diffusion of significant

inventions. As will be discussed below, however, these lags are generally shorter today, for the

nature of contemporary art allows innovations to diffuse quickly, and allows new methods to be

adopted quickly by other artists. It is still possible for influence to manifest itself over longer

periods, so an assessment of the importance of the YBAs made today cannot be final. Yet as

Damien Hirst arrives at the age of 40, it is of some interest to see how the YBAs are doing, based

on the returns to date.

The Market Test

                The art world’s about money.
                                                Damien Hirst, 199610

        The auction market provides a vast amount of information about the relative importance

of different artists. Many in the art world are dismissive of this evidence, claiming that auction

outcomes are uncorrelated with genuine artistic importance, but recent research has shown that

this claim is wrong.11 And interestingly, although it has long been fashionable for artists to

express a lack of interest in the market, in recent decades some leading contemporary artists have

openly pursued and embraced success in the market. Perhaps most succinctly, Jeff Koons

declared that “The market is the greatest critic.”12

        This study will use auction outcomes to measure the importance of the YBAs compared

to that of their American peers. Each artist will be ranked according to the highest price for

which his or her work has ever sold at auction.13

        Most of the YBAs were born during the 1960s. For comparison to American artists, they

will be divided into two 10-year birth cohorts: those born during 1955-64, who are currently
                                                    6

between the ages of 41-50, and those born during 1965-74, aged 31-40 in 2005. More of the

YBAs are in the second of these cohorts than the first, and the comparisons will therefore

indicate whether British artists have gained in importance relative to Americans over time. A

further important point involves who will considered an American or British artist. These

designations will be assigned not by place of birth or by citizenship, but by place of residence.14

The justification for this that the interest of this study is not legal, but cultural. Where an artist

lives and works determines where he is most influenced by, and most contributes to, the artistic

innovations of his time. The analysis will furthermore not be restricted to living artists, for the

interest of this study is not exclusively in where the most important art is currently being made,

but rather in where it has been made by artists in the relevant birth cohorts.

        Tables 1 and 2 rank the top ten American and British artists, respectively, of the first birth

cohort, by the measure described above. The comparison clearly favors the Americans. Six

Americans have realized higher auction prices than any of their British contemporaries, and nine

of the top 10 artists in the two tables combined are Americans. Four Americans have realized

auction prices over $1 million, and nine over $500,000, compared to no British artists over $1

million, and only one over $500,000. One other interesting feature of the tables is the presence of

five foreign-born artists among the top 10 Americans, compared to three among the top 10

British artists.

        Tables 3 and 4 provide the rankings of the top ten artists from both countries for the

second birth cohort. This comparison yields sharply different results. The highest two prices in

the two tables are for British artists, as are five of the highest six. Two artists in these tables have

realized auction prices over $1 million, and both are British, as are three of the four artists in the
                                                  7

two tables who have realized prices over $500,000. The only clear American advantage is in

depth, as the tenth American artist has a price more than twice that of the tenth British artist. And

as in the earlier comparison, there are more foreign-born artists among the top 10 Americans

(three) than among the top 10 British artists (one).

Do the YBAs Rule?

               All us lot, we ... caned the ... art world. Absolutely totally
               phenomenal. We caned the art world as ... kids.
                                                 Damien Hirst, 199915

       As the YBAs enter middle age, the auction market does support the claim that Damien

Hirst and other British artists of his birth cohort have made greater contributions to advanced art

than American artists their age. The greater depth of the American ranking of Table 3 may

provide little comfort for American partisans, for most scholars and critics recognize that a few

major artists usually have a disproportionate impact on the art of their time.

       Table 1 confirms that the YBAs entered an art world dominated by Americans. Although

Koons, Basquiat, and Haring were not much older than the YBAs, they had all had early success

that made their examples, and their innovations, available to the British artists before the latter

had finished art school. So for example Hirst’s celebrated works with dead animals suspended in

glass tanks owed a direct debt to Koons’ earlier use of glass tanks for his floating basketballs.

       Table 4 similarly confirms that Hirst and his fellow YBAs currently hold a clear lead over

their American counterparts. Hirst’s position in the table supports critical judgments that he has

made the greatest impact on the art world of any member of his generation. Table 4 further

suggests that Chris Ofili may be emerging as a leading representative of the impact of

globalization on fine art, for he traces his influences to the art of Africa. Tables 2 and 4 also point
                                                 8

to a number of other YBAs, including Rachel Whiteread, Jenny Saville, and Tim Noble and Sue

Webster, who are already important artists.

       Interestingly, this conclusion about the YBAs is supported not only by British critics, but

by a leading American critic. In 1999, when Charles Saatchi’s collection of the work of a number

of YBAs was presented at the Brooklyn Museum as Sensation, Arthur Danto declared that it

displayed “an exuberance, a confidence, a swagger unfortunately not to be found in the

demoralized American art world of today.” Danto observed that “virtually everything in this

gallery is the kind of reflection on art in which so much of modern and contemporary art

consists,” and specifically praised the work of Damien Hirst, Jenny Saville, and Rachel

Whiteread.16

Does London Rule?

               The center of the ... art world’s in England. You know that, don’t
               you?
                                                      Damien Hirst, 200017

       The question of whether London has passed New York for the leadership of the advanced

art world is more complicated. It is unlikely that New York will soon be replaced as the business

center of the art world, and its major market. Yet the intriguing question is whether London will

become established as the central place for the production of new art. The English critics quoted

earlier believe that it will, and they are not alone. So for example Iwan Wirth, a leading dealer in

contemporary art, who might be considered neutral not only because he is Swiss but also because

he owns galleries in both London and New York, recently compared the two cities by observing

that although New York “will remain the art capital of the world,” London “has more creative

energy, the most interesting potential.”18 In similar language, Michael Hue-Williams, an English
                                                  9

dealer, observed that “New York is still the much bigger market and has many more artists, but

London is full of energy and enthusiasm and certainly giving New York a run for its money at the

moment.”19

       During most of the modern era, at any given time there has been a single city that

dominated the production of advanced art. Yet because of the nature of contemporary art, it is

possible that this will not necessarily continue to be the case. A brief examination of the

evolution of modern art will indicate the logic behind this proposition.20

       In the late 19th century, major contributions to advanced art were made only by artists

who worked in Paris. Vincent van Gogh recognized the connection between Paris and artistic

innovation after he had gone to the city to advance his career, as he wrote to a fellow artist who

remained in Holland that “There is but one Paris... What is to be gained is progress and what the

deuce that is, it is to be found here.”21 Even the most gifted artists who did not travel to Paris

could become only regional figures in art history.

       Advances in art, as in other intellectual disciplines, can only be made by those who have a

firm understanding of the most advanced work of their time.22 In the late 19th century, this was

Impressionism: all the major innovations of the decades after 1880 either built on or reacted

against the discoveries of Monet and his colleagues. Impressionism was an experimental art, with

goals and methods that could not easily be described precisely, and it could be learned well only

through direct contact with its practitioners. Paris consequently was the breeding ground for the

movements that constituted the most advanced art of the late 19th century, from Neo-

Impressionism and Symbolism to Cézanne’s form of Post-Impressionism.

       Paris’ monopoly of advanced art ended in the early 20th century, not only because of the
                                                  10

impact of World War I but also because of the changing nature of advanced art. The conceptual

art of the central movements of the first decade of the century, Fauvism and Cubism, could be

transmitted much more readily than the experimental art of Impressionism. So for example in

Moscow Malevich could make his dramatic conceptual departure into Suprematism without

traveling to Paris, because he could understand the recent conceptual developments in Paris

merely by seeing paintings by Picasso, Braque, Léger, and others. The conceptual Dada

movement also originated outside Paris during World War I, and spread rapidly: in the words of

the German Dada artist Hannah Höch, in 1919 when the Dadaists developed photomontage, one

of their key innovations, “it happened, strangely enough and simultaneously, in a number of quite

diverse countries.”23

        Paris never fully regained its artistic vitality after World War I, and New York’s

ascension to the central position in advanced art was accelerated by the migration to America of

many important European artists who were fleeing from the Nazis. With the maturation of the

experimental art of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, New York became a

necessary destination for the most ambitious young artists, for Pollock, de Kooning, Rothko, and

their colleagues produced the major art of their time, and understanding their goals and methods

required direct contact with them.

        This changed in the late 1950s, when Johns and Rauschenberg introduced new forms of

art that initated an era of conceptual art that has continued to the present. The clarity of this art

generally meant that innovations could diffuse more rapidly. So for example in the early ‘60s

Richter and Polke could produce important innovations in painting that built directly on those of

the American Pop artists in spite of the fact that they had not been to New York, and had seen the
                                                 11

work of Warhol and Lichtenstein only in reproduction. Since the ‘60s, New York has remained

the primary center for the production of advanced art, but it has not had a monopoly even within

the US, as for example Nauman, perhaps the most important artist to emerge in the late ‘60s, has

never lived or worked in the city. And the conceptual nature of important recent American art,

including that of Nauman and Koons, meant that Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Sarah Lucas,

and the other YBAs could assimilate it and build on it without ever going to New York.

       The analysis outlined here explains why the art world will no longer necessarily have a

single dominant central location. As long as conceptual approaches predominate, London can

continue to be an important source of new art, without requiring that New York decline into a

subsidiary role. There remains the question, however, of whether London will in fact continue to

produce important new art in generations after the YBAs. It is still too soon to look to the auction

market to identify the important artists of the next cohort, who are currently under 30. There is an

implicit warning in the statement quoted earlier by Norman Rosenthal, who named Düsseldorf as

a previous center of the art world. He was evidently referring to the remarkable period in the

early ‘60s, when Richter and Polke were among the students of Beuys at the Düsseldorf

Academy of Art. But that period was an isolated episode, as Düsseldorf did not become a

continuing source of artistic innovations. It is too early to tell whether London will be able to

continue its success. One relevant issue pointed up by the tables examined above is whether in

future London will be able to match New York as a magnet for important artists born in other

countries. It has not done so in the past, but the current excitement over London’s art scene may

serve to change this in future.

Why do the YBAs Rule?
                                                12

               Art’s popular. That’s my generation. It wasn’t before.
                                                    Damien Hirst, 200024

       The work of the YBAs is extremely diverse, and is not marked by a common style. A

number of critics have attempted to generalize about their art. Thus for example Richard Shone

wrote that:

               None was motivated by didactic, socio-political issues; all took for
               granted the lessons of conceptual and minimal art; none was... a
               legibly figurative artist; and many introduced autobiographical and
               personal elements into their work. Materials used were invariably
               demotic, drawn from their immediate environment... Most difficult
               of all to characterize is perhaps a shared directness and confidence
               in their imagery, whether dealing in grand, universal themes or in
               more particular observations from contemporary life.

Shone furthermore observed that “the work of Damien Hirst epitomizes the general change in

sensibility... [S]imple, powerful presentation, derived from aspects of minimal art, was the

framework for subject matter of a highly charged and, for some, shocking content. He tackled

head-on the eternal themes of life, death and regeneration, freedom and liberty, beauty and

ugliness.”25

       Michael Craig-Martin, an artist and teacher at Goldsmiths’ College who is often

considered the mentor of the YBAs, stressed the conceptual clarity of their work in explaining its

broad appeal: “It never occurred to artists of this generation to make art that people wouldn’t get

and wouldn’t like. They thought that if people didn’t get it, then they must have done something

wrong. Now that is not what artists of my generation behaved like. There is now a transparency

to it all.”26 Damien Hirst agreed, explaining that one of his aims has been to “make art that

everybody could believe in.”27 Rachel Whiteread told a critic that “one of the reasons my work is

kind of popular is that it’s connected with everybody’s lives.” The familiarity of the objects and
                                                  13

living spaces she uses in her plaster casts serves to overcome the distrust that so many people

have of modern art: “Because so many of my pieces are connected with what everybody has in

their homes or relates to in their daily lives, they make them think twice about something.”28

Douglas Gordon stressed that he wanted his work to engage its viewers: “My interest in art is not

so much to create valuable or beautiful objects as to create situations that people can go home

from and tell stories about.”29

       In 2001 an American critic, Jerry Saltz, wrote of the YBAs as a group in a way that is

reminiscent of the accounts of American Abstract Expressionists, an earlier group of major artists

who also did not share a common style: “the British have something we lack, and that is

community, by which I mean a small group of people who spend a fair amount of time together,

stay up late, and probably drink and argue about art with one another... [T]here’s a sense of

camaraderie that’s absent here.”30 The YBAs may thus be the most recent example of a

phenomenon remarked on by Sir Alan Bowness, the former Director of the Tate Gallery, that

“Most truly original new art is the result of group activity. It appears that the conjunction of

several exceptional talents results in something that is greater than the parts.”31

Conclusion

               What I do affects the course of art.
                                             Damien Hirst, 199932

       The auction market provides considerable evidence that the YBAs do rule over their

American counterparts. During the past decade the East End of London appears to have become

as central to contemporary art as Greenwich Village was in the 1950s: “The Chapmans run a tiny

gallery out of Jake’s house, next door to Chris Ofili’s, a block from Gilbert & George’s. Tracey
                                                 14

Emin lives nearby; so do Peter Doig, Marc Quinn, Gary Hume, Wolfgang Tillmans, Tim Noble

and Sue Webster, and Rachel Whiteread. Locals boast the area has ‘the highest concentration of

working artists in Europe.’”33 In spite of London’s recent success, however, it may be premature

for Americans to concede definitely that London has replaced New York as the major generative

center for contemporary art, for it will require at least another generation to demonstrate that

London will become the next New York rather than the next Düsseldorf.

       In the conceptual art world of the past five decades, young geniuses have typically made

their main contributions at early ages, and have then quickly been replaced by younger

innovators. The YBAs are aware of this, as for example Damien Hirst reflected in 1999 that

“Probably the most major piece I’m ever going to make in my lifetime I made right at the

beginning.”34 Yet as Hirst recognized, importance in the art world is a function of influence, and

his importance seems considerable. So also in 1999 he observed that “The position I’m in now,

I’m responsible for a hell of a lot of things to do with the art world.”35 Who is influenced by the

YBAs, how, and where, will ultimately determine whether the YBAs will genuinely rule, and

whether London will successfully steal the idea of postmodern art from New York.
