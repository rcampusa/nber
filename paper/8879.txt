Dollarization and Trade

                                              ABSTRACT


        Dollarization has been suggested as a policy that might, among other goals, promote trade
between a country adopting the dollar and the United States. Evidence supporting this conjecture could
be drawn from a recent series of papers by Rose and co-authors who show that a currency union increases
bilateral trade among its members, and that this effect is both large and statistically significant. In this
paper we show that this result is not robust if we consider bilateral United States trade (even though the
United States accounts for 60 percent of all observations of currency unions between industrial and non-
industrial countries), nor if we consider bilateral trade of countries that have adopted the United States
dollar, like Panama. Furthermore, the effect of dollarization on trade with the United States is not
statistically distinct from the effect of a fixed dollar exchange rate on trade with the United States.

I. Introduction

        In the ongoing controversy over the appropriate exchange rate regime, events of

the 1990s have led some to the “bipolar view” that countries should either allow their

currencies to float or opt for a hard peg, like a currency union or dollarization.1 The hard

peg option is seen as having two potential benefits; providing a nominal anchor for

macroeconomic stability, and fostering trade integration between an emerging market

country and the industrial country to which it links its currency.2

        The conjecture that currency unions foster trade integration could be supported by

reference to a series of papers solely authored and also co-authored by Andrew Rose.3

Rose and his co-authors demonstrate that membership in a currency union has a large,

statistically significant effect on bilateral trade patterns. Using data sets with tens of

thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of observations on the volume of bilateral

trade, and augmenting a gravity model analysis with a dummy variable that indicates

membership in a currency union, a typical result is that the coefficient on the currency

1
 Stanley Fischer (2001) offers an overview of this debate. It is worth noting at the outset that a
currency union and dollarization are conceptually distinct. A currency union involves the
establishment of a new central bank that may be administered by representatives from all
countries using the new transnational currency. Dollarization, in contrast, implies the adoption of
the currency of another country (typically the US dollar). While “currency unions” between non-
industrial countries and either the United States or Australia are better characterized as cases of
dollarization, we will use these terms interchangeably.
2
  For example, Andrew Berg and Eduardo Borensztein (2000) write “Dollarization may also
bring other benefits: closer integration with both the United States and the global economy would
be promoted by lower transaction costs and an assured stability of prices in dollar terms.”
Rudiger Dornbusch (2001) writes “There is a whole range of economies that are doing all right
(say, Hungary or Mexico) that would benefit from the immediate introduction of currency boards
to deepen economic integration and hence build much better growth prospects.” (p. 242).
Alberto Alesina and Robert Barro (2001) state that Mexico and many Central American should be
interested in dollarization, based on, among other factors, their trade with the United States.
3
These include Andrew Rose (2000), Jeffrey Frankel and Rose (forthcoming), Reuven Glick and
Rose (forthcoming), and Rose and Eric van Wincoop (2001).



                                                 1
union dummy variable is highly significant and its value suggests that membership in a

currency union, ceteris paribus, nearly quadruples bilateral trade.4 Based on these

results, Rose and van Wincoop (2001) conclude that “Reducing these [trade] barriers

through currency unions like EMU or dollarization in the Americas will thus result in

increased international trade.” Frankel and Rose (forthcoming) offer estimates

suggesting that dollarization would raise the trade-to-GDP ratio substantially in many

Western Hemisphere countries.5

        In this paper, we show that there is little robust evidence that dollarization

promotes greater trade with the United States, especially among those countries that are

the most likely candidates for dollarization.6 These results contrast with those of Rose

and his co-authors. The source of this difference is that this paper focuses on bilateral

trade for sets of dyads in which one country is the United States or sets of dyads in which

one country has a currency union with the United States (e.g., Panama). In the face of

possible parameter heterogeneity, results from these sub-samples offer a more precise

gauge of the effect of dollarization than do results from the much wider samples used by



4
  For example, Frankel and Rose (forthcoming) present an estimated coefficient on the currency
union dummy variable of 1.38 in their Table 1, with an associated standard error of 0.19. This
result suggests that membership in a currency union raises bilateral trade by a factor of 3.97,
ceteris paribus, since the regressand is the logarithm of trade and e1.38=3.97. This result is cited
in Rose and van Wincoop (2001).
5
 See their Table V. Some estimates include an increase in trade-to-GDP of 39 percentage points
in Guatemala, 24 percentage points in Chile, 91 percentage points in Costa Rica, 7 percentage
points in Brazil and 93 percentage points in Mexico.
6
  Other work that revisits the analysis of the effect of membership in a currency union on trade
includes Volker Nitsch (forthcoming, 2002a, 2002b), Torsten Persson (2001), Michael Pakko and
Howard Wall (2001) and Silvana Tenreyro (2001). Sebastian Edwards (2001) presents evidence
on other effects of dollarization, including inflation performance, growth, fiscal performance and
the incidence of major current account reversals.

Rose and his co-authors.7 It is worth noting that dyads that include the United States

account for 60 percent of the cases of currency unions between industrial and non-

industrial countries that have complete data and can be used in the empirical analysis.8 In

fact, the only industrial country other than the United States that has usable data for

sustained currency unions with more than one country in the post-Bretton Woods era is

Australia, which had currency unions with the small island nations of Kiribati, the

Solomon Islands and Tonga. Dyads including Australia represent another 25 percent of

all dyads with currency unions between industrial and non-industrial countries.

        One might expect to find larger estimates of the effect of currency unions on trade

in the sub-sample of dyads in which one country is the United States, as compared to the

wider samples used by Rose and his co-authors, since, presumably, countries in sustained

dollar currency unions are those that most benefit from membership and increased trade

with the United States is one such benefit. However, this is not the case. For example, as

shown in Section II.1, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is highly

significant for the full sample, and even larger and almost as significant for trade between

industrial and non-industrial countries. But, as shown in Section II.2, the coefficient on

the currency union dummy variable is only about one-third as large using the sample of


7
  A related question linked to the issue of parameter stability across subsets of the wide sample
has to do with the likely trade effects of EMU. The only observations in the samples used by
Rose and his co-authors that represent a currency union between industrial countries are those of
trade between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Rodney Thom and Brendan Walsh
(2001) conclude that this currency union had only a negligible effect on trade, a result that Glick
and Rose (forthcoming) maintain “cannot be reasonably generalized.” (p. 9). Nitsch (2002b)
concludes that the currency union between Belgium and Luxembourg did not lead to a significant
increase in trade between these countries.

 Here, countries with an IFS identification number less than 200 are classified as “Industrial”
while those with an IFS identification number greater than 200 are classified as “Non-Industrial.”
See the appendix for a list of “Industrial” and “Non-Industrial” countries.



                                                 3
dyads in which one country is the United States. This coefficient is not significant at the

5 percent level for all United States bilateral trade, and it is not significant at the 10

percent level when we slightly modify the way in which one of the control variables is

defined, or when we restrict the sample to all United States trade with non-industrial

countries. If we hone in even more closely on a sub-sample that reflects current and

potential candidates for dollarization, by considering dyads consisting of the United

States and other Western Hemisphere countries (a sub-sample that consists of almost 90

percent of the actual currency union observations for the United States), we find that the

currency union coefficient is about one-fifth of its full sample value and is not significant

at the 25 percent level. Furthermore, as shown in Section II.3, regressions using dyads

centered on countries that had a currency union with the United States fail to offer

significant coefficients on currency unions.

        The regressions presented in Section II.4 consider the effect of a sustained fixed

dollar exchange rate, as well as a currency union, on trade with the United States. The

inclusion of the dummy variable for a fixed dollar exchange rate raises the significance of

the currency union dummy variable, but not beyond the 20 percent level for a regression

using the sample consisting of trade between the United States and other Western

Hemisphere countries. These regressions also show that dollarization does not have an

effect on trade with the United States that is statistically distinct from the effect of

maintaining a fixed dollar exchange rate, even though it is often maintained that

dollarization is somehow different than a fixed exchange rate along this dimension.

        The one case in which we do find a robust effect of dollarization on trade is for

currency unions with the Australian dollar rather than the greenback. These results are




                                               4
presented in Section II.5. But, as noted above, this result is based on currency unions for

three very small island nations and one may not want to generalize this result.



II. Currency Unions and Bilateral Trade

        The basic approach used to determine whether a currency union promotes trade,

first employed by Rose (2000), is to augment a gravity model of trade flows with a

dummy variable representing membership in a currency union. The time-series cross-

section model has, as its dependent variable, the logarithm of bilateral trade denominated

in thousands of real American dollars. The regressors include, along with a dummy

variable indicating membership in a currency union, the logarithm of distance between

the countries, the logarithm of the product of their real national incomes, the logarithm of

the product of their real per capita national income, the logarithm of the product of their

land areas and dummy variables representing the presence of a common border, a

common language, a free trade agreement, a common colonizer, political union, and

whether one country is an ex-colony of another. The specification of all of the

regressions in this paper replicates the functional form used in Glick and Rose

(forthcoming) that includes, along with these regressors, fixed effects for years. 9 The

data set used in this paper, which is from Glick and Rose (forthcoming), includes annual

observations on 165 countries (27 industrial countries and 138 non-industrial countries).10


9
 Rose states on his website that he is most favorably disposed towards the fixed effects method
used in Glick and Rose (forthcoming). Two authors applying alternative estimation methods to
these data are Persson (2001), who uses a matching technique, and Tenereyro (2001) who
corrects for possible sample selection bias.
10
   Rose makes other data sets on currency unions and trade available on his website but he states
that these data have been the most extensively checked. As noted in Glick and Rose
(forthcoming), there are many gaps in the data due to both missing data and values of trade that


                                                5
Glick and Rose (forthcoming) use data from 1948 to 1997, but in this paper we focus on

data from the post-Bretton Woods period and all regressions use data from 1974 to 1997,

inclusive.11



II. 1 Full Sample Results

        We begin by presenting two regressions, one that uses the full sample of dyads

and another in which the sample consists of dyads representing trade between industrial

countries and non-industrial countries. Table 1 reports the estimates from these

regressions, with the full sample results in Column I and the results from the regression

using the sub-sample consisting of trade between industrial countries and non-industrial

countries in Column II. This table also reports the number of total observations used in

the regression, the number of observations in which there is a currency union between

two countries, the percentage of total observations accounted for by dyads with a

currency union, and the geometric average of the bilateral trade variable.

        The results in this table are typical of those presented by Rose and his co-authors.

For the full sample (Column I), the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable

equals 1.52 and the associated t-statistic is 9.11. This result suggests that a currency

union increases trade by a factor of 4.57 (exp(1.52) = 4.57), ceteris paribus. This result

is based on a sample with 152,960 observations, representing trade flows among 165


equal zero which, when the logarithm of trade is calculated, are set to missing. The appendix lists
the countries represented in the data set.
11
  We focus on the post-1973 period since the effects of dollarization on trade would likely be
stronger when the rest of the world is not on a dollar-based exchange rate standard since, after the
Bretton Woods era, there is a greater distinction between dollarization and the exchange rate
arrangements of the rest of the world.

countries, a sample that includes 1,783 dyads with currency unions (1.17 percent of the

total sample). As shown in Column II, the estimated effect of a currency union on trade

between industrial and non-industrial countries is even larger, increasing that trade by a

factor of 5.53 (= exp(1.71)), ceteris paribus. The coefficient on the currency union

dummy variable is significant at more than the 99 percent level of confidence in this

sample, which includes 65,059 observations, with 175 of them representing dyads in

which there is a currency union (0.27 percent of the sample). In both regressions, almost

all the other regressors are significant at the 99 percent level of confidence.



II. 2 Dollar Currency Unions and United States Bilateral Trade

        We next consider a sample in which each observation represents trade between

the United States and another country. This sample selection enables us to gauge more

precisely, in the face of possible parameter heterogeneity, the effects of dollarization on

trade. To begin, we list in Table 2 all the countries that had a currency union with the

United States in the post-Bretton Woods era and that had data for all variables used in the

regression, and the years during which they had a currency union with the United States.

For the sake of completeness, we also list all other currency unions in the post-1973

sample in which one of the countries is an industrial country and for which complete data

are available such that the observations can be included in the regression analysis.12 As

shown in Table 2, the countries that joined currency unions with industrial countries were


12
  Observations in the data set that represent currency unions between industrial and non-
industrial countries in the post-Bretton Woods era, but do not have complete data, include three
currency unions involving the United Kingdom (with the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and St.
Helena), two currency unions involving Australia (with Nauru and with Tuvalu), and the currency
unions between the United States and Guam, and between France and St. Pierre & Miquelon.



                                               7
generally quite small. Among the usable, post-1973 data, dyads that include currency

unions with the United States account for 60 percent of all dyads between industrial

countries and non-industrial countries in which there is a currency union, and dyads that

include currency unions with Australia account for another 25 percent of the total.

        Table 3 reports the results for gravity equations augmented with a currency union

dummy variable in which each dyad includes the United States as one of the trade

partners. Columns I.a and I.b in this table report regressions in which the sample

includes United States bilateral trade with all countries in the sample. The first column

uses the Glick and Rose data without modification. In this case, the coefficient on the

currency union dummy variable is 0.50, with an associated p-value of 0.065. Thus, this

estimate suggests that a U.S. dollar currency union increases trade by 65 percent

(exp(0.5)=1.65), but this result, significant at the 93.5% level of confidence, is much less

precise than those from the full sample cited above.

        This result, however, is sensitive to a slight modification of the value of the

dummy variable that represents whether one country in the dyad was a former colony of

the other country in the dyad. In the Glick and Rose data set, the ex-Colony dummy

variable equals 1 for two sets of dyads involving the United States: the United States and

the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom. In the Column I.b in

Table 3, we modify this definition of ex-Colony for the United States by including both

the United States – United Kingdom dyad as a separate dummy variable and by scoring

the Unite States – Liberia dyad as one representing a former colonial relationship.13 The


13
  Liberia, the only country outside the Western Hemisphere that had a currency union with the
United States in the post-Bretton Woods era, was founded in 1822 as a result of the efforts of the
American Colonization Society to settle freed American slaves in West Africa. Over the course
of forty years, about 12,000 slaves were voluntarily relocated. The colony became the Free and


                                                8
results in this column suggest that it is important to separate a dummy variable for United

States – United Kingdom trade from that of the other two colonial relationships since the

coefficient on the US – UK trade dummy variable is negative whereas the coefficient on

the newly defined ex-Colony dummy variable is positive, and both coefficients are

significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence. But more to the point, with

the inclusion of Liberia as an ex-colony of the United States, the coefficient on the

currency union dummy is no longer significant at standard levels of confidence, with its

p-value equal to 0.146 and its value falling by 30 percent to 0.35.14

        Most of the countries that are seen as potential candidates for dollarization are

non-industrial countries. Column II of Table 3 investigates the estimated effect of

currency unions on trade between the United States and non-industrial countries.15 The

sample used in this regression includes 2,870 observations, which is 83 percent of the

number of observations in Column I, but with the same 105 dyads representing currency

unions as in the regressions reported in Column I. Note that the average level of trade

between the United States and non-industrial countries is almost twice that of the average

level of trade between all industrial countries and non-industrial countries. Comparing

the regression results in Column II with those in Column I.a (since we keep the original



Independent Republic of Liberia in 1847. The English-speaking Americo-Liberians, descendants
of former American slaves, make up only 5% of the population of Liberia, but have historically
dominated its intellectual and ruling class. (from the Learning Network site
www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107718.html).
14
  If we have the only modify the ex-Colony dummy variable by changing its value from 0 to 1
for the US – Liberia dyad then the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 0.45 and
the associated t-statistic is 0.25, resulting in a p-value of 0.076.
15
  See the appendix for a list of all the countries used in the regression analysis, including the
breakdown into those that are non-industrial and those that are in the Western Hemisphere.

Glick and Rose ex-Colony variable), we see that most of the coefficients in Column II are

quite close to their values in Column I.a, but the significance of the currency union

dummy variable has now decreased such that its p-value is 0.126.16

        A further refinement of the sample considers only trade between the United States

and countries in the Western Hemisphere since these countries are the most likely

candidates for a dollar currency union (as opposed to countries outside the Western

Hemisphere that may be candidates for linking their currencies to the euro or some other

currency). The average level of trade in this sub-sample is more than triple the average

level of trade between the United States and all non-industrial countries. Column III of

Table 3 presents the results of a regression in which one member of each dyad is the

United States and the other member is a country in the Western Hemisphere. This

sample includes 764 observations, 12 percent of which represent currency unions, a

figure that is much larger than in the other sub-samples. While distance, the product of

countries’ GDP, and common language retain their significance in this regression, the

currency union dummy variable does not (nor do some of the other control variables).

The p-value of the currency union dummy variable in this regression is 0.267.17




16
  If we include Liberia as an ex-Colony, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is
0.28, with a standard error of 0.25, which implies a p-value of 0.267.
17
  The only industrial country trading with the United States in this sample is Canada. If we
exclude Canada from the Western Hemisphere sample, the average level of trade is $3,003,233
thousand. In a regression with all Western Hemisphere countries but for Canada, the coefficient
on the currency union dummy variable is 0.29, with a standard error of 0.27, resulting in a p-
value of 0.279.



                                               10
II. 3 Bilateral Trade of Countries Linked to the Dollar

        The results presented in the previous section cast doubt on whether the United

States trades more with countries that have dollarized. A related, though distinct,

question is whether countries that have dollarized trade more with the United States than

with other countries. This question is addressed by the regression results in Table 4.

Each column in this table reports a regression in which the observations are all the dyads

that include the country listed at the head of the column. These countries are the ones

listed in Table 2 that had a currency union with the United States in the post-Bretton

Wood era. For reasons discussed in more detail below, we also include regressions

representing Argentine trade in Table 4.

        The results in Table 4 provide little evidence that linking to the U.S. dollar

promoted greater trade with the United States.18 The only case where there is a positive

and significant coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is for the Dominican

Republic, in which case the estimated value of the coefficient is 0.83 and its associated p-

value is 0.06. In the other two cases in which the estimated coefficient is positive, the

Bahamas and Liberia, the p-values are 0.189 and 0.311, respectively. The estimated

coefficients on the currency union dummy variables are negative for the regressions for

Bermuda, Guatemala and Panama, although none of the associated p-values are less than

0.13.

        Table 4 does provide an example, however, of an estimated currency union

coefficient that is both negative and significant (at better than the 10 percent level of
18
  Furthermore, one might expect that these countries were the most likely to have demonstrated
trade benefits from a currency union since they did, in fact, choose to dollarize. Alesina and
Barro (2001) present a model in which the country that most gains from adopting the currency of
another country is one that is small, open, and has its trade centered with one particularly large
partner.


                                                11
confidence). Argentina adopted the peso on January 1, 1992, with its value pegged to the

United States dollar at a rate of one peso to one dollar. This currency board continued

until December 2001, four years beyond the end of the sample of trade data available to

us. The column labeled “Argentina” in Table 4 reports an estimate of a regression for all

bilateral Argentine trade in which the currency union dummy variable is set equal to 1 for

the years 1992 – 1997. As shown in that column, the estimated coefficient on the

currency union dummy variable is –0.57, with a standard error of 0.31, resulting in a p-

value of 0.068.19



II. 4 Dollarization Versus a Fixed Exchange Rate

        Rose (2000) distinguishes between the effect of a currency union on trade and the

effect of a fixed exchange rate on trade, writing “…a very stable exchange rate may not

be the same as membership of a common currency area. Sharing a common currency is a

much more serious and durable commitment than a fixed rate.” (pp. 10-11). Rose tests

whether the effect of a currency union on trade goes beyond its effect on stabilizing the

exchange rate by including various measures of exchange rate volatility, along with the

currency union dummy variable and the other regressors discussed above, in the gravity

trade equation. Rose finds that exchange rate volatility enters the regression with a

negative and significant coefficient. More to the point, the coefficient on the currency

union dummy variable is significant, even with the inclusion of exchange rate volatility

as a regressor.

19
  While the decision to adopt a currency board in Argentina reflected the policy goal of monetary
stabilization rather than trade promotion, we might still have expected to see evidence of the
latter.



                                               12
          An alternative way to test whether there is a distinct difference between

dollarizing and having a fixed exchange rate, one that allows us to address this issue more

directly, is to include a separate dummy variable for a fixed exchange rate in the gravity

regression. While a relatively small number of countries dollarized, many more pegged

their currencies to the U.S. dollar at some time during the post-Bretton Woods era. Table

5 presents all the observations among the data used in the regressions in which there was

not a currency union but, nonetheless, there was a consecutive period of at least five

years during which the respective U.S. dollar exchange rates varied by less than 1 percent

each year.20 As shown in Table 5, there are 508 dyads among the usable data that meet

this criterion (recall from Table 2 that these data include 105 dyads in which there is a

currency union with the United States). These 508 dyads include 357 dyads between the

United States and another country in the Western Hemisphere (as compared to 92

currency union dyads), and 151 dyads between the United States and a country outside

the Western Hemisphere, either in Africa or Asia (as compared to 13 currency union

dyads).

          In Table 6 we use these data on the occurrence of sustained fixed exchange rates

to augment the gravity trade equation. The regressions presented in Table 6 differ from

those presented earlier in this paper through the inclusion of a dummy variable denoting

the presence of a sustained fixed exchange rate that is not a currency union. The columns

represent results using different sub-samples of the data. The data used to generate the

  For ease of exposition, we refer to the currency behavior for the country – year pairs listed in
Table 5 as fixed exchange rates, even though the dollar exchange rate may have moved by as
much as 1 percent over the course of a year. These data are from Shambaugh (2001) and were
kindly provided by the author. Shambaugh reports that a listing of annual exchange rate pegs
based on actual behavior, like the one in Table 5, differs from a listing based on the reported IMF
exchange rate status in only about 12% of the cases.

results in Column I are all dyads pairing the United States with any other country, the

data used in Column II includes all dyads between the United States and non-industrial

countries, and the data used in Column III includes all dyads between the United States

and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The regressions in Columns I and III of

Table 6 are comparable to those presented in Columns I.b, and III of Table 3,

respectively, while the regression reported in Column II in Table 6 is comparable to the

one mentioned in footnote 16 in which the coefficient on the currency union dummy

variable is 0.28, with a p-value of 0.267.21

       The results presented in Table 6 demonstrate that the augmentation of the

regression specification with a dummy variable representing a fixed exchange rate

increases the value of the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable and also

makes this coefficient more significant. For example, the coefficient on the currency

union dummy variable for a sample of all bilateral United States trade is 0.35, with an

associated p-value of 0.146, when the regression does not include a fixed exchange rate

dummy variable (Table 3, Column I.b), and this coefficient is 0.53, with a p-value of

0.039, when a fixed exchange rate dummy variable is included in the regression (Table 6,

Column I). But dollarization is not the only exchange rate arrangement that promotes

trade in this sample, as the coefficient on the fixed exchange rate dummy variable is 0.40,

with a p-value of 0.033. Furthermore, we cannot distinguish between the effect of a

currency union and the effect of a fixed exchange rate. As shown in Column I of Table 6,

the F-statistic testing the equality of the two coefficients is 0.32 and, with 3,404 degrees


21
  The ex-Colony dummy variable in the regressions in Table 6 equals 1 for both United States –
Philippines dyads and United States – Liberia dyads. Recall that the ex-Colony dummy variable
used in the regression reported in Column II of Table 3 equals 1 for the United States –
Philippines dyad only.


                                               14
of freedom, the p-value for the hypothesis that these coefficients are equal is 0.57. Thus,

while both coefficients are significant in this sample, we cannot distinguish between them

statistically and there is no significant evidence of a special dollarization effect on trade

different from that of a sustained fixed exchange rate.

        The results in Columns II and III in this table demonstrate that the coefficient on

the currency union dummy variable in more narrowly defined samples is not significant

at the 95 percent level, even though the inclusion of a dummy variable representing fixed

exchange rates increases the size and significance of the currency union coefficient. For

a regression using a sample consisting of observations of United States bilateral trade

with non-industrial countries, the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is

0.49 and the associated p-value is 0.093. For a regression drawing on bilateral trade

between the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere, a sample that is

focused on countries that are most likely to consider dollarization, the estimated

coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 0.39, with a p-value of 0.216. In

both of these cases, the coefficient on the fixed exchange rate dummy variable is

statistically indistinguishable from the coefficient on the currency union dummy variable

at standard levels of significance. Thus, there is no evidence that the effects of

dollarization on trade, to the extent that they exist at all, are distinct from the effects of a

sustained fixed exchange rate on trade.



II. 5 Dollarization Down Under

        As shown in Table 2, Australia is the only industrial country other than the United

States in the post-Bretton Woods era that has had a sustained currency union with more



                                               15
than one other country that has complete data and, therefore, can be included in the

empirical analysis. The currency of the Republic of Kiribati continues to be the

Australian dollar while the Australian dollar was the currency of Tonga up until 1990 and

of the Solomon Islands up through 1978. All three of these countries are small island

nations in the Western Pacific. Each is a former colony of Britain. Tonga became

independent in 1970, the Solomon Islands in 1978, and the Republic of Kiribati in 1979.

The estimated 2000 national income of these countries is $76 million for the Republic of

Kiribati, $900 million for the Solomon Islands and $225 million for Tonga, and the

estimated per capita national incomes are $850, $2,000 and $2,200, respectively.22

       Table 7 presents estimates of gravity trade regressions for Australia to

demonstrate the effect of currency unions on bilateral Australian trade. Column I

presents the results of a regression in which the observations represent all dyads that

include Australia, while Column II presents the results of a regression in which each dyad

includes Australia and a non-industrial country. The coefficients on the currency union

dummy variables in these regressions are quite large and significant at greater than the

99.9 percent level. The coefficient on the currency union dummy variable is 2.68 in the

regression that uses all observations of Australian bilateral trade and 2.32 in the

regression using only observations of trade between Australia and non-industrial

countries. These coefficients suggest that a non-industrial country that adopts the

Australian dollar increases its trade with Australia by a factor of 10.18 (=exp(2.32)).

Because this very large effect is based upon an estimate that draws on trade between

Australia and three very small island nations, one might want to use some caution in

                                             16
applying this result to other countries. It is reasonable to be even more reticent to apply

the estimate from the full-sample Australian bilateral trade regression, presented in

Column I, that suggests that dollarizing (with the Australian currency) increases trade by

a factor of 14.58 (=exp(2.68)).



III. Conclusion

       Proposals to dollarize economies are based on two goals, monetary stability and

trade integration. In this paper, we have shown that there is very little evidence that

dollarization promotes trade with the United States for non-industrial countries. This

result contrasts with what one might infer from evidence presented in papers by Rose and

co-authors that suggests that a currency union has the attractive property of promoting

trade. The source of the difference between the results in this paper and the results in the

work by Rose and co-authors is that here we focus on samples that may better represent

the behavior of potential candidates for dollarization. This distinction is important given

the possibility of parameter heterogeneity across samples. In fact, we do find evidence of

parameter instability, with differences in the estimated effect of currency unions on trade

between a full sample and a sample centered on the United States, as well as between a

sample centered on the United States and one centered on Australia. If anything, we

would expect these selective samples to be more likely to show evidence of a significant

effect of dollarization on trade. But we fail to find virtually any evidence that adopting

the United States dollar as a national currency increases trade with the United States.
