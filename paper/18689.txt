                                              ABSTRACT

While several types of mental illness, including substance abuse disorders, have been linked with poor
labor market outcomes, no current research has been able to examine the effects of childhood ADHD.
As ADHD has become one of the most prevalent childhood mental conditions, it is useful to understand
the full set of consequences of the illness. This paper uses a longitudinal national sample, including
sibling pairs, to show important labor market outcome consequences of ADHD. The employment
reduction is between 10-14 percentage points, the earnings reduction is approximately 33%, and the
increase in social assistance is 15 points, which are larger than many estimates of the black-white earnings
gap and the gender earnings gap. A small share of the link is explained by education attainments and
co-morbid health conditions and behaviors. The results also show important differences in labor market
consequences by family background and age of onset. These findings, along with similar research
showing that ADHD is linked with poor education outcomes and adult crime, suggest that treating
childhood ADHD can substantially increase the acquisition of human capital.

Introduction

       While there is a relatively large literature linking mental illness, including

substance dependence, with poor labor market outcomes, few studies have examined the

potential long term consequences of childhood mental health on adult outcomes. Those

studies that have attempted to link childhood mental illness with adult labor market

outcomes have typically focused on measures of adolescent mental health such as

depression and substance dependence (Fletcher 2009a, Ettner et al., 1997, Marcotte and

Wilcox-Gok 2003). In contrast, no studies have been able to examine long term links

between other highly prevalent childhood mental health conditions, such as Attention

Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and adult labor market outcomes. Indeed,

ADHD is one of the most prevalent and fastest growing mental health problems facing

children in the US. The prevalence is typically estimated to be between 2-10% of school-

aged children, with 7.4 percent of parents with children between the age of 3-17 reporting

a doctor has told them their child has ADHD (Bloom and Cohen 2007).

       There are many pathways that could reduce the labor market outcomes of adults

with childhood ADHD symptoms. There are several recent studies that show that

childhood ADHD is associated with early education outcomes, such as grade repetition

and special education placement (Currie and Stabile 2006) as well as longer term

education outcomes, including high school performance (Fletcher and Wolfe 2008,

Currie et al. 2010). Currie et al. (2010) also show evidence that ADHD is associated with

welfare receipt as a young adult. Further there is evidence that the presence of childhood

ADHD symptoms is correlated with criminal activities as a young adult (Fletcher and

Wolfe 2009). While this research is strongly suggestive of potential labor market




                                                                                         1
consequences of ADHD, to date no research has been able to examine this question

(Currie et al. 2010).

       This paper provides the first evidence of links between childhood ADHD

symptoms and adult labor market outcomes. The data come from the national,

prospective Add Health, which tracks individuals between 7-12th grades and outcomes

around age 30. Importantly, to match previous research, this paper is able to examine

sibling differences in outcomes based on childhood ADHD diagnoses and focuses on

employment, earnings, and social assistance receipt for young adults. The consequences

of ADHD on labor market outcomes are large. For example, the findings suggest labor

market participation reductions of approximately 10 percentage points, which are robust

to including controls for co-occurring health conditions and behaviors, years of schooling

as well as family fixed effects. Earnings reductions are estimated to be approximately

30% and social assistance increases are estimated to be 15 percentage points for those

with childhood ADHD. The paper also provides evidence of differences in the effects

based on family background and age at diagnosis.



Background Literature

       ADHD is a neurobehavioral developmental disorder characterized by the co-

existence of both chronic attentional problems and hyperactivity. In particular,

individuals with ADHD are characterized by lags in impulse control development of

approximately 5 years (Shaw et al. 2007), which can cause impairment in a variety of

domains including problem solving, planning ahead, and understanding the actions of




                                                                                          2
others (AACAP 2009). 1 Symptoms typically begin before age seven but often persist

into adulthood (Nair et al. 2006). For example, Wilens et al. (2002) report persistent of

as much as 60% between childhood/adolescent symptoms and adult symptoms.

         Although a controversial diagnosis because of the potential for subjectivity in

evaluation, the American Medical Association has been a proponent of its usefulness as a

disorder. 2 Further, in order to be diagnosed, an individual must show persistent

symptoms in at least two different settings (home, school, etc) for more than six months

and to a degree that is greater than children of the same age.

         While much is known about the family and individual level predictors of

childhood ADHD, there are still many open questions about its specific causes. It is an

illness with high prevalence, with four and a half million children ages 3-17 reported to

have ADHD according to data from the 2006 National Health Interview Study. Briefly,

ADHD symptoms are more likely to occur in males and children in families with low

socioeconomic status, however diagnosis rates could be higher in high income families

due to differences in health care access.. A genetic link has been suggested based on the

higher prevalence among close relatives than the general population and some molecular

genetic ties to ADHD status (Biederman et al. 1990).

         Treatments for ADHD also are somewhat controversial. On one hand, there is

evidence that approximately 70% of the patients with ADHD respond to treatment with

stimulant medications in the short term and over periods of up to 18 months (Olfson et al.

1
  ADHD is also separated into subtypes (attention deficit and hyperactivity); inattentive symptoms include
being easily distracted, having difficulty focusing, not listening when spoken to, struggling to follow
instructions; hyperactive symptoms include talking nonstop, fidgeting, not being able to sit still, having
difficulty doing quiet tasks, and having difficulty waiting for things, among others.
2
  For example, a Council on Scientific Affairs concluded, “diagnostic criteria for ADHD are based on
extensive empirical research and, if applied appropriately, lead to the diagnosis of a syndrome with high
interrater reliability, good face validity, and high predictability of course and medication responsiveness’ in
1998 (Goldman et al. 1998)


                                                                                                             3
2003). However, pharmacotherapy alone has not yet been shown to improve the long-

term outcome for any domain of functioning (Goldman et al. 1998). While the explosion

in pharmacological therapy occurred in 1991, as yet there are no studies of the

consequences of long term use (Davey 2006).

        Much of the work that has linked childhood ADHD or hyperactivity symptoms to

labor market outcomes has used samples from outside the United States and/or used

aggregated measures of early childhood mental health, such as behavioral problem

indices rather than information on diagnoses. For example, Gregg and Machin (1998)

use the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS) data and find that behavioral

problems at age 7 are related to poorer educational attainment at age 16, which in turn is

associated with poor labor market outcomes at ages 23 and 33. 3 A study of a cohort of

all New Zealand children born between 1971 and 1973 in Dunedin found that those with

behavior problems at age 7 to 9 were more likely to be unemployed at age 15 to 21

(Caspi et al., 1998). 4 Importantly, neither study used specific measures of ADHD and

neither was able to use sibling comparisons, so the relationships could be biased from

neighborhood or family factors.

        Other research has focused on educational and other long term consequences of

ADHD, often using sibling fixed effects specifications. Currie and Stabile (2006) was

the first such study, using US and Canadian NLSY data with sibling fixed effects to show

3
  The behavioural problems variables were defined from the following eight “syndrome” scores given in
NCDS: unforthcomingness, withdrawal, depression, anxiety, hostility towards adults, anxiety for
acceptance by children, restlessness and “inconsequential” behaviour. They were entered into the empirical
models as 0-1 dummies indicating positive scores on 1, 2/3 and 4 or more of the 8 measures (with no
positive scores being the reference group).
4
  Behavior problems were assessed with independent parent and teacher ratings of each child's behavior.
The ratings used items from the "antisocial" and "hyperactivity" subscales of the Rutter Child Scales
(Rutter, Tizard, and Whitmore 1970). Items were scored 0 = does not apply, 1 = applies somewhat, 2 =
certainly applies. The authors combined the parent and teacher ratings into a single score to improve the
reliability and validity of this measure.


                                                                                                         4
associations between behavioral symptoms consistent with ADHD 5 and grade repetition,

test scores, and special education placement. Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) followed this

work using the Add Health data with sibling comparisons to show some associations

between ADHD and later education outcomes, such as high school grade point average.

Additionally, Aizer (2009) shows evidence that ADHD “spills over” on classmate test

score performance in elementary school. Currie and Stabile (2009) extend this work

further by using the Canadian and US NLSY datasets and show that hyperactive

symptoms reported by parents are associated with educational outcomes as well as

delinquency, and Fletcher and Wolfe (2009) show associations between childhood

ADHD symptoms and criminal activities as a young adult using sibling fixed effects

models. While these papers are suggestive that childhood ADHD may also have labor

market implications, they do not provide direct evidence.

        The most similar paper to the current study is Currie et al. (2010), who use a

combined ADHD/Conduct disorder category of “externalizing disorders” and show that

this grouping is related to welfare receipt by age 19, grade retention and lower literacy

scores, even using sibling fixed effects; the findings also suggest that later diagnosis may

be associated with worse outcomes. Their data is somewhat limited because it is based

on administrative records from one Canadian province and thus lacks typical social

science measures such as socioeconomic status, etc and does not contain labor market

outcomes. This paper will build from the research base by using national data from the

5
 The authors were only able to concentrate on hyperactivity questions from the Behavior Problems Index:
The hyperactivity subscore has 5 questions:
1. He/she has difficulty concentrating, cannot pay attention for long
2. He/she is easily confused, seems to be in a fog
3. He/she is impulsive, acts without thinking
4. He/she has a lot of difficulty getting his/her mind off certain thoughts
(has obsessions)
5. He/she is restless or overly active, cannot sit still.


                                                                                                          5
US that tracks individuals and sibling pairs though age 30 and thus has labor market

outcome information as well as histories of ADHD status.



Data and Empirical Methods

        The Add Health is a school-based, longitudinal study of the health-related

behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. Beginning with an in-

school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in

grades 7 through 12 in 1994-95 (Wave 1), the study follows up with a series of in-home

interviews of respondents approximately one year (Wave 2; 1996), six years (Wave 3;

2001-2002), and thirteen years later (Wave 4; 2008). By design, the Add Health survey

included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size. 6

        While the original wave 1 sample collected information on over 20,000

respondents, approximately 15,000 were followed longitudinally at wave 4. At the same

time, the data contain a sub-sample of siblings who have been followed over time; this

sample originally numbered approximately 5,400, over half of whom were followed

(along with their co-sibling) longitudinally into wave 4, leaving a sample size for the

sibling analyses of nearly 3,500. 7 In order to maximize available sample sizes for the

analysis, missing family income during high school and maternal education was imputed

and a dummy variable is controlled. Likewise, in some of the auxiliary regressions,




6
  See Udry 2003 for full description of the Add Health data set. The sample may not be representative of
the more general population in that it is a school-based survey and as such, those individuals originally
interviewed at grade 12 in Wave 1 will be very likely to graduate high school. Grade level at Wave 1 is
controlled to reduce this issue.
7
  The reason sample attrition appears more pronounced in the sibling sub-sample than the main sample is
that if either sibling is missing at follow-up, both siblings are dropped from the sample.


                                                                                                       6
missing birth weight and childhood mistreatment information is imputed in order to retain

sample size.

        Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the analysis sample. 8 The earnings data

from wave 4 come from the following question and are interval coded 9: “Now think

about your personal earnings. How much income did you receive from personal earnings

before taxes—that is, wages.” 10 Using this coding procedure, the average earnings for

this sample of adults (average age nearly 30) is nearly $35,000. Separately from the

earnings question, individuals are also asked to report whether they worked ten or more

hours during the previous week, which is the measure of employment available in this

study. In additional analysis, I also examine receipt of public assistance, which includes

welfare payments and food stamps.

         In order to characterize ADHD, this paper uses two measures asked at Wave 4:

(1) “Has a doctor, or nurse, or other health care provider ever told you that you have or

had attention problems or ADD or ADHD?” and (2) “How old were you when the doctor,

nurse, or other health practitioner first told you?” In order to separate “early” and “late”

ADHD, I split the sample by the median age of diagnosis (age 12) reported in the

sample. 11 While recall bias could be an issue with these measures, the 5% of the sample




8
  Like Currie and Stabile (2006), who use sibling comparisons with other datasets, there is very little
difference across sub-samples. Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) also do not find large differences between the
full sample and sibling samples using the Add Health data. See Appendix Table 1A.
9
  The midpoint of each interval is used in the analysis. The intervals include: $0, <$5,000, $5,000-9,999,
10,000-14,999, 15,000-19,999, 20,000-24,999, 25,000-29,999, 30,000-39,999, 40,000-49,999, 50,000-
74,999, 75,000-99,999, 100,000-149,999, 150,000 or more.
10
   The interval coding does not allow an adequate examination using quantile regression specification,
though Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok (2003) use interval-coded earnings data with 23 intervals and assign the
midpoint.
11
   Interestingly, there appears to be no pronounced “clumping” of the age of diagnosis measure in the
sample, say at ages 5 and 10.


                                                                                                             7
who reported a diagnosis of ADHD matches closely with the estimated prevalence of the

illness. 12

         The data also contains rich information on health conditions and (endogenous)

health behaviors. Individuals report behaviors at wave 1 such as tobacco use (25%),

sexual activity (39%), alcohol use (41%), obese status (7%), and marijuana use (14%) as

well as completed a diagnostic tool for depression (8%) at wave 1 of the survey (during

junior high or high school). In Wave 4 of the survey, respondents report whether they

have ever been diagnosed with asthma (15%) or diabetes (3%), and in Wave 3 the

respondents completed an assessment of childhood mistreatment which is combined into

a “mistreatment index” using principal component analysis. 13 Finally, in order to control

for skill accumulation (apart from years of schooling information), the analysis uses

scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), which was administered at

waves 1 and 3. 14

         In Table 2, descriptive statistics are presented based on ADHD status. The

differences foreshadow both some of the results in the paper and empirical issues with

comparing individuals with ADHD vs. individuals without a diagnosis. There are large

differences in employment outcomes between individuals with an ADHD diagnosis and


12
   Appendix Table 2A compares the prevalence rate for Add Health with surveyed children from the NHIS
2009 survey. Overall, the rates are similar, however because these are different cohorts of individuals, and
the prevalence rates have risen over time, it is not surprising that the NHIS rates are higher. Also of note is
that the differences in rates for blacks between the two samples are larger than those of the other groups. It
could be that reports of ADHD may be differentially stigmatized by race and this stigma could be falling
over time. This difference should be considered when viewing the results in this paper.

14
   The Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) is a computerized, abridged version of the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). The AHPVT is a test of hearing vocabulary, designed for
persons aged 2 1/2 to 40 years old who can see and hear reasonably well and who understand standard
English to some degree. The test scores are standardized by age. Some psychologists interpret PVT scores
as a measure of verbal IQ. Information on the test is provided online at

those with no diagnosis. Individuals with ADHD are 9 percentage points less likely to be

currently working and earn incomes that are $4,000 less than those with no ADHD

diagnosis. Individual with ADHD are also 10 percentage points more likely to receive

public assistance. However, there are also differences in the family background of

individuals with ADHD. On one hand, these individuals come from more advantaged

backgrounds, as measured by maternal education and family income. On the other hand,

individuals with ADHD are also more likely to have other health problems, such as

asthma, and are also more likely to be exposed to childhood mistreatment. These

differences in family background as well as unobserved family factors will be controlled

in the analysis. Individuals with ADHD also have several co-occurring illnesses and

unhealthy behaviors—they are more likely to smoke marijuana and tobacco, drink

alcohol, and be sexually active (p-value<0.16). The empirical analysis will be able to

control for these important sources of heterogeneity.



Empirical Models

       Following much of the literature examining the associations between health and

labor market outcomes, I begin the analysis using baseline OLS regression specifications:

        Employment i ,t = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + ε it             (1)

Likewise, traditional Mincer models are used to link log(earnings) with ADHD and other

individual and family-level characteristics ( X ) (following Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok

2003, among others in examinations of the labor market effects of poor mental health):

       log(earnings ) i ,t = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + ε it          (2)

where outcomes are measured at time t (wave 4) and ADHD is reported for age of



                                                                                           9
diagnosis prior to wave 4. This temporal structure reduces concerns with reverse

causality in the estimated effects. In order to examine the potential biases from either

community (c) or family (f) level unobserved heterogeneity, the empirical models are

expanded to allow for school-of- origin fixed effects or family fixed effects for each

outcome, Yi (employment, earnings, and public assistance receipt):

         Yict = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + τ c + ε ict                                 (3)

         Yift = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + Z i β 2 + µ f + ε ift                                 (4)

where the Z vector in equation (4) is limited to individual level variables that vary within

families (e.g. gender). Estimates from equation (3) will allow common environmental

factors at the school/neighborhood level to be controlled, such as labor market

opportunities, health care options, and other factors. Then, in order to further control for

family-level factors that could affect both labor market opportunities and health status

(e.g. parental health), family fixed effects will be controlled. A comparison of (2) and (4)

will indicate whether baseline methods are driven by omitted variable bias at the family

level (Currie and Stabile, 2006; Fletcher and Wolfe, 2008). 15 Further examinations will

include additional individual level variables, including educational outcomes and co-

occurring illnesses and health behaviors to further examine potential pathways linking

ADHD and labor market outcomes as well as reduce the chances of bias due to

individual-level heterogeneity. In addition to these measures, auxiliary specifications

were estimated that included measures of hours worked per week as well as criminal




15
  It is important to note that if the ADHD diagnosis is measured with error, the use of sibling fixed effects
may exacerbate the bias associated with the measurement error. In addition spillover effects between
siblings would bias downward the estimated differences in outcomes (Fletcher and Wolfe 2008).


                                                                                                           10

available upon request.



Results

Results for Employment

            Table 3 presents baseline OLS estimates of the effects of childhood ADHD on

employment at Wave 4. Column 1 shows evidence that ADHD is associated with a 10

percentage point decrease in employment. Separating the results by gender (columns 2

and 3) suggest no differences. Separating the results by race suggests that blacks (14

points) and Hispanics (17 points) are affected to a greater extent than whites (9.5 points).

            Columns 7 and 8 show that the effect is more heavily concentrated in children

from poor (below median income) families (13 points) in comparison to children from

rich (above median income) families (4.5 points). 16 These differences by income also

occur in the other outcomes discussed below. There are many potential reasons for these

differences by family income, but data limitations (e.g. a single year of income data)

preclude a fuller examination. It is possible that children in poorer households are less

likely to receive medical (or other) treatment than those in richer households, however,

Ritalin and other drugs now prescribed for ADHD symptoms were not widely available

in the mid 1980s when the respondents were children (Woodworth 2000). More

generally, though, differences in access to health care based on family income might

produce differences in effects of childhood health. A second possibility is that,

conditional on receiving a diagnosis, children in poor households had worse symptoms

on average. In results not reported, I find no correlation between family income and

ADHD symptoms for those who are ever diagnosed. Additional analysis with data that

has information on a wider set of potential mechanisms is needed to probe these results

further.

           In order to control for measures of environmental factors (e.g. local

unemployment rates) during adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups,

controls were included for high school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 4;

however these controls do not alter the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the

baseline results for the sibling subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed

effects, again suggesting no changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are

controlled in column 5, which slightly reduces the effect on employment to 12.6

percentage points. In order to examine potential pathways through which ADHD might

affect employment, columns 6-8 add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling

and wave 3 test scores (7), and occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are

surprisingly stable 17, indicating between a 12-14 percentage point reduction in

employment for individuals with ADHD, compared with their sibling. As noted above,

these results are unchanged if controls for wave 3 criminal behavior or hours worked are

used. Overall, the effects of ADHD on adult employment appear concentrated in

disadvantaged children, are only partially explained by education and health behaviors,

and the magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to controls for several sources of

heterogeneity.



Results for Earnings


17
  All individuals with no stated occupation at wave 3 are given a separate (common) value for their
occupation code for this analysis.


                                                                                                      12
        Results for log(earnings) are presented in Tables 5 and 6. It is important to note

that these empirical models are conditional on non-zero earnings. 18 Baseline OLS results

in column 1 of Table 5 indicate a nearly 30% earnings reduction for those with childhood

ADHD. The magnitude is nearly twice the black-white earnings gap and similar to the

gender gap. Splitting the sample by gender in columns 2 and 3 shows very little

difference in effects. As before, the earnings effects of ADHD are also concentrated

among racial minorities and children from poor families.

        Again, in order to control for measures of environmental factors during

adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups, controls were included for high

school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 6; however these controls do not alter

the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the baseline results for the sibling

subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed effects, again suggesting no

changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are controlled in column 5, which

slightly increases the effect on earnings to 40% from 36% (Smith 2009 shows larger

effects of poor childhood health on income after using family fixed effects). In order to

examine potential pathways through which ADHD might affect earnings, columns 6-8

add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling and wave 3 test scores (7), and

occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are again surprisingly stable,

indicating between a 34-36% reduction in earnings for individuals with ADHD,

compared with their sibling. Overall, like employment, the effects of ADHD on adult

earnings appear concentrated in disadvantaged children, are only partially explained by

education and health behaviors, and the magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to

controls for several sources of heterogeneity.



Results for Public Assistance

       Results for public assistance receipt between waves 3 and 4 are presented in

Tables 7 and 8. Baseline OLS results in column 1 of Table 7 indicate a 13 percentage

point increase in public assistance for those with childhood ADHD. Splitting the sample

by gender in columns 2 and 3 shows larger effects for females (16 points) than males (11

points). As before, the effects of ADHD are also concentrated among racial minorities

and children from poor families (15 points) versus children from rich families (8 points).

       Again, in order to control for measures of environmental factors (e.g. local

unemployment rates) during adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups,

controls were included for high school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 8;

however these controls do not alter the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the

baseline results for the sibling subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed

effects, again suggesting no changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are

controlled in column 5, which slightly reduces the effect on public assistance from 19

points to 17 points. In order to examine potential pathways through which ADHD might

affect earnings, columns 6-8 add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling and

wave 3 test scores (7), and occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are again

surprisingly stable, indicating between a 15-17 point reduction in social assistance for

individuals with ADHD, compared with their sibling. Overall, like employment, the

effects of ADHD on adult social assistance appear concentrated in disadvantaged




                                                                                           14
children, are only partially explained by education and health behaviors, and the

magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to controls for several sources of

heterogeneity.



Examination by Age of Onset

            Tables 9-11 examine the differential effects based on whether the respondent

reported an “early” or “late” diagnosis 19, where the variables are defined based on the

median age of reported diagnosis in the sample—age 12. Table 9 shows evidence that

early ADHD reduces employment by 12-15 percentage points and that late ADHD

reduces employment by approximately 5 percentage points.

            Table 10 shows evidence that early ADHD reduces earnings by 35-45% and late

ADHD reduces earnings by 15-25% compared to individuals with no diagnosis, and the

results are relatively robust to family fixed effects and additional controls. Finally, Table

11 shows that early ADHD increases social assistance receipt by 15-20 percentage points

and late ADHD increases social assistance by 8-14 points in young adulthood. Again, the

results are relatively robust to family fixed effects and controls for individual

heterogeneity. A potential explanation for these patterns of effects is that ADHD cases

that are diagnosed early are more severe in nature, thus prompting action by the school

system or parents. These results are also consistent with Currie et al. (2010) and suggest

that early interventions that are able to reduce ADHD symptoms may be particularly

compelling.



Suggestive Robustness Check on Retrospective Reporting
19
     It is worthwhile to again note that age of diagnosis will occur later than age of onset.


                                                                                                15
         One final issue that requires additional examination is whether individual

retrospective reports on ADHD diagnosis may be clouded by “rationalization bias”

(Benitez-Silva et al. 1999), where because they have experienced trouble in the labor

market they misreport positive prior ADHD diagnosis as a way to rationalize their

outcomes. Because the ADHD diagnosis and labor market data are collected

contemporaneously, this potential reverse causality issue needs to be addressed. Thus, I

substitute the ADHD diagnosis measure from Wave 4 with a Wave 1 (occurring 15 years

prior) self report of the frequency with which the respondent had trouble paying attention

in school (never, just a few times, once a week, almost everyday, and everyday). Results

are reported in Table 12 and suggest nearly identical patterns in comparison to results

presented for ADHD diagnosis. For example, individuals reporting attention troubles

“everyday” are 8 percentage points less likely to be employed at Wave 4, face earnings

reductions of approximately 30%, and are 10 percentage points more likely to participate

in a social program. These results are robust to family fixed effects controls. While this

measure may not be precisely the same as ADHD symptoms 20, it does suggest that

retrospective reports of ADHD diagnosis are not clouded by reverse causality concerns.



Conclusions

         This paper provides the first evidence in the literature that childhood ADHD

diagnosis decreases young adult employment and earnings and provides corroborative

evidence that ADHD increases the likelihood of social assistance (Currie et al. 2010).


20
   Appendix Table A3 shows that the Wave 1 attention measure strongly predicts later ADHD diagnosis.
I also analyzed the inclusion of these Wave 1 attention measures as instruments for ADHD diagnoses in
unreported results. The results typically increased by a factor of 4-10, though the excludability of these
potential instruments was questionable, suggesting these results are biased upward.


                                                                                                             16
This evidence advances previous literature because it is less susceptible to issues of

reverse causality and also allows controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the

environmental and family levels as well as many measures of co-occurring health

outcomes and behaviors. Overall, the magnitude of the results are robust across

specifications and suggest that childhood ADHD reduces adult employment by

approximately 10 percentage points, reduces earnings by 33 percent and increases social

assistance receipt by 15 points. Further, the employment reductions appear to be

concentrated among children from disadvantaged families. The Add Health data does not

contain information on potential ADHD treatment during childhood; a reasonable

speculation might therefore place the results in this paper as lower bound estimates if

some individuals were diagnosed and successfully treated 21.

        To place the magnitude of the results into perspective, the 30% earnings reduction

associated with ADHD are as large as the within-sample, within-family gender earnings

gap (29%), the within-sample black-white earning gap (24%), the within sample, within

family earnings difference for those who report graduating college versus those who did

not (15%) and larger than the effects of low birth weight (table not shown but available

upon request). Broadening the comparison, Leigh and Gill (1997) present evidence of an

8-10 percent earnings premium associated with community college completion. Currie

and Hyson (1999) report wage reductions of between 2-4 percent associated with low

birth weight status. Fletcher (2009a) finds a 15% earnings reduction associated with

adolescent onset depression. Smith (2009) finds a 24% increase in household income for

siblings reporting good or excellent physical health up to age 16.


21
   Note also, though, that many common pharmaceutical treatments were not widely available during the
late 1980s and early 1990s, when the respondents were children and adolescents (Woodworth 2000).


                                                                                                        17
       Compared to these similar findings from related work, the associations between

childhood ADHD and adult outcomes are very large in magnitude. There are several

potential explanations of these effect sizes, but it should also be noted that additional

research is needed to replicate them in other settings before strong conclusions can be

reached. One potential partial explanation is that, in this cohort, rates of modern

treatment were likely quite low. As discussed previously, the cohorts under study grew

up at a time with much less access to ADHD treatments than presently available. As one

example, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) actively blocked the use of

methylphenidate (Ritalin) and similar drugs by classifying it as a Schedule II controlled

substance since 1971—prior to 1991 the sale of these drugs were stable and small.

However, by 1999 they had increased by almost 500% (Woodworth, 2000). The

respondents in Add Health were teenagers and young adults by 1999 (the typical age of

onset of ADHD symptoms is 7). As discussed above, childhood ADHD also persists in a

large proportion of individuals into adulthood (60%), whereas, for example, the effects of

low birth weight may be less problematic for adults (Fletcher 2011). However, again,

readers should be exercise caution in viewing results of this magnitude because they have

not been replicated yet and are so large.

       If the results are confirmed in other studies, the within-sibling associations

between earnings and childhood ADHD diagnosis are worthy of addition attention. The

results could be relevant along several dimensions. First, the results suggest that

childhood ADHD may be an important determinant of labor market outcomes, with

potentially important differences in effects by family background. Increasing our

understanding of labor market outcomes may allow additional policies to be suggested to




                                                                                            18
increase labor force participation and productivity, which could have long term

implications for important life outcomes such as income and wealth accumulation,

occupation, and adult population health. Second, the results suggest that interventions

that successfully reduce ADHD symptoms during childhood may have downstream

benefits that may not be comprehensively measured in many cost-benefit analyses and

suggest that further interventions may be desirable. Increases in treatment options,

particularly during early childhood, may provide substantial long term benefits in terms

of future labor productivity.
