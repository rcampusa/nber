     ThIspaper presents a comparative analysis of productivity growth in the
U.S. and Japanese electrical machinery Industries in the postwar period. This
industry has experienced rapid growth in output and productivity and high rates
of capital formation in both countries. A substantial amount of R&D resources
of the total manufacturing sectors in both countries is concentrated In the
electrical machinery Industry. Also, this industry has an active export orien-
tation in both countries.

    The analysis of the paper is based on dynamic factor demand models
describing the production structure and the behavior of factor inputs as well as
the determinants of productivity growth in the U.S. and Japanese electrical
machinery Industry. The analysis shows that the production structure of the
industry in both countries is characterized by increasing returns to scale; the
factors of production do respond to changes In factor prices; and the existence
of a pattern of substitution and complenientarity among the inputs. The main
sources of productivity growth are: growth in materials; technical change; and
capital accumulation. R&D expenditures have also contributed significantly to
growth of labor and productivity while the most important source of total factor
productivity in this industry for both countries has been the scale effect
followed by changes in technical progress.

 I.    Introduction1

       During the 1970's the growth rates of labor productivity in the Japanese

 manufacturing sector dramatically exceeded those in the United States,

 particularly in such key industries as primary metals, chemicals, electrical

 machinery   and transportation equipment. This enabled   the Japanese   to reach
 and eventually surpass levels of U.S. labor productivity in these industries
 (Grossman (1985)). Although each of these industries is a key competitor to
 the U.S. high technology industries in both the U.S. domestic and in the world
market, the electrical machinery industry stands out In certain respects. It
has experienced very rapid growth In output and productivity and high rates of
capital formation both in the U.S. and Japan. Also, a substantial amount of
R&D resources - over 20% of total R&D expenditures in total manufacturing — Is
concentrated in this industry In both countries. Furthermore, Japan has
increased its share of free world export in electrical machinery from 22% in
1971 to 148% in 1981 as well as dramatically increased its share of U.S.
imports of electrical machinery products over the same period (Grossman
(1985)).
      Because of these characteristics, we have chosen to examine   the

productivity  performance of this Industry In the U.S. and Japan. The analysis
is based on a dynamic factor demand model. Since output growth has been
fairly high in the electrical machinery industry both in the U.S. and Japan,
we have not imposed a priori constant returns to scale. Returns to scale are
estimated from the data. Furthermore, we allow some of the input factors to
be quasi—fixed and model adjustment costs explicitly. Since the rate of R&D
investment in the electrical machinery industry has been very rapid, we have
also incorporated R&D explicitly as one of the inputs. Other factor inputs
considered are labor (hours worked), materials and capital. Using the
                                            —2--



structural parameter estimates, we analyze the sources of growth in output,
labor productivity    and total factor productivity.

      The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we provide a brief

description of the behavior of productivity growth as well as inputs and

output   growth   in the electrical machinery industries of the U.S. and Japan.
Section III describes the properties and structure of our analytical model.
In Section IV we describe the results obtained by estimating the model using
annual data. We report output and price elasticities of the variable and
quasi-fixed factors of production in the short, intermediate and long—run and
calculate the speeds of adjustment of the quasi—fixed factors — physical and
R&D capital. Section V is devoted to the examining the sources of output and
factor productivity growth rates. This analysis is based on our estimates of
the production technology. Summary and conclusions are offered in Section VI.
The data description is     contained   in an appendix.

II.   Some Descriptive Characteristics

      In this section, we provide a brief description of total and           partial
factor productivity growth and     the growth of      gross   output, labor, materials,
capital and R&D in the electrical machinery industry for the perIods 1968—73
and 1 971479• We refer to these periods as the pre—OPEC and post—OPEC periods,
respectively.
     Average growth rates for gross output and factor inputs for the two
periods are given in Table 1. For the pre—OPEC period the growth rates were
extremely high for Japan in comparison to the U.S. However, in the post-OPEC
period, the Japanese electrical machinery industry experienced a substantial
drop in rates of growth of output and of most inputs.             For example, the
average output growth rate declined from 1 6.9% to 6.4% for Japan while
increasing from 14.2% to Q9% in the U.S.           Still, the level of output growth

 rates for the Japanese industry remained high compared to the U.S. industry.
 The average growth rate of capital over the period 1968—73 was twice as high
 in Japan as in the U.S. even though the U.S. industry experienced a healthy
5.14% per annum growth rate over this period. However, Japan's rate of growth
in capital formation decelerated by more than 140% after 1973. Materials input
grew much faster in Japan than in the U.S. in the pre-OPEC period, but again
Japan experienced a dramatic slowdown in the growth rate of this input during
the second period.
     As indicated in Table 1 the R&D stock grew at a much more rapid rate in
Japan than in the U.S. in both periods, reflecting the very high rate of
growth in R&D investment in Japan. In both the U.S. and Japanese electrical
machinery industries the growth in the stock of R&D slowed down in the 19714-79
period.
     The growth rate of labor measured in hours worked shows a dramatically
different pattern in the two countries since 1973. It increased from —0.5% in
1968—73 to 1.14% in 19714—79 in the U.S. while in Japan the growth in this input
declined from 14.3% to an actual reduction of -      2.5%.    This phenomenon is
consistent    with the general pattern of employment     in   the two countries: Japan
experienced   declines in employment in several industries while the U.S.
                                                —14--




experienced    increases in employment in most industries (Griliches and Mairesse
(1985) and Norsworthy and Malmquist (1983)).
      As demonstrated by Table 2, an important characteristic of the electrical
machinery     industry in both countries is the high              ratio   of R&D investment in

output. While the ratio of capital investment in value added or gross                         output
in this industry is generally lower than in total manufacturing, the opposite

is true for R&D    investment.    The R&D   ratios          in the electrical machinery

industry are two to three times as large as those in total manufacturing. It

is also important to note that in the U.S. electrical machinery industry the

R&D investment ratios are considerably higher than the capital investment

ratios while the opposite is true in Japan.
     Total and partial productivity growth rates based on a gross output
measurement framework are shown in Table 3. Both total arid labor productivity

growth rates were much higher in the Japanese electrical machinery industry
than in the U.S.2 This was particularly true in the pre—OPEC period. Unlike
the aggregate manufacturing sector (Norsworthy and Malmquist (1983)), total
factor productivity was       rising    in this industry in the two countries over the
two   periods. The differences in the growth of labor productivity in the

industries of the two countries are substantial. In the U.S. labor

productivity grew about 14.7%      in   1968—73 and declined to 3.5% in 19714—79; in

Japan the corresponding growth rates are                1   2.6 and 8.9, respectively.

Substantial improvements in materials productivity in this industry                      in   both

countries in the post—OPEC period are           also        noted.

      Thus,    the elements of'   the so—called Japanese productivity "miracle" can

also be observed in the electrical machinery industry: High rates of labor

productivity growth accompanied by rapid growth rates of output, an other

inputs   such as materials,    capital    and   R&D before 1973 and diminishing           but

still very high rates of labor                 productivity growth after 1973               accompanied by a
substantial fall—off in the growth rates of output and other inputs. To
explore the reasons for these productivity patterns, we proceed to estimate
the production structure of the electrical machinery industry of the two
countries.

III.      Model Specification

          Consider a firm that employs two variable inputs and        two   quasi-fixed

inputs      in producing a single output from a technology with internal adjustment
costs.       Specifically, assume the firm's production function takes the form:

(1)               =
                      F(Vt,Xt_i,Xt,Tt)
where          denotes gross output, V [Vit,V2t]' is the vector of variable

                                                        stocks of the quasi—
inputs, X =   [Xit,X2t]' is the vector of end—of—period
fixed inputs and Tt is an exogenous technology index. The vector
      —                     the internal adjustment costs in terms of forgone output.
X         X_1 represents
          The firm's input markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive. It

proves      convenient to describe the firm's technology in terms of the normalized
restricted cost function defined as G(Wt,Xti,Xt,Yt,Tt) =               it    +
                                                                                 WV2.     Here

          and V2 represent the cost—minimizing amounts of variable inputs needed to
produce the output 't conditional on      and     and   denotes the price of
    normalized by the price of V1. The following properties of the
normalized restricted cost function follow from Lau (1976): Gx < 0,
                                                                             3

Gx>         0, Gy > 0, G > 0;    furthermore G(•) is convex in           and         and concave in
  3
wt.
           Given the presence of large firms in the electrical machinery industries of

both       the U.S. and Japan we do not impose a        priori constant returns to scale.

Rather,       we allow the technology to be homogeneous        of (constant)     degree p and
determine p       from   the data.3   Results   from 1adiri and Prucha (1984) imply that if
F() is       homogeneous   of degree p, the corresponding normalized restricted cost
function is of the form:

 (2)               G(Wt,Xti,Xt,Yt,Tt)
                                           =
                                                G[Wt,
                                                        yt   /p'     Tt]Ytl/P.
                                                                       —7--



         the empirical analysis, we take labor (hours worked), L, and
        In

 materials, 'M, as the variable factors and the stocks of capital, K, and

 research and development., R, as the quasi—fixed factors. We adopt the
 convention V L, V2                            W is the real wage rate; the
                                           M, X1 =           K and X2 = R;

 price of materials is the nuineraire. We specify the following functional form
 for the normalized resricted cost function:

 (3)          G(Wt,Xti,Xt,Yt,Tt)                         =
                                                             [a0   +

       In light of the above discussion, we can view (3) as a second order

approximation to a general normalized restricted cost function that

corresponds to a homogeneous technology of degree p. Expression (3)                                               is   a
generalization        of the normalized restricted cost function introduced by Denny,
Fuss and     Waverman            (1981) and      Morrison and Berndt                (1981) for linear homogeneous
technologies. Nadiri and                   Prucha            (1 98'U have generalized that function to
homothetic     technologies. As in these references we impose                                         parameter

       We assume that in each period                 t,   for given initial stocks X_1, the firm

derives an optima-i input path such that the present value of the future cost

stream is minimized and chooses the inputs in period t accordingly. We also

assume static expectations on relative factor prices, output and the

technology. Accordingly, the firm's optimum problem in period t can be

 definite. Unless                    we impose separability in the        quasi—fixed factors, i.e.
 aKR      0   which implies mKfl                      0, (7) cannot generally be solved for M in terms

                                      MY1.         Since the real discount rate r was assumed to be

 constant, M is constant over the sample. Hence, instead of

 elements     of    A and B we a may                  estimate those of M and                B.    Such a

 reparameterization                   was first suggested by Epstein and                      Yatchew    (1985) for a
 somewhat     different model with a similar algebra.                                    Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha
 (1985) used such a reparameterjza within the context of a constant

to scale model. To impose the symmetry of C we can also estimate B and C

instead of B and M. Let D                                                      =   —MA and observe that A =

 is given in the appendix. The data on gross output, materials, labor, capital
 and   R&D are in   constant 1 972 dollars and        been normalized by their

 respective sample means. Prices were constructed conformably. Expectations
 on gross output were calculated as follows. We first estimate a first order
 AR process for output which is then used to predict Y rationally. We employed
 the full information maximum likelihood estimation method and, when necessary,
corrected for first order autocorrelation of the disturbances. We used TSP as
the estimation package.

demand equations seem to fit the data quite well. (Fitted values are

calculated from the reduced form). For both the U.S. and Japan the squared

correlation   coefficient is   somewhat low for the labor demand equation. The

parameter   estimates are, in general, statistically siiificant. For both the
U.S. and Japan, the parameter estimates satisfy the theoretical restrictions.

In   particular, the estimates for c, 0RR and            are negative and those for
          and (cKKcRR —
                        CKR)    are positive. The variables underlying the
estimates for the U.S. and         electrical machinery industry are, as
                               Japanese

explained above, measured in different units. Hence, a direct comparison of
individual parameter estimates is difficult. However, we do calculate various
unit—free characteristics that allow a meaningful comparison.

      In   general the adjustment cost coefficients            and        are significantly

 different from zero. They determine crucially the investment patterns of the

 quasi—fixed factors via the accelerator coefficients. Omitting those terms

 would not only have resulted in amipecification of the investment patterns
 but also (in general) in inconsistent estimates of the other technology
parameters. Table 5    shows the estimates for the accelerator coefficients

significantly different from zero at the 95        percent level. In           describing the

adjustment speed, we can therefore concentrate          on the own-adjustment
coefficients mKK and mRR. As a      first observation we note that the obtained

estimates   are quite similar across countries. For both the U.S. and Japanese
industries capital adjusts faster than R&D. While capital closes
approximately one fourth of the gap between the initial and              the   desired stock
in the first period,   R&D only   closes approximately one seventh of its gap. We
note that those adjustment speeds are consistent with earlier results obtained
by Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha (1985) f or the total manufacturing sectors of the
two countries.
    As remarked earlier, our specification         does not impose a priori constant

returns to scale. Rather we estimate the scale elasticity (represented by p)

from the data. For both countries, we find substantial and significant scale

effects in the industry. For the U.S., our estimate for the scale elasticity

is 1.21; for Japan we obtained a considerably higher estimate of 1.39. As we

will translate into substantial differences in productivity growth. It is

also interesting to note that, contrary to our finding of increasing returns

to scale at the industry level, Griliches and Mairesse (1985) find decreasing

returns to scale in the U.S. and Japanese total manufacturing sectors at the

firm    level.

IV.2    Price and aitput Elasticities

        The own— and cross—price elasticities of labor, materials, capital and

R&D for 1976     are   reported in Table 6. The elasticities        are calculated for the
short    (SR), intermediate (IR) and long—run (LR) for the each input for the

electrical machinery industry in both Japan and the U.S.5 All of the own-

price elasticities have the expected negative sign. The magnitudes of the

elasticities are fairly similar between the two countries.              In the    U.S. the

own—price elasticity of labor is the largest among the inputs followed by

materials, R&D stock and capital stock. In           Japan,   with minor exceptions, the

same   pattern holds; the quasi—fixed inputs, capital and R&D,     seem   to have a
higher own—price elasticity in the Japanese than in the U.S. electrical
machinery industry.      These results are   similar to those reported for the total
manufacturing sectors     of the United States and Japan    in Mohnen, Nadiri   and

Prucha (1985).
       Although   the cross—price elasticities are generally small in comparison
to own—price elasticities, some of the elasticities are sizable. The
elasticities of materials and R&D with respect to the wage rate, and the
elasticities of labor, R&D, and capital Inputs with respect to materials
prices are quite large in both countries. Materials are substitutes for other
inputs, except for R&D the U.S.. Labor and R&D are substitutes in the U.S
and weak complements in the Japanese electrical machinery industry. Labor and
capital and   capital   and R&D are complements in both countries.
       The output   elasticities of the inputs for 1976 are shown in Table 7. The

long—run elasticities of   the inputs are .8 and .7, respectively, for the        U.S.

and    Japan implying fairly sizable economies of scale. The results are
consistent with Fuss and Waverman (1985), NadIrl and Prucha (19814) and Nadiri
and Schankerman (1981). The patterns of the output elasticities, particularly
in the U.S., indicate that the variable factors of production, labor and
materials. resoond strongly in the short—run to changes in output. The reason
is, that bcth labor and materials in the U.S. and materials in Japan overshoot
their long run equilibrium values in the short—run to compensate for the
sluggish adjustments of the quasi-fixed factors. They slowly adjust toward
their long—run equilibrium values as capital and R&D adjust. The output
elasticities      of capital and R&D are   small th the short-run but increase over
time    and are quite similar. At least in the short and intermediate runs the

substantiallyexceed their own—price elasticities. Surprisingly, except for
the labor input, the patterns of input responses are similar in both
countries.
     Thus, the production structure of the electrical machinery industry in
the two countries, characterized by the patterns of factor input substitution
and complementarity as well as the degree of scale, is qualitatively similar.
Quantitatively there are some differences in scale and in the responses of
inputs to changes In prices and output in the two industries. Both industries

are characterized by increasing returns to scale. However, the Japanese

industry    has a higher scale which substantially influences its            productivity
growth.

        Using the estimates of the production structure, we can quantitatively

examine the sources of output and productivity              growth. The   contributions of

the    factor inputs, technical change, and     adjustment   costs to output growth      are

shown in Table 8. The decomposition is based on the approximation:

denote the respective output elasticities and PGYt =             (1/Y)(aF/t)   denotes

technical change. The output elasticities are computed from the structural

parameter    estimates of   the restricted cost function using standard duality

theory.     For both variable and quasi—fixed factors those output elasticities
exceed long run cost shares because of increasing returns to scale. For the
quasi-fixed factors there is an additional element due to the adjustment
costs. The contribution of each of the variables in (10) is calculated by
multiplying the respective (average) elasticities with the growth rate of the
corresponding variable.
        As shown in Table 8 the average growth rate of gross output was very
rapid in Japan in the period 1 968—73 but growth decelerated substantially in
the period 19714—79.        For the U.S., output growth rates were similar In the
two periods. The contributions of various inputs to the growth of output
differ considerably between the two periods and the two industries. The most
significant source of gross output growth is the materials growth,
particularly in Japan. The contribution of' capital is larger in Japan than in
the U.S. but falls in both countries over the post—OPEC period. The R&D stock
contributes    significantly to the growth of output in both         industries. In the
post-OPEC period its contribution falls in the U.S. but remains the same for
Japan. The large contribution of R&D to the output growth may come as a
surprise, but can     be explained   by two factors. First, the share          of R&D

investment    in   gross output, as noted earlier, is very high in the electrical

machinery    industry of both countries; second, the marginal productivity of
R&D, because of the relative larger adjustment costs and the considerable
degree of scale, is fairly large in the two Industries. The direct
contributions of the adjustment costs are fairly small, as one would expect.
The contribution of technical change is clearly important in explaining the
growth of output in both industries. Its contribution is twice as large in
Japan as In the U.S.

where p is the scale elasticity. This approximation is readily obtained from

(1 0) by noting that the sum of the output elasticities must equal scale. In

the decomposition of labor productivity, the most siificant contribution

again stems from the growth           of   materials, particularly in Japan. The

contribution of physical capital is important. In comparison to the results
reported by Norsworthy and Malmquist (1983) for the total manufacturing
sector, its contribution is somewhat larger for the U.S. but substantially
 smaller for Japan. The contribution of R&D                   is     somewhat smaller and rising for
                                              —21 —




Japan.    For the U.S. the contribution of R&D is very substantial in the             pre—
OPEC period but only marginal in the post-OPEC period. The direct
contribution of adjustment cost is again small. The         contribution of technical

change is very substantial (in particular in Japan) and rising in both
countries. The last term on the R.H.S. of (11) follows from the fact that
scale is not equal to one. The contribution of this term to labor
productivity is shown in the second column of Table 9. Its effect               is positive

in   Japan in the pre—OPEC period and negative in the post-OPEC period. The
opposite is the case for the U.S.. This reflects the growth pattern of the
labor input in the two industries over the two periods.
       Denny, Fuss, Waverman (1981) have shown that if all factors are variable
the traditional measure of total factor productivity (using cost shares)

can be decomposed into two components: One attributable to scale and one to

technical    change. A similar decomposition exists for our        cost   of   adjustment

technology   (Nadiri and   Prucha (1 984)).   In particular, we can       decompose   the
Tornquist    approximation of total factor productivity as:


(12)           TFPt =    (1-p)logY       +
                                              (PGX + POXt_i)   +
                                                                   1t 2t
                                                                      +



where POX = (1/p)PGY.      The first term on the R.H.S. of (12) represents the

scale effect and the second term the effect of technical change on the growth

of total factor productivity. The term            is attributable to the fact that in

short-run temporary equilibrium, the rate of technical substitution between

the quasi—fixed and variable factors differs from the long run price ratios.

We will refer to        as the temporary equilibrium effect. The term 2 reflects

the direct adjustment cost effect in terms of forgone output due to the

presence of K and R in the production function. We will refer to 2 as the

direct adjustment cost effect. The exact expressions for             and 2 are given
in Nadiri and Prucha (19814).

     Table 10    presents the decomposition of total factor productivity based on
(1 2) for the sample periods used in estimating the production technology of
the U.S. and Japanese electrical machinery. The scale effect is, by far, the
most important contributor to total factor productivity growth. This is
particularly the case in the Japanese industry where the output growth was
very rapid and the estimated degree of' scale is larger than in the U.S.
industry. The temporary equilibrium effect, , is fairly large in the U.S.
and about twice as big as in the Japanese electrical machinery industry. The


'
direct effect of the adjustment costs, 2' is negligible. The combined effect
        and   2 due to the adjustment costs is 15 and 14 percent of the measured
total factor productivity for the U.S. and Japan, respectively, and hence not
negligible in particular for the U.S. Consequently, if zero adjustment costs
would have been imposed a nonnegligible portion of measured total factors

productivity would have been misclassified. In addition, inconsistency of the

estimates of the underlying technology parameters would have distorted the

decomposition of total factor productivity.         The contribution of technical
                                                     —23-


  change      to the growth of        productivity is second only to the
                                 tocal factor

  scale effect. For each of the sample periods the unexplained residual is
 small.


 VI.      Conclusion and Summary

         In   this paper, we have modeled the production        structure   and,   the behavior
 of factor inputs, and analyze the determinants
                                                            of productivity growth in the
 U.S.   and Japanese
                  electrical machinery industry. These industries have
 experienced a very high rate of growth of output, are technologically very
progressive (measured by the rate of expenditures on R&D) and are highly
competitive in the domestic U.S. and in the world markets. Our model allows
for     scale effects and the quasi—fixity of some of the input factors. It also

incorporates R&D to capture the high technology feature of the industry.

Other inputs considered are labor, materials and physical capital. We have

also allowed for exogenous technical
                                             change using a time trend. The model was
estimated using annual data from 1960—1980 and 1968—1980 for the U.S. and

Japan, respectively.

        The main results of this paper can be summarized as follows:

(i)     The production structure of    the   electrical machinery industry in both
  countries      is characterized by increasing        returns to scale; the Japanese
  electrical
            machinery industry exhibits higher returns to scale than the U.S.
 industry. The responses of the factors of production to changes in factor
 prices and output in the short, intermediate and long-run are similar.
 Materials are found to be generally substitutes for other inputs. Other
 inputs are generally complements except for labor and R&D in the U.S.
 industry. Capital and       R&D   are found    to   be quasi—fixed and their adjustment
 speeds are found to be similar across countries. The stock of capital
 adjusts much faster than the stock of R&D.
                                              —2 —




(ii)   The elements of the so—called Japanese productivity miracle noted by

  others are, to a large extent, present in the electrical machinery industry:

  High rates of labor productivity growth accompanied by rapid output growth

  and   input   growth before 1973   and   diminishing but still high rates of labor

  productivity    after 1 973 accompanied by a substantial slowdown in the growth
  rates of output and factor inputs.
(iii) Based on the structural estimates of our model, we identify the
  following sources of growth of output and labor productivity:
  a)   The most important source of output and labor productivity growth is
  the growth of materials for both pre-OPEC and post-OPEC periods in both
  countries. Technical change and capital were found to be the next most
  important factors. For the U.S., capital's contribution exceeds that found
  at the total manufacturing level; the reverse is true for Japan.
  b)   Consistent with the high ratio of R&D expenditures to gross output in
  the electrical machinery industry, we find significant contributions of
  R&D to both output and labor productivity growth.
(iv)      The most important source of growth in total factor productivity for
  both countries is the scale effect. This is particularly true in Japan due
  to the higher scale elasticity and higher rate of growth of output.
  Technical change is the second most important contributor. In the context
   of our dynamic model the rate of technical substitution for the quasi—fixed
   factors deviates in the short—run from the        long—run relative price ratios.

   This   source also explains part of the traditional measure of total factor
   productivity.
                                               —25—



     Our model provides a richer framework for the analysis of productivity
 growth than some of the conventional approaches by incorporating dynamic
 aspects, nonconstant returns to scale, and R&D. The omission of dynamic
 aspects will typically result in inconsistent estimates of the technology
 parameters and a misallocation in the decomposition of total factors
 productivity growth. However, a number of issues remain unresolved:
 (i)   Given the rapid expansion of the electrical machinery industries in the
   U.S. and Japan, it seems important to explore the effect of nonstatic
   expectations on the input behavior and its implications for productivity
   growth analysis.
(ii)     It may also be of interest to explore a more general lag structure for
  the quasi—fixed factors and to adopt a more general formulation of the model
  that allows for scale to vary over the sample period.
(iii) A further area of research is the decomposition of labor into white and
  blue   collar workers and   the   modeling of white collar workers as potentially

  quasi—fixed. The quasi—f ixity      of   labor may be particularly important in

  Japan where employment is considered fairly long-term.

(iv)     Finally, an important extension of the model would be to incorporate

  explicitly   the role of   demand and thereby analyse the role of the
  utilisation   rate on productivity growth.

Appendix:    Data Sources and Construction of Variables

                       U.S. Electrical Machinery Industry

Gross   Oitput: Data on gross output in current and constant   1 972 dollars   were
obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Analysis,
(OBA) database and correspond to the gross output series of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industrial Economics (BIE). Gross output is
defined as total shipments plus the net change in work in process inventories
and finished goods inventories.

Labor: Total hours worked were derived as the sum of hours worked by
production workers and nonproduction workers. Hours worked by production
workers were obtained directly from the OBA database. Hours worked by
nonproduction workers were calculated as the number of nonproductiori workers *
hours   worked per week * 52. The number of nonproduction workers was obtained
from the OBA database. Weekly hours worked of nonproduction workers were
taken to be 39.7. A series for total compensation in current dollars was
calculated by multiplying the total payroll series from the OBA database with
the ratio of compensation of employees to wages and salaries from U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (1981, 1984).

Materials: Materials in current dollars were obtained from the OBA database.
Materials in constant 1 972 dollars were calculated using deflators provided by
the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of' Economic Analysis.


Value Added: Value added in current and constant 1972 dollars was calculated
by subtracting materials frcn gross output.
                                               —27—




  Capital:    The net capital stock series in 1972 dollars and           the   current and
  constant    1972 dollars gross investment series were taken from the OBA
  database.    The method by   which   the capital   stock series   is constructed     is

 described in U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (1979). The
 user cost of capital was constructed as               qK(r   +
                                                                  6K11
                                                                         —
                                                                             u) where qK =
 investment deflator, cSK      depreciation rate of the capital stock, u =
 corporate    tax rate and r     0.05.

 R&D: The stock of total R&D is constructed by the perpetual inventory method
 with a depreciation rate 6 .1. The benchmark in 1958 is obtained by
 dividing total R&D expenditures by the depreciation rate and the growth rate
 in real value added. The nominal R&D expenditures are taken from National
Science Foundation (198)4) and earlier issues. To avoid double counting we
have subtracted the labor and material components of R&D from the labor and
materials inputs. The GDP deflator for total manufacturing is used as a
deflator for R&D.


All constant dollars variables were normalized by respective sample means.
Prices were constructed confonnably.

Gross aztput: For the period 1970—1980 the data series on gross output in
current and constant 1975 yen were obtained from Economic Planning Agency
(19814). The data for the period before 1 970 were constructed by connecting
these series with the corresponding series reported in Economic Planning
Agency (1980) via identical growth rates.
                                            —28--




Labor: Total hours worked were calculated as total numbers of employees              *

monthly hours worked * 12.     For the period 1970—1980 the number of employees
was taken from Economic Planning Agency (19814). For the period before 1970
the number of employees was calculated by connecting this series with the
employment index provided by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). Monthly
hours worked for the period 1 977—i 980 were obtained from Statistics Bureau
(1985). For previous years monthly hours worked were calculated by using the
monthly hours work index provided by EPA. For the period 1970-1980 total
compensation is reported in Economic Planning Agency (19814). For the period
before 1970 total compensation was calculated by connecting this series with
an index on cash earnings provided by EPA.

Value Added: For the period 1 970-1 980 data on value added in current and
constant   1975 yen were obtained from     Economic Planning Agency (1984). The
data for the period before 1970 were obtained by connecting these series with
the    corresponding series reported in Economic Planning        Agency (1975) via
identical growth rates.

Materials: Materials in current and constant 1975 yen were calculated as the
difference   between gross   output   and value added.


Capital Stock: Data for the stock of capital and         gross   investment in 1975 yen

were taken from Economic Planning Agency (1985). A series for current dollar

gross investment was     obtained   from the Japanese Ministry of Finance. This

series was   adjusted   such that it coincided with the constant      yen   EPA series in

1975.    The user cost of capital was constructed analogously to that for the

U.S.
                                        -29-


R&D: Current yen R&D expenditures are taken from OECD (1983) and earlier
issues. To avoid double counting we have subtracted the labor and
material component of R&D from the labor and material inputs. The GDP
deflator for total manufacturing is used as the deflator for R&D. The
stock of R&D is constructed analogously to that for the U.S. with 1965 as
the benchmark year.

A.1l constant yen variables were transformed to a 1972 base and than normalized
by respective sample means. Prices were constructed confonnably.

      total     factor productivity growth rates is much more pronounced in a value
