On Money as a Medium of Exchange in Near-Cashless Credit Economies

                                         ABSTRACT

We study the transmission of monetary policy in credit economies where money serves as a
medium of exchange. We find that—in contrast to current conventional wisdom in policy-
oriented research in monetary economics—the role of money in transactions can be a powerful
conduit to asset prices and ultimately, aggregate consumption, investment, output, and welfare.
Theoretically, we show that the cashless limit of the monetary equilibrium (as the cash-and-credit
economy converges to a pure-credit economy) need not correspond to the equilibrium of the
nonmonetary pure-credit economy. Quantitatively, we find that the magnitudes of the responses
of prices and allocations to monetary policy in the monetary economy are sizeable—even in the
cashless limit. Hence, as tools to assess the effects of monetary policy, monetary models without
money are generically poor approximations—even to idealized highly developed credit
economies that are able to accommodate a large volume of transactions with arbitrarily small
aggregate real money balances.

1    Introduction

A large body of work in macroeconomics rests on the premise that artificial economies without
money are well suited to study the effects of monetary policy. In fact, most of the work
in modern monetary economics that caters to policymakers, abstracts from the usefulness of
money altogether: there is typically no money in the models, or if there is money, it is merely
held as a redundant asset. What underlies this moneyless approach to monetary economics is
the received wisdom that the medium-of-exchange role of money is quantitatively irrelevant in
the transmission of monetary policy.
    The intuitive argument runs as follows: aggregate real money balances are a small fraction
of aggregate real output in modern economies (e.g., inverse velocity of the monetary base tends
to be relatively small), so policy induced changes in real money balances are bound to have very
small effects on output. Therefore, the argument goes, the traditional monetarist mechanism
whereby changes in monetary policy are transmitted to the economy through changes in real
money balances is basically irrelevant, and there is no significant loss in basing monetary policy
advise on models where real money balances do not interact with the real allocation—or are
simply assumed to be equal to zero.
    This intuition has been formalized in the context of economies where the role of money
in exchange is not modeled explicitly, but rather, is proxied by either assuming money is an
argument of a utility function, or by imposing that certain purchases be paid for with cash
acquired in advance. There are two ways in which these reduced-form models have been used
to support the claim that medium-of-exchange considerations can be safely ignored.
    First, the fact that the monetary equilibrium in these reduced-form models is continuous
under a certain “cashless limit” (e.g., obtained by taking to zero either the marginal utility of
real balances in a model where money enters the utility function, or the fraction of “cash goods”
in a cash-credit goods version of a cash-in-advance model where money becomes a redundant
asset) has been used to conclude that a monetary economy with an inverse velocity that is
as small as in the data can be well approximated by an economy where real money balances
are simply assumed to play no role in monetary transmission—an economy without money,
for instance. Second, parametrized versions of these reduced-form models have been used to
claim that for realistic values of inverse velocity, the quantitative relevance of real balances in
monetary transmission is insignificant.



                                                2
   In this paper we show that when the trading frictions that make money useful in exchange are
modeled explicitly, the medium-of-exchange role of money is a significant and resilient channel
for the transmission of monetary policy. Specifically, we show that the two formal arguments
that have been put forward to justify and encourage the use of models without money to
study monetary policy, are overturned when we replace the reduced-form formulations with
more primitive micro foundations. First, we show that along the cashless limit, the prices and
allocations in the monetary equilibrium (as the cash-and-credit economy converges to a pure-
credit economy) need not converge to the prices and allocations of the economy without money.
So as a matter of pure theory, it would be incorrect to regard the economy with no money
as an arbitrarily good approximation to an economy where credit has developed sufficiently to
render equilibrium aggregate real balances negligible. Second, we show that this discontinuity
is quantitatively significant: the effects of monetary policy in the explicit medium-of-exchange
economy remain large even as aggregate real balances converge to zero along the cashless limit.
The key insight is that along the cashless limit, even as the volume of transactions financed
with cash converges to zero, individual investors always have the option to trade with cash,
so the market price in this vanishing volume of cash transactions feeds back into the terms of
trade negotiated in non-cash pure-credit transactions. We show that this logic applies as long
as credit markets are not perfectly frictionless, in the sense that there exists some limit to how
much an individual can borrow, and credit-market intermediaries have some market power.
   An important mechanism underlying our results for near-cashless economies is that the
mere existence of some valued money influences the terms of trade in credit transactions that
may or not involve money. The fact that traders’ asset holdings affect the terms of trade in a
bilateral bargain is commonplace in models of decentralized exchange. The mechanism arises
naturally in models of over-the-counter trade with unrestricted asset holdings such as Afonso
and Lagos (2015). In the search-based monetary literature there are also environments where
money confers a strategic bargaining advantage to the agent who holds it. In Zhu and Wallace
(2007), for example, the mechanism is embedded in the bargaining protocol, according to which
holding money is akin to having more bargaining power. A more recent example is Rocheteau
et al. (2018), where holding money improves a borrower’s outside option in the bilateral bargain
for a loan. Since in their model this outside option is an increasing function of the borrower’s
real balances, this mechanism offers a theory for the passthrough from the nominal policy
interest rate to the real borrowing rate that the money holder has to pay for the loan. Agents


                                                3
in our model encounter some trading situations that exhibit a similar mechanism, but these
particular trading situations are not the relevant ones for our main results. What prevents
the medium-of-exchange transmission mechanism from dissipating in near-cashless economies
is the fact that money affects the terms of trade in transactions that do not involve money. The
reason is that the option to engage in monetary trade can improve the bargaining position of
an investor when he negotiates with a financial intermediary, even though neither the investor
nor the intermediary holds money nor wishes to hold money.
       Another angle on our results, is that the option to engage in monetary trade disciplines
the market power that financial intermediaries can exert over investors—even in trades that do
not involve money. Along a cashless limit, the aggregate volume of monetary trade vanishes,
but the individual off-equilibrium option to engage in monetary trade remains available and
credible. Therefore, it would be incorrect to infer that money cannot matter quantitatively
simply based on the observation that it accounts for a small share of transactions. At a general
level, our results are an application to Monetary Theory of the simple idea that credible outside
options can drive outcomes even if they are not exercised in equilibrium. This idea is of course
ubiquitous in Economics. In Macroeconomics, it is a key equilibrium driving force in models
with private information. In International Economics and Industrial Organization, the notion
that the option to engage in trade—even if no trade actually occurs—can be a key determinant
of equilibrium outcomes and welfare goes back many years.1
       The basic structure of our model builds on Lagos and Wright (2005). The particular mar-
ketstructure is similar to the one we have used in Lagos and Zhang (2015, 2019), which in turn
adopts some elements from Duffie et al. (2005). The major difference with Lagos and Zhang
(2015, 2019) is that here we allow investors to buy assets on margin. Aside from capturing an
important aspect of trade in financial markets, credit is essential to study the role of monetary
policy in near-cashless economies, which is the goal of this paper.
   1
     This is the key idea behind the famous breakdown of the equivalence of tariffs and quotas under imperfect
competition in Bhagwati (1965), and underlying the notion of contestable markets in Baumol (1982). Another
well known example in Trade Theory is Markusen (1981), who considers two identical countries with a monopolist
producer in each. Under autarky, the equilibrium has a monopoly mark-up in each country, but if trade between
the countries is possible, competition turns the two monopolists into Cournot duopolists, which reduces markups
and increases welfare in both countries even though no trade actually occurs (since the countries are identical).
Along these lines, Salvo (2010) provides evidence from Brazilian cement markets that import prices play a key
role in determining domestic cement prices, despite the near absence of imports. Holmes et al. (2014) emphasize
that since the threat of imports can, through the effect on mark-ups, impact resource allocation across domestic
firms, the welfare gains from international trade can be large even if the observed volume of trade is small, or
even zero.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model. Equilib-
rium is characterized in Section 3. Section 4 presents the theoretical results for the cashless limit.
Section 5 develops two extensions. The first illustrates the relevance of the medium-of-exchange
transmission mechanism of monetary policy for aggregate variables such as consumption and
investment. The second explores the robustness of the main results to alternative credit ar-
rangements. Section 6 studies efficiency and welfare. Section 7 proves results for the effects
of monetary policy on asset prices and real macro aggregates. Section 8 conducts quantitative
theoretical exercises designed to gauge the magnitude and empirical relevance of the medium-
of-exchange transmission mechanism. Section 9 places our contribution in the context of the
existing literature on monetary economics without money. Section 10 concludes. Appendix A
contains all proofs. Appendix B contains robustness checks for the quantitative results.


2     Model
2.1   Environment

Time is represented by a sequence of periods indexed by t = 0, 1, .... Each time period is divided
into two subperiods where different activities take place. There is a continuum of infinitely lived
investors, each identified with a point in the set I = [0, NI ], with NI ∈ R+ . There is also a
continuum of infinitely lived brokers of two types, denoted B and E. Each broker of type B,
or bond broker, is identified with a point in the set B = [0, NB ], with NB ∈ R+ . Each broker of
type E, or equity broker, is identified with a point in the set E = [0, NE ], with NE ∈ R+ . All
agents discount payoffs across periods with the same factor, β ∈ (0, 1).
    There is a continuum of production units with measure As ∈ R++ that are active every
period. Every active unit yields an exogenous dividend yt ∈ R+ of a perishable consumption
good at the end of the first subperiod of period t. (Each active unit yields the same dividend as
every other active unit, so yt As is the aggregate dividend.) At the beginning of every period,
every active unit is subject to an independent idiosyncratic shock that renders it permanently
unproductive with probability 1 − η ∈ [0, 1). If a production unit remains active, its dividend in
period t is yt = γ t yt−1 where γ t is a nonnegative random variable with cumulative distribution
function Γ, i.e., Pr (γ t ≤ γ) = Γ (γ), and mean γ̄ ∈ (0, (βη)−1 ). The time t dividend becomes
known to all agents at the beginning of period t, and at that time each failed production unit
is replaced by a new unit that yields dividend yt in the initial period and follows the same



                                                  5
stochastic process as other active units thereafter (the dividend of the initial set of production
units, y0 ∈ R++ , is given at t = 0). In the second subperiod of every period, every agent has
access to a linear production technology that transforms the agent’s effort into a perishable
homogeneous consumption good (the general good ).
      For each active production unit there is a durable and perfectly divisible equity share that
represents the bearer’s ownership of the production unit and confers the right to collect divi-
dends. At the beginning of every period t ≥ 1, each investor receives an endowment of (1 − η) As
equity shares corresponding to the new production units. (When a production unit fails, its
equity share disappears.) There is a second financial instrument, money, that is intrinsically
useless (it is not an argument of any utility or production function, and unlike equity, ownership
of money does not constitute a right to collect any resources). The quantity of money at time
t is denoted Am                                   m                       m       m
              t . The initial quantity of money, A0 ∈ R++ , is given and At+1 = µAt , with
µ ∈ R++ . A monetary authority injects or withdraws money via lump-sum transfers or taxes
to investors in the second subperiod of every period. At the beginning of period t = 0, each
investor is endowed with a portfolio of equity shares and money.
      As is standard in monetary theory, in order to preserve a meaningful role for money, we
assume investors are anonymous and unable to commit. If in addition there were also complete
lack of enforcement, investors would be unable to borrow, and would have no alternative but
to fund first-subperiod purchases with money. In order to allow for credit in purchases of
equity, we incorporate a limited form of enforcement by letting investors issue bonds that are
collateralized by the equity shares they own. Specifically, some investors can issue bonds in the
first subperiod of t, each representing a claim to one unit of the general good to be delivered in
the second subperiod of t. We assume the bond issued in the first subperiod of t is collateralized
in the sense that if the debtor defaults when the bond is due (at the beginning of the second
subperiod of t), then the creditor (i.e., the bond holder) appropriates a fraction λ ∈ [0, 1] of the
equity shares that the debtor owns at the time of default.2 All financial instruments (equity
shares, money, private bonds) are perfectly recognizable and cannot be forged.
      The market structure is as follows. In the second subperiod, all agents can trade the con-
sumption good produced in that subperiod, equity shares, and money in a spot Walrasian
market. In the first subperiod, brokers and investors trade equity shares, money, and collat-
eralized bonds. Trading in the first subperiod is organized as follows. Equity brokers have
  2
      This credit arrangement is similar to the one in Barro (1976) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997, 2005).



                                                       6
access to a Walrasian equity market where they can trade equity and money. Bond brokers
have access to a Walrasian bond market where they can trade collateralized bonds and money.
Investors access the bond and equity markets indirectly, by engaging in bilateral trades with
brokers whom they meet at random. Specifically, let χjk be an indicator function that equals 1 if
investor j ∈ I has a trading opportunity with a broker of type k ∈ {E, B} in the first subperiod.
Then αks ≡ Pr(χjE = k, χjB = s) for k, s ∈ {0, 1}, with k,s∈{0,1} αks = 1.3 Once a broker and
                                                        P

an investor have contacted each other, the pair negotiates the quantities of equity shares and
money (if the broker is an equity broker), or the quantities of bonds and money (if the broker
is a bond broker), that the broker will trade in the corresponding first-subperiod competitive
market on behalf of the investor, and an intermediation fee for the broker’s services. We assume
the terms of the trade between an investor and a broker are determined by Nash bargaining,
where an investor has bargaining power θ ∈ [0, 1] in negotiations with bond brokers, and all the
bargaining power in negotiations with equity brokers.4 The timing is that the round of trades
in the first-subperiod ends before production units yield dividends. Hence equity is traded cum
dividend in the first subperiod and ex dividend in the second subperiod.5
       An individual broker’s preferences are represented by
                                                   ∞

                                                   t=0

where j ∈ {E, B} denotes the broker’s type, ct is consumption of the homogeneous good that
is produced, traded, and consumed in the second subperiod of period t, and ht is the utility
cost from exerting ht units of effort to produce this good. The expectation operator Ej0 is with
respect to the probability measure induced by the dividend process and the random trading
process in the first subperiod. Brokers get no utility from the dividend good.6 An individual

     Below, we will refer to an investor j ∈ I with (χjE , χjB ) = (k, s) as an investor (of type) ks. Notice our
assumptions imply: (a) investors of type 10 and equity brokers can only trade equity and money, (b) investors of
type 01 and bond brokers can only trade bonds and money, and (c) investors of type 11 can trade bonds, equity,
and money.
   4
     The assumption that investors have all the bargaining power when negotiating with equity brokers is made
for analytical simplicity. It amounts to regarding the equity market as a conventional Walrasian market where
investors bear zero transaction costs, which is a good approximation to organized exchanges such as the New
York Stock Exchange. We have extensively studied the role of search and bargaining frictions in equity markets
in previous work (see, e.g., Lagos and Zhang 2015, 2019), so here we focus on the role that these frictions play
in the credit market.
   5
     As in conventional search models of financial over-the-counter markets, e.g., see Duffie et al. (2005) and
Lagos and Rocheteau (2009), an investor must own the equity share in order to consume the dividend.
   6
     This assumption implies that brokers have no direct consumption motive for holding the equity share. It

where yt is the quantity of the dividend good that an investor consumes at the end of the first
subperiod of period t, ct is consumption of the homogeneous good that is produced, traded, and
consumed in the second subperiod of period t, and ht is the utility cost from exerting ht units
of effort to produce this good. The variable εt denotes the realization of a valuation shock that
is distributed independently over time and across investors, with a differentiable cumulative
                                                                    R
distribution function G on the support [εL , εH ] ⊆ [0, ∞], and ε̄ = εdG (ε). Each investor
learns the realization εt at the beginning of period t. The expectation operator E0 is with
respect to the probability measure induced by the dividend process, the investor’s valuation
shock, and the random trading process in the first subperiod.

2.2    Discussion of institutional background and modeling assumptions

In modern financial markets, brokers and dealers allow certain investors to purchase eligible
securities on margin. “Margin” is an extension of credit from a broker-dealer to an investor
using the investor’s own securities as collateral. Funds borrowed on margin may be used for
any purpose, including the purchase of securities. In particular, funds borrowed on margin are
often used for the purchase of the same securities being pledged as collateral. Interest on the
borrowed funds accrues over the period of time that the loan is outstanding. The use of margin
is regulated by financial regulatory organizations, certain securities exchanges, and the broker-
dealer holding the margin account. Buying on margin is standard practice among sophisticated
investors. Hedge funds, for example, typically work with prime brokers that offer a package
of services, including securities lending, global custody, and financing in the form of margin
loans.7 Retail brokerage companies offer small or less sophisticated investors cash brokerage
accounts that require all securities purchases to be funded with cash. However, they often also
offer investors who meet certain additional requirements, margin accounts that allow to borrow
is easy to relax, but we adopt it because it is the standard benchmark in the search-based literature on over-
the-counter markets, see, e.g., Duffie et al. (2005), Lagos and Rocheteau (2009), Lagos, Rocheteau, and Weill
(2011), and Weill (2007).
    7
      Prime brokers are large investment banks or securities firms. The top list includes Bank of America Meryll
Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sacks, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS.

against eligible securities.8
    The typical margin loan works as follows. A broker extends an investor a loan of L dollars
in order to purchase A dollars worth of an asset, e.g., a stock. The investor’s own capital or
equity in this transaction is E = A − L. The stock is pledged as collateral to secure the loan,
and E is also known as the haircut (or downpayment). The investor’s equity, E, expressed as
a proportion of the value of the stock, A, is the margin on the loan, i.e., M = E/A. In other
words, the margin is the proportion of the value of the purchase of a security financed by the
investor’s own funds. The investor’s leverage is the reciprocal of the margin, i.e., L = A/E,
and the loan-to-value ratio is R = L/A.
    Margin accounts are subject to the rules of the Federal Reserve Board, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and securities exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange,
as well as the brokerage firm’s margin policies, which are sometimes more stringent than those
of the regulators. The Federal Reserve Board Regulation T that regulates the extension of
credit by securities brokers and dealers in the United States, specifies a minimum initial margin
requirement of 50% for new, or initial, stock purchases. (The Federal Reserve has the authority
to change this initial margin requirement, but it has been constant since 1974.) The rules of
FINRA and the exchanges supplement the requirements of Regulation T by placing additional
maintenance margin requirements on customer accounts. In particular, FINRA Rule 4210
requires that a customer maintains a minimum margin of 25% at all times. Under these rules,
if the customer’s margin falls below the minimum maintenance margin, which may be set by
some brokers to be higher than 25%, the customer may be required to deposit more funds in the
margin account to meet the minimum maintenance margin requirement. This is referred to as
a margin call. Failure to meet the margin call may cause the broker to liquidate the securities
in the customer’s account in order to bring the account back up to the required maintenance
margin level.
    The loans that investors receive (by issuing collateralized bonds) in the first subperiod, are
the theoretical counterparts of margin loans in actual financial markets. Suppose, as is the
case in the model, that the investor can borrow up to a fraction λ of the value of the stock,
and chooses to borrow that amount, i.e., L = λA. In this case, the margin is M = 1 − λ,
leverage is L = (1 − λ)−1 , and the loan-to-value ratio is R = λ. In the model, the investor has
   8
     Examples of retail brokers that offer margin accounts to small investors include Charles Schwab Corporation,
E-Trade, Fidelity Investments, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, TradeStation, and USAA Brokerage.



                                                       9
no need to roll over the margin loan, so M = 1 − λ can be interpreted as the initial margin
requirement, which is constant and typically similar across brokerage firms and eligible stocks.9
In the model, as in actual markets, investors who want to buy stocks and are able to obtain
margin loans from brokers can take on leverage, while those who cannot get margin loans must
rely on their own funds.
    We model margin loans as bilateral agreements with terms that are negotiated between the
parties, as is the case for large investors in real-world markets. In the model, an investor may
trade equity with no access to a margin loan (with probability α10 ), may lend funds and not
trade equity (with probability α01 ), or may trade equity with access to margin loans (with
probability α11 ). This is a flexible and simple way to capture the multitude of circumstances
investors may face in actual financial markets. For example, α10 > 0 captures the fact that on
a given day some investors may be unable to secure (mutually acceptable terms for) margin
loans from brokers. The market structure in the first subperiod represents a prototypical over-
the-counter (OTC) trading arrangement that involves finding a suitable counterparty and then
negotiating the terms of the trade. Notice this general stylized OTC structure nests several
perfectly competitive benchmarks as special cases. For example, α10 = 1 corresponds to an
equity market that is competitive and frictionless (i.e., with no search or bargaining frictions),
where all trades must be paid for with money. Alternatively, α11 = θ = 1 corresponds to
competitive, frictionless, and fully integrated equity and loan markets.

2.3    Bargaining and portfolio problems

Three bargaining situations may arise in the OTC round of trade. With probability α10 , an
investor only contacts an equity broker, and they bargain over the quantities of equity and
money the investor buys or sells, and the broker’s intermediation fee. In this case the bargain-
ing protocol is that the investor makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the equity broker. With
probability α01 , an investor only contacts a bond broker, and they bargain over the quantities
of bonds and money the investor buys or sells, and the broker’s intermediation fee (the outcome
is determined by Nash bargaining with investor bargaining power θ). With probability α11 , an
investor contacts both an equity broker and a bond broker, and simultaneously bargains with
both over the quantities of equity, bonds, and money, as well as the respective intermediation

     Since in the theory the investor repays the loan at the end of the period when it was issued, there is no role
for maintenance margin requirements or margin calls.

fees. In this case the bargaining protocol is that the investor makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer
to the equity broker, and the outcome of the negotiation with the bond broker is determined
by Nash bargaining with investor bargaining power θ. Throughout we assume a broker’s fee
is expressed in terms of the general good and paid by the investor in the second subperiod.10
Next, we formulate the portfolio problems faced by each type of broker at the end of the first
subperiod (after the round of OTC trades), and then turn to the three bargaining situations
an investor may face in the OTC round of trade.
    An individual agent’s portfolio at the beginning of period t is represented by a vector
at = (am    s      2                         m                          s
       t , at ) ∈ R+ , i.e., it consists of at ∈ R+ units of money and at ∈ R+ equity shares.
                                                                                             11

Let ŴtE (at , kt ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff of an equity broker with
portfolio at = (am    s
                 t , at ) and earned fee kt , as he reallocates his portfolio in the equity market
at the end of the first subperiod of period t (i.e., after the OTC round of transactions). Let
WtE (at , kt ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff, at the beginning of the second
subperiod of period t, of an equity broker who has earned fee kt in the OTC round of period t,
and is holding portfolio at = (am    s 12 Then
                                t , at ).


                                ŴtE (at , kt ) =      max         WtE (am    s
                                                                         t , at , kt )                       (1)

                                              t + pt at ≤ at + pt at ,

where at = (am    s
             t , at ) and pt denotes the nominal price of an equity share in the first-subperiod
equity market. We use āEt = (am          s
                               Et (at ), aEt (at )) to denote the solution to (1), and refer to it as
the equity broker’s post-trade portfolio.
    Let ŴtB (at , kt ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff of a bond broker with
portfolio at = (am    s
                 t , at ) and earned fee kt , as he reallocates his portfolio in the bond market
at the end of the first subperiod of period t (i.e., after the OTC round of transactions).13 Let
  10
     In related work (Lagos and Zhang, 2015), we instead assume that the investor must pay the intermediation
fee on the spot, i.e., with money or equity. The alternative formulation we use here makes the analysis and the
exposition much simpler while the main economic mechanisms are essentially unchanged.
  11
     Since bonds issued in the OTC round of period t − 1 are settled in the second subperiod of t − 1, there are
no bonds outstanding at the beginning of period t.
  12
     Equity brokers’ bond position is always zero since they have no access to the bond market in the OTC round
(and therefore cannot trade bonds in the current period), and there are no bonds outstanding at the beginning
of the period.
  13
     In principle, the bond broker may be holding a nonzero bond position when reallocating his portfolio at the
end of the OTC round. However, as will become clear when we formulate the relevant bargaining problem, it is
without loss of generality to assume that the broker’s portfolio after having provided intermediation services to
an investor is the same as the broker’s beginning-of-period portfolio, which has zero bonds.


                                                         11
WtB (at , abt , kt ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff, at the beginning of the second
subperiod of period t, of a bond broker who has earned fee kt in the OTC round of period t,
and is holding portfolio (at , abt ) = (am    s b         2

where at = (am    s
             t , at ) and qt is the nominal price of a bond. The first constraint is the budget
constraint the bond broker faces in the bond market of the OTC round. The second constraint
is the collateral constraint that ensures the bond broker will prefer to repay in the following
subperiod any debt he may have issued in the previous OTC round, rather than default and
forfeit a fraction λ of his equity holding. Notice that the bond broker’s equity holding, ast , is fixed
in the portfolio problem (2), since he has no access to the equity market and is therefore unable
to change his equity holding in the OTC round. We use aBt (at ) = (am          s          b

and valuation ε. This investor may find himself in three bargaining situations. With probabil-
ity α10 the investor only contacts an equity broker, and the investor’s post-trade portfolio is
a10t (at , ε) = (am              s              b                    b

where 0 is used to represent (0, 0). In this case the investor is making a take-it-or-leave-it offer
to the equity broker, so the bargaining outcome consists of an intermediation fee equal to zero
(that leaves the broker indifferent between trading or not), and an investor post-trade portfolio
given by (3) that maximizes the investor’s continuation payoff. Notice that in this case the
investor’s bond holding is fixed at its beginning-of-period value of 0 since he has no access to
the bond market and therefore cannot change his bond holding in the OTC round.

The objective function in (4) is the standard geometric average of the investor’s and the broker’s
gains from trade. The first constraint is the budget constraint the investor faces in the bond
market of the OTC round. The second constraint ensures the trade is incentive compatible for
the investor and the restriction kt ∈ R+ ensures the trade is incentive compatible for the bond
broker. The third constraint is the collateral constraint that ensures the investor will prefer
to repay in the following subperiod any debt he may have issued in the previous OTC round,
rather than default and forfeit a fraction λ of his equity holding. Notice that the investor’s
equity holding, ast , is fixed in the bargaining/portfolio problem (4), since the investor has no
access to the equity market and therefore cannot change his equity holding in the OTC round.
    With probability α11 the investor can simultaneously trade with an equity broker and a

where at =         t , at , at . Recall that in this situation the bargaining protocol is that the
investor makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the equity broker. This has two implications. First,
the equity broker’s gain from trade, i.e., her intermediation fee, equals zero (just as in the
bargaining solution (3)). Second, if the investor and the bond broker where unable to reach


                                                                 13
an agreement, the investor can still trade with the equity broker at the terms specified by (3).
Hence the outcome (3) is the investor’s outside option in his bargaining problem with the bond
broker. Therefore the investor’s gain from trade corresponding to an outcome (at , kt ) from
the joint negotiation with both brokers, consists of the continuation payoff εyt ast + WtI (at , kt ),
minus the investor’s outside option, εyt as10t (at , ε) + WtI (am              s

payoff the investor achieves in (3). The first constraint is the budget constraint the investor
faces in the OTC round when he is able to trade simultaneously in the equity and the bond
market. The second constraint ensures the trade is incentive compatible for the investor (the
restriction kt ∈ R+ ensures the trade is also incentive compatible for the bond broker, and the
equity broker is willing to participate since her fee is equal to 0). The third constraint is the
collateral constraint that ensures the investor will prefer to repay in the following subperiod any
debt he may have issued in the previous OTC round, rather than default and forfeit a fraction
λ of his equity holding.

     (i) Consider an investor who enters the OTC round of period t with equity holding ast and

fee, and the post-trade portfolio is (as01t (ast ) , ab01t (ast )) = (ast , 0).

     (iii) The post-trade portfolio of an equity broker who enters the OTC round of period t with
equity holding ast is asEt (ast ) = ast .

     Parts (i )(a) and (i )(b) of Lemma 1 state that investors who do not simultaneously contact




                                                                17
an equity and a bond broker, are unable to trade in the OTC round.14 Part (i )(c) states that
an investor who is simultaneously in contact with an equity and a bond broker can buy or sell
equity and take a long or short position in bonds. Specifically, from (15) and (16), if ε < εnt ,
then the investor sells all his equity for bonds. Conversely, if εnt < ε, the investor shorts the
bond in order to take a long position in equity. Condition (17) indicates the bond broker earns
a fee on these transactions as long as ε 6= εnt (the equity broker never earns a fee according to
our bargaining protocol). Parts (ii ) and (iii ) state that brokers only intermediate trades and
do not trade on their own account in the OTC round.
       Notice the nonmonetary benchmark is capable of supporting trade in the OTC round, but
only among investors who contact both an equity and a bond broker. The reason is that even
though only equity can be traded in the equity market, and only bonds can be traded in the
bond market, investors with access to both markets can trade in those markets simultaneously,
                                                                                                        s
which implies these investors are actually able to exchange these securities at a price of φ̄t bonds
per equity share.15 Since each bond is a claim to 1 unit of the second-supberiod consumption
                            s
good, we can think of φ̄t as the real cum dividend price in the OTC round of an equity share,
expressed in terms of the second-subperiod consumption good. Conversely, in the nonmonetary
economy there is an implied real interest rate on bonds (expressed in terms of equity shares),
denoted int . In the OTC round, an investor of type 11 can use 1 unit of equity to purchase
  14
      In a nonmonetary economy, investors who only contact an equity broker can only trade equity and therefore
cannot buy equity because they have no way to pay, and cannot sell equity because they have no way to get paid
(also, these investors cannot sell or buy bonds because they are not in contact with the bond market). Investors
who only contact a bond broker have no benefit from selling bonds and no way to buy bonds in a nonmonetary
economy (since they cannot trade equity because they are not in contact with the equity market).
   15
      Our market structure implies agents with access to the equity market (i.e., investors of type 10, investors
of type 11, and equity brokers) can trade equity and money, while agents with access to the bond market (i.e.,
investors of type 01, investors of type 11, and bond brokers) can trade bonds and money. This market structure
is different from a conventional cash-in-advance formulation, e.g., in the spirit of Lucas (1980), where agents
with access to the equity market would be restricted to trading equity for money, and agents with access to
the bond market would be restricted to trading bonds for money. The fact that the nonmonetary equilibrium
supports some trade in equity and bonds makes it clear that our formulation does not require agents to hold
cash (in advance or otherwise) to be able to trade equity or bonds. In contrast, absent money, trade in equity or
bonds would be impossible in a conventional cash-in-advance formulation, which by assumption would require
every equity and bond purchase to be paid in cash. Neither does the payment structure in our model fit the
predetermined cash-good/credit-good taxonomy assumed in Lucas and Stokey’s (1983) extension of the pure
cash-in-advance model. In our model, at a given point in time, equity may resemble a “cash good” to investors
who only contact an equity broker, but a “credit good” to investors who contact an equity and a bond broker
simultaneously. Similarly, over time, for a given investor, equity may resemble a “cash good” at times when the
investor only contacts an equity broker, or a “credit good” at times when the investor contacts an equity and a
bond broker simultaneously. Another way in which our model is different from a cash-in-advance formulation is
that, as shown below, transaction velocity is endogenous (it changes with the monetary policy stance), and can
exceed 1 in a model period.

φ̄t bonds. These bonds deliver φ̄t general goods in the following subperiod, when the relative
                                                                              s
price of general goods in terms of equity shares is 1/φst . Thus int ≡ φ̄t /φst − 1, or equivalently,
                                                εn y t
                                           int = t s .                                           (18)

Finally, to see why (14) is necessary for the bargaining outcome to be well defined, consider
the budget constraint and the collateral constraint of an investor who contacts an equity and
                            s              s
a bond broker, namely φ̄t ast + abt = φ̄t ast , and −λφst ast ≤ abt . These two conditions imply the
                                                 s
borrowing constraint −λφst ast ≤ 1 − λφst /φ̄t abt . This constraint would be slack for all abt < 0
if (14) were violated, meaning that an investor with ε > εnt would be able (and willing) to
take an infinitely long position in the stock. Intuitively, notice that if (14) is violated, then
                                                                                              s
an investor who starts with no wealth can sell b collateralized bonds to purchase b/φ̄t equity
shares and this leveraged purchase would leave the investor’s borrowing constraint slack, since
             s
b < λφst b/φ̄t . Notice that with (18), (14) can be written as λ < 1 + int , so (14) could only be
violated if the net real interest were negative, which as we show below, will not be the case in
equilibrium.

    (ii) The post-trade portfolio of a bond broker who enters the OTC round of period t with
portfolio at is aBt (at ) = a01t (at ).
    (iii) The post-trade portfolio of an equity broker who enters the OTC round of period t with
portfolio at is aEt (at ) = a10t (at , 0).

    Part (i )(a) of Lemma 2 states that the individual investor with valuation ε who is only able
to contact an equity broker in the OTC, uses all his money balances to buy equity if ε∗10t < ε,
and sells all his equity for money if ε < ε∗10t . The intermediation fee is zero in this case given
our assumption that the investor has all the bargaining power in negotiations with an equity
broker. Part (i )(b) considers the case of an investor with beginning-of-period asset holding
at and valuation ε who only contacts a bond broker. Since this investor cannot trade equity,

                                                             20
his post-trade equity holding is the same as the pre-trade equity holding. This investor may,
however, buy or sell bonds for money. if qt φm
                                             t < 1, then the investor uses all his money to
buy bonds. Conversely, if 1 < qt φm
                                  t , the investor short sells as much of the bond as allowed
by the collateral constraint, and holds the proceeds in the form of money. The bond broker is
able to extract a fee whenever the investor’s gain from trading bonds is positive. Part (i )(c)
describes the bargaining outcome of an investor who simultaneously contacts an equity and a
bond broker. To offer a simple interpretation of the post-trade allocation in this case, suppose
qt φ m
     t < 1 (which will in fact be the case in an equilibrium where the nominal interest rate on
the bond is positive). Then if ε∗11t < ε, the investor short sells as much of the bond as allowed
by the collateral constraint, and uses the proceeds from the short sale along with all his pre-
trade money balances to buy equity. Conversely, if ε < ε∗11t , the investor sells all his pre-trade
equity holding and uses the proceeds from the sale, and all his pre-trade money balances to
buy bonds. The bond broker extracts a fee whenever the investor has positive gain from trade.
Part (ii ) states that the post-trade portfolio of a bond broker with some pre-trade portfolio is
the same as the post-trade portfolio of an investor with the same pre-trade portfolio who only
contacts a bond broker. Part (iii ) states that the post-trade portfolio of an equity broker with
some pre-trade portfolio is the same as the post-trade portfolio of an investor with the same
pre-trade portfolio and valuation ε = 0 who only contacts an equity broker.
       To see why condition (27) is necessary for the bargaining outcome of an investor of type 11
to be well defined, it is useful to think of the interest rate implied by the inside bond. First,
                                                                           1                                       1
notice that with 1 unit of money an investor can buy                       qt   bonds, which in total yield        qt   general
                                                                                     1

Since the loan is repaid within the period, this is also a notion of real rate on these loans, with
loan and repayment measured in terms of the general good.16 Another notion of interest rate
that corresponds to the one we defined for the economy with no money, is the real interest rate
on bonds expressed in terms of equity shares. If an investor uses 1 unit of money to purchase
                                                        1                                       1                                1

real rate on a bond (in terms of equity shares) is

Consider the budget constraint and the collateral constraint of an investor who contacts an
                                                                        s s
equity and a bond broker, namely am       s       b    m       s                b
                                  t + pt at + qt at = at + pt at and −λφt at ≤ at . These
two conditions imply the borrowing constraint −λφst [ast + (am    m                     s        b
                                                             t − at ) /pt ] ≤ (1 − λqt φt /pt ) at .
This constraint would be slack for all abt < 0 if (27) were violated, meaning that an investor
with ε > ε∗11t would be able (and willing) to take an infinitely long position in the stock.
Intuitively, notice that if (27) is violated, then an investor of type 11 who starts with no wealth
can sell b collateralized bonds for money and use the monetary proceeds to purchase bqt /pt
equity shares; this leveraged purchase would leave the investor’s borrowing constraint slack,
since b < λφst bqt /pt . Notice that with (33), (27) can be written as λ < 1 + ist , so (27) could only
be violated if the net real interest were negative, which as we show below, will not be the case
in equilibrium.
        Notice im
                t is the interest rate a type 11 investor would face if he had direct access to
the competitive bond market. However, access to the bond market is intermediated by a
bond broker who charges a fee k11t (at , ε) to a type 11 investor with pre-trade portfolio at and
valuation ε who wishes to trade ab11t (at , ε) bonds. Thus, the fee the investor pays per unit of
                     k11t (at ,ε)
bond traded is                      and the effective interest rate at which the investor can borrow (if
                    |ab11t (at ,ε)|

        Hereafter, to simplify the exposition, unless otherwise specified, we assume that α01 = 0
and α10 , α11 ∈ (0, 1), that brokers cannot hold equity or money overnight.17 We focus the
analysis on equilibria with an active bond market, which implies qt φm
                                                                     t ≤ 1 or equivalently,
  17
     We assume α01 = 0 for two reasons. First, the analysis is cleanest in this case. Second, for the purposes of
studying margin loans, it is sufficient and it is natural to assume that only investors who participate in equity
trades get in contact with the brokers who offer margin loans. The assumption that brokers do not hold money
overnight is immaterial (they would not want to hold it even if they were allowed), as is the assumption that bond
brokers do not carry equity. Whether the assumption that equity brokers do not hold equity overnight represents
a restriction on behavior will depend on the inflation rate; for inflation rates higher than a certain threshold,
they would be disinclined to do so. See Lagos and Zhang (2015, 2019) for more details on these considerations
in related trading environments.

(stationary) equilibria, i.e., equilibria in which: (a) real equity prices (and real money balances,
if the equilibrium is monetary) are time-invariant linear functions of the aggregate dividend,
and (b) aggregate equity holdings of each agent type are constant over time. Next, we define
nonmonetary, and monetary recursive equilibria in turn.

    Lemma 10 in the appendix establishes that qt φm t ≤ 1 is necessary for bonds to trade in equilibrium. We
focus on equilibria with an active bond market because if the bond is not traded, money is the only means of
payment and the equilibrium conditions specialize to those in Lagos and Zhang (2019).

is the time t nominal yield to maturity of the bond with k periods until maturity. Throughout
the analysis we let β̄ ≡ βγ̄ and maintain the assumption µ > β̄ (but we consider the limiting
case µ → β̄). Since there is a one-to-one mapping between the policy variable µ and the interest
rate ip , we can regard ip as the nominal policy rate chosen by the monetary authority.
   Hereafter, we focus on a formulation of the model where the length of the time period
becomes arbitrarily short, which allows us to deliver sharp theoretical results. This limiting
economy can be interpreted as an approximation to a continuous-time version of our discrete-
time economy. To this end, we first generalize the discrete-time model by allowing the period
length to be an arbitrary constant, and then take the limit as this constant becomes arbitrarily
small. Let ∆ denote the length of the model period, and define the discount rate, r, the
expected dividend growth rate, g, the depreciation rate, δ, and the money growth rate, π, as
β ≡ (1 + r∆)−1 , γ̄ ≡ 1 + g∆, η ≡ 1 − δ∆, µ ≡ 1 + π∆. Over a time period of length ∆, the
dividend is yt ∆, and utility from consumption of the dividend good is εyt ∆. In this context
we focus on recursive equilibria where, as ∆ → 0, real asset prices are time-invariant linear
functions of the dividend rate, yt . Specifically, let Φst (∆) and Φm      m
                                                                    t (∆) At denote the real equity
price and the real aggregate money balance, respectively, in the discrete-time economy with
time periods of length ∆. We look for recursive equilibria of this discrete-time economy such
that Φst (∆) = Φs (∆) yt ∆ and Φm      m          s             s

Intuitively, ρn is the competitive real interest rate on inside bonds in a nonmonetary economy,
ρm and ρs are the competitive nominal and real interest rates on inside bonds in a monetary
economy, ρl (ε) is the intermediated nominal interest rate available to a type 11 investor with
valuation ε in a monetary economy, and ρp is the policy nominal interest rate that can be
controlled by the monetary authority (e.g., by changing π). Notice that ρp = r + π̄ is a Fisher
equation that equates the nominal rate interest rate (on an illiquid outside bond) to the real
risk-free interest rate, r, plus an expected inflation rate, π̄ ≡ π − g (measured with the price of
the general consumption good).20 For what follows, it is useful to let ϕ ≡ ρφs , Z ≡ ρZ, and
ι ≡ ρp /ρ, where
                                                            1 1 − β̄η

The factor ρ can be interpreted as a capitalization rate for equity holdings, so ϕ and Z are the
“flow values” of an equity share and a unit of real balances, respectively, and ι is the policy
rate up to a convenient normalization. In the remainder, we focus on the limiting economy that
obtains as ∆ → 0.

    The discrete-time formulation we laid out previously, corresponds to a special case of this formulation with
∆ = 1, Φst (1) ≡ φst , Φm        m     s         s
                        t (1) ≡ φt , Φ (1) ≡ φ , and Z(1) ≡ Z.
 20                                                                       yt
    The (gross) inflation rate in terms of general goods is φm   m
                                                             t /φt+1 = µ yt+1 ≡ 1 + π̃ t+1 , which is stochastic. A
measure of this average (expected) inflation is
                                                   −1

                                         1 + π̃ t+1      γ̄ 1 + g∆
so as ∆ → 0, we get π̄ = π − g as a measure of the expected inflation in the nominal price of general goods.
Since pt+1 /pt − 1 = µ − 1 = π∆, the inflation rate in the nominal price of equity shares is π.

Proposition 1 Consider the limiting economy (as ∆ → 0). There exists a unique recursive
nonmonetary equilibrium, (εn , ϕn ). Moreover,

and εn ∈ [εL , εH ] is the unique solution to

                                                 G (εn ) = λ.                                      (42)

   The asset price in the nonmonetary equilibrium can be decomposed into three components.
The first term in (41) is the expected value of the dividend flow. The second term in (41) is the
expected gain from exercising the option of reselling the asset in the OTC market. The third
term in (41) reflects the expected marginal value of the asset when it is pledged as collateral
for shorting the bond. We will label these components the (value of the) resale option, and the
(value of the) pledge option, respectively. From (42), it is clear the marginal investor valuation
that clears the OTC market, εn , is increasing in λ, reflecting the fact that as λ increases,
the collateral constraint is relaxed, and higher valuation investors are able to absorb a higher
proportion of the asset holdings. In particular, εn → εH as λ → 1. For a given εn , the asset
price is increasing in λ, but in the general equilibrium, a larger λ implies a larger εn , which in
turn implies an investor is less likely to receive a valuation shock large enough to want to use
the asset as collateral, and this force tends to make the price decreasing in λ. It is possible to
show, however, that the former effect always dominates, and ϕn is increasing in λ even after
taking into account the general equilibrium effect (see Lemma 14 in the appendix).
   The model is quite general in terms of the trading situations investors may face in the OTC
round: A fraction α10 of investors trade equity with no access to a margin loan, a fraction α11
trade equity with access to margin loans, and a fraction α01 do not participate of the equity
market but are able to lend money through bond brokers. The following proposition offers a
complete characterization of the set of RME for an economy with α01 = 0. Let

                                                                                                                  , so 0 ≤ ῑ (1) −ῑ (0)
holds with “=” only if α11 θ = 0. In particular, notice θ = 0 (or α11 = 0) implies ῑ (λ) = ῑ (0) for all λ.


                                                                  27
in Proposition 1, a nonmonetary equilibrium exists for any parametrization, and therefore for
every configuration of parameters shown in Figure 1. For each λ ∈ [0, 1], ῑ (λ) is the largest
nominal policy rate consistent with existence of monetary equilibrium. No monetary equilibrium
exists for ι ≥ ῑ (λ), so in that case the nonmonetary equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. For
every ι < ῑ (λ), the nonmonetary equilibrium coexists with a monetary equilibrium. For each
λ ∈ (0, 1], the monetary equilibrium is qualitatively different depending on whether the policy
rate is higher or lower than ι̂ (λ).
   If ι̂ (λ) < ι < ῑ (λ), then credit is scarce in the sense that the nominal interest rate on margin
loans, ρm , is positive. In this case, type 10 investors with valuations larger than ε∗10 use all their
money to take a long position in equity, and investors of type 11 with valuations larger than
ε∗11 short the bond up to the collateral constraint, and use all their money in order to purchase
equity. Investors of type 10 with valuations smaller than ε∗10 sell all their equity holdings for
money, and investors of type 11 with valuations smaller than ε∗11 sell all their equity holdings and
use all the proceeds along with their pre-trade money holdings to take a long position in bonds.
Notice that in this parameter range, εL < ε∗10 < ε∗11 = εn , so the marginal equity buyer of type
10 has a lower valuation than the marginal equity buyer of type 11, and the latter has the same
valuation he would have in the nonmonetary equilibrium. The fact that ε∗10 < ε∗11 reflects that
type 11 investors have the option of investing money in the interest-yielding inside bond, while
this option is not available to investors of type 10. Notice that the equity price in this region of
the parameter space is larger than the equity price in the nonmonetary equilibrium. The first
reason (captured by the term multiplied by α10 in (45)) is that in a monetary equilibrium there
are equity-for-money trades in the equity market so the investor of type 10 can resell equity if
her valuation is relatively low, while this is not possible in the nonmonetary equilibrium. The
second reason (captured by the term multiplied by α11 (1 − θ) in (45)) is that the option of
being able to sell equity for money in the equity market improves the outside option of a type
11 investor when he bargains for the terms of the trade with the bond broker who helps the
investor take a long position in the bond.
   Conversely, if 0 < ι ≤ ι̂ (λ), then real balances are abundant and credit demand is relatively
weak, so ρm = 0 and money is not dominated by inside bonds in terms of rate of return. In
this case, investors of type 10 with valuations larger than ε∗ use all their money to buy equity
while investors of type 10 with valuations lower than ε∗ sell all their equity for money. Investors
of type 11 with valuations larger than ε∗ short the bond up to the collateral constraint, and


                                                  28
use all their money in order to purchase equity. Investors of type 11 with valuations smaller
than ε∗11 sell all their equity holdings, and are indifferent between holding the proceeds (and
any pre-trade money holdings) in the form of money or bonds. Notice that in this parameter
range, εL < εn ≤ ε∗10 = ε∗11 = ε∗ < εH , so the marginal equity buyer of type 10 has the same
valuation as the marginal equity buyer of type 11, and this valuation is larger than the valuation
an investor of type 11 would have in the nonmonetary equilibrium. The fact that ε∗10 = ε∗11
reflects that the nominal rate on inside bonds is equal to zero, so type 11 investors and type 10
investors have the same valuation for money in the OTC round, even though only the former
can lend it in the bond market.
   Interestingly, the monetary equilibrium becomes a more robust trading arrangement when
the loan-to-value ratio λ increases. To see this, notice that
                                                               Rε

with “=” only if α11 θ = 0. In other words, the maximum rate of inflation consistent with
monetary equilibrium is increasing with λ. So as long as 0 < α11 θ, money and credit (in the
form of leveraged purchases of equity) behave as complements, rather than substitutes, in the
general equilibrium. The reason money has value in the monetary equilibrium is that high-
valuation investors use it to finance a long position in the equity. So for larger λ, this value
of money in exchange is enhanced because the equity shares an investor of type 11 buys with
money can themselves be used as collateral to short the bond and take an even larger long
position in the equity.
   The following result summarizes the implications of monetary exchange and monetary policy
for asset prices.

Proposition 3 (i) The real asset price in the monetary equilibrium is higher than in the non-
monetary equilibrium, i.e., ϕn ≤ ϕ for all ι ∈ [0,ῑ (λ)], with “=” only if ι = ῑ (λ). Moreover,
ϕ ≤ ψ ≡ ε̄ + (α10 + α11 ) (εH − ε̄), with “=” only if ι = 0.
   (ii) In a monetary equilibrium, ϕ is decreasing in ι. If ι̂ (λ) < ι < ῑ (λ), then ε∗10 (the
valuation of the marginal investor with no access to credit) is decreasing in ι. If 0 < ι ≤ ι̂ (λ),
then ε∗ (the valuation of the marginal investor) is decreasing in ι.

3.1    Example

In this section we consider the special case G (ε) = GL I{εL ≤ε<εH } + I{εH ≤ε} with GL = 1 −
GH ∈ [0, 1], for which equilibrium can be solved for in closed form. The explicit formulas for
equilibrium allocations and prices allow us to clearly explain the key mechanisms. The following
proposition summarizes the characterization for the RNE.

Proposition 4 Assume G (ε) = GL I{εL ≤ε<εH } +I{εH ≤ε} , and consider the limiting economy (as
∆ → 0) with α10 , α11 , α01 ∈ (0, 1). There exists a unique stationary nonmonetary equilibrium
(generically, for any combination of parameters with nonzero measure). The equity price is
                                                           λ

                         ϕ =
                                 ε̄ + α11 θπ L (εH − εL )     GL ≤ λ

and the valuation of the investor who is indifferent between purchasing equity or lending is
                                    
                                     = εL         if λ < GL
                                 εn   ∈ [εL , εH ] if λ = GL
                                      = εH         if GL < λ.
                                    

    The equilibrium in Proposition 4 depends qualitatively on the degree to which investors can
buy on margin. If λ < GL (margins are high) then the equity price consists of the dividend flow
plus the value of the pledge option (the value of the resale option is nil because the marginal
investor of type 11 who is pricing the asset has valuation εL ). In this case the asset price is
increasing in λ. If GL ≤ λ then the equity price consists of the dividend flow plus the value
of the resale option (the value of the pledge option is nil because the marginal investor of type
11 who is pricing the asset has valuation εH ). In this case the asset price is independent of λ.
The (net) real interest rate in the nonmonetary equilibrium is

   According to Proposition 5, monetary equilibrium exists if and only if (ι, λ) ∈ E1m ∪E2m ∪E3m .
Economies with (ι, λ) ∈ E1m can be thought of as high-leverage economies. Economies with
(ι, λ) ∈ E2m have relatively low leverage and relatively low nominal policy rate. Economies
with (ι, λ) ∈ E3m have relatively low leverage and relatively high nominal policy rate (the set
E3m collapses to a point if α01 = 0). We describe the monetary equilibrium of each of these
economies in turn.
   In an economy E1m , investor’s post trade portfolios in the OTC market are as follows: (a)
since ε∗10 < εH , high-valuation investors of type 10 hold equity and no money (and no bonds,
since they cannot access the bond market); (b) since εL < ε∗10 , low-valuation investors of type 10
                                                                       (1−λ)[α11 (α01 +α10 +α11 )+α10 α01 GL ]
hold money and no equity (and no bonds); (c) a fraction χsH
                                                         11 =                 α11 (α01 +α10 +α11 )GH
of the high-valuation investors of type 11 carry equity, a negative bond position, and no money;
(d ) the remaining 1 − χsH
                        11 fraction of high-valuation investors of type 11, and low-valuation
investors of type 11, carry a positive bond position, no money, and no equity; (e) investors of
type 01 hold a positive bond position, no money, and the equity they had at the beginning
of the period. Notice that all high-valuation investors of type 10 hold equity, while not all

                                                    32
high-valuation investors of type 11 hold equity. The reason is that the equilibrium nominal
                                                 εH −ε∗10
interest rate on inside bonds, ρm =                 ϕ     ρ   is positive and high enough to induce some type
11 high-valuation investors to buy bonds rather than equity (both yield the same return in
equilibrium). In contrast, type 10 investors have no other use for their money than investing
in equity.
       In economy E2m , investor’s post trade portfolios in the OTC market are as follows: (a)
high-valuation investors of type 10 carry equity, no money, and no bonds; (b) low-valuation
investors of type 10 carry money, no equity, and no bonds; (c) high-valuation investors of type
11 carry equity, a negative bond position, and no money; (d ) low-valuation investors of type 11,
carry no equity, and are indifferent between carrying money or nonnegative bond holdings; (e)
investors of type 01 carry the equity they had at the beginning of the period and are indifferent
between borrowing, lending, or holding money, since the nominal interest rate on inside bonds
in this case is ρm = 0.

bond position, no money, and the equity they had at the beginning of the period. The nominal

interest rate on inside bonds in this case, ρm =                       ϕ    ρ,   is positive, but low enough such that
all high-valuation investors of type 11 prefer shorting the bond rather than lending. Figure 2

4         Cashless limits

In this section we study the properties of the monetary equilibrium in situations where agents
can economize in the use of cash, and in settings where aggregate real cash balances are small
relative to the aggregate real value of the stock of financial assets being traded. In other
words, we study economies that can be construed as approximations to pure-credit or cashless
economies.23 To this end, we focus on the baseline economy with general G and α01 = 0
and study the limiting equilibrium as either: (i ) λ → 1, (ii ) ι → ῑ (λ), or (iii ) α10 → 0.
The first limit approximates an economy where investors of type 11 can buy assets with zero
margin (infinite leverage). Thus in this case a measure α11 of investors can greatly economize
on cash use along the intensive margin of trade. The second limit operates directly on the
opportunity cost of holding of money and approximates an economy where this cost is so high
that aggregate real balances become negligible. The third limit approximates an economy
where—regardless of the equilibrium value of money—nobody needs money to trade, in the
sense that it is budget feasible for every individual investor to long equity by shorting the bond,
without ever using money as means of payment. In each of these limits we study aggregate real
balances, transaction velocity, and the role of monetary policy on trading activity and asset
prices.
         In a stationary equilibrium, we can define transaction velocity of money, V, as the ratio of
the nominal value of all transactions to the money supply, i.e.,
                     [α10 G(ε∗10 ) + α11 G(ε∗11 )] pt As   [α10 G(ε∗10 ) + α11 G(ε∗11 )] (ε∗10 + φs )
                V≡                                       =                                            .
                                    Amt                                       Z

Transaction velocity is useful in this context as a measure of the “efficiency of cash use”, i.e., as a
measure of the average number of transactions that can be supported per dollar in circulation.24
    23
      In this paper we follow the tradition in monetay theory to use “cash” as a synonym of unbacked “money.”
Hence by “cashless economy” we mean a “moneyless economy” akin to the “pure credit system” envisioned by
Wicksell (1898, p. 62-70) that Woodford (2003) uses to motivate his moneyless approach to monetary economics.
In lay terms, in contrast, “cash” often refers to currency, so with this alternative terminology, it would be possible
for a payment system to be cashless but not moneyless.
   24
      Money in our model may be traded many times in an OTC round. Consider a dollar initially spent by an
equity buyer. If the dollar ends up in the hands of an equity seller of type 10, the dollar is not further circulated.
But if the dollar ends up in the hands of an equity seller of type 11, it flows from the seller through the margin
loans market to an equity buyer of type 11 who borrows. The dollar, now in the hands of the type 11 borrower,
will travel further, to a seller and possibly further to another margin loan borrower, until it eventually ends up,
unspent, in the post-OTC portfolio of a seller who carries it into the following subperiod (this seller is necessarily
of type 10, if qt φm                                     m
                   t < 1 or possibly of type 11 if qt φt = 1). In this sense, we can think of margin loans as a
liquidity saving mechanism, which helps sustain monetary equilibrium.

    Proposition 6 shows that, as λ → 1, real balances remain positive and velocity remains
bounded as long as α10 ∈ R++ and ι < ῑ (1). This is not surprising given money demand in
the OTC round is supported by low-valuation investors of type 10, and money demand in the
second subperiod is supported by the probability of being a high-valuation investor of type 10
in the following period. The portfolio problem of the investor of type 11 remains well defined
even as λ approaches 1 because the equilibrium real interest rate in that limit becomes very
             εH
high, ρs →    ϕ ρ,      which in equilibrium limits their desire to short the bond.

    Proposition 7 is a familiar “cashless limit” in micro-founded monetary models: as the op-
portunity cost of holding money becomes very large, real balances approach zero. In this case,
since the real value of the equity purchases of the α11 type 11 investors remains positive in
the limit, the transaction velocity of money diverges to infinity. The transaction velocity cor-
responding only to type 10 investors, however, remains bounded. To see this clearly, notice we
                                                                                      ϕ
could decompose V into two components, i.e., V = V10 + V11 , where V10 ≡ α10 G(ε∗10 ) Z and
                   ϕ
V11 ≡ α11 G(ε∗11 ) Z are the contributions to velocity of transactions by agents of type 10, and
agents of type 11, respectively. Explicitly,

    Proposition 8 considers the limiting economy as the fraction of investors who do not have
access to margin loans vanishes, while keeping constant the proportion of investors who can
trade equity. In other words, as α → 0, α10 → 0 and α11 → αs . This limiting economy is one
where it is budget feasible for virtually every investor to finance all their equity purchases by
shorting the bond, i.e., investors can purchase equity shares even if they come into the period
carrying no cash. As explained in the context of Proposition 2, in a monetary equilibrium,
investors of type 10 with relatively low valuation for equity are the ones who always demand
money in the OTC trading round, while investors of type 11 with relatively low valuation
demand money in the OTC round only if 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ (0). Therefore the first-order implication of
letting α10 approach zero is that the extensive margin of money demand from investors of type



                                                    37
10, i.e., the number of type 10 investors who wish to hold money, approaches zero.25
       If the nominal policy rate is relatively low, i.e., if 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ (0) as in part (ii ) of Proposition
8, then the aggregate money demand from type 10 investors vanishes in the limit, but the
aggregate money demand from type 11 investors with low valuation remains positive in the
limit. The reason why money can have value in this limiting economy can be understood
at least from two perspectives. First, money demand can be positive overnight because the
collateral constraint is expected to be binding for type 11 investors, so money can allow them
to take a long position in equity that is larger than the one they would be able to take relying
only on the margin loan.26 Second, low-valuation investors of type 11 are willing to hold cash at
the end of the OTC round because the nominal rate on the bond (i.e., the opportunity cost of
holding cash in the OTC round) is zero when 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ (0); this makes them indifferent between
holding their wealth in money or bonds, and they hold some of each. As a result, in economies
that satisfy 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ (0), i.e., economies with relatively low inflation and relatively low ability
to take on leverage, real balances converge to a positive limit (i.e., (73)), and velocity converges
(i.e., (74)) as α10 → 0.
       If the nominal policy rate is relatively high, i.e., if ς̂ (0) < ι < ς̄ (0) as in part (i ) of
Proposition 8, then real balances converge to zero (i.e., (69)), and transaction velocity goes to
infinity (i.e., (70)) as α10 → 0. The immediate reason for this result is that given this high
policy rate, total money demand in the OTC round vanishes as α01 → 0, for two reasons. First,
low-valuation investors of type 10 would be willing to hold money, but the number of type 10
investors vanishes as α10 → 0. Second, low-valuation investors of type 11 are unwilling to hold
money because money is dominated in rate of return by the collateralized inside bond. Since
virtually nobody wishes to hold money in the OTC round, money has no value in the limiting
economy α10 → 0 with ι ∈ (ς̂ (0) , ς̄ (0)). The key result is that
                                                                 Z ε∗

  25
       The restriction that λ 6= 0 in the statement of Proposition 8 is because, as shown in Figure 1, λ = 0 implies
ς̂ (α) = ς̄ (α) for all α, and therefore in that case monetary equilibrium exists only for ι = ς̂ (α) = ς̄ (α). From
Figure 1 we can also see that λ = 1 implies ς̂ (α) = 0 for all α, so low-valuation investors of type 11 hold money
in the OTC round only if ι = ς̂ (α) = 0. Thus if λ = 1, the range in part (ii) of Proposition 8 collapses to a
single point, and only the parameter region in part (i) is generic in that case.
    26
       Notice that in the range 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ (0), this argument requires λ < 1. The reason is that from Figure 1 we
can see that λ = 1 implies ς̂ (α) = 0 for all α, so low-valuation investors of type 11 hold money in the OTC round
only if ι = ς̂ (α) = 0. In other words, if λ = 1 then the range in part (ii) of Proposition 8 collapses to a single
point (money is only held exactly at the Friedman rule), and only the parameter region in part (i) is generic in
that case.


                                                        38
Notably, even though real balances and velocity converge to their nonmonetary equilibrium
levels as α10 → 0, the real equity price in this cashless limit of the monetary economy exceeds
the (corresponding limit of the) nonmonetary-equilibrium price by the value of a resale-option
term in (77). Since ε∗10 is a function of ι (from (72)), it follows that in the cashless limit the asset
price is still responsive to monetary policy, and that the magnitude of this response remains
bounded away from zero even though the quantity of real balances converges to zero. This result
stands in contrast with the more conventional result that the monetary equilibrium prices and
allocations converge to their nonmonetary equilibrium counterparts when real balances vanish,
e.g., as it happens with the cashless limit in Proposition 7.
   Why does the cashless limit in Proposition 8 not correspond to the nonmonetary equilib-
rium? The answer is in (77) and, at least algebraically, it is simple: because the following
two conditions are met: (a) the limit, as α → 0, of the marginal valuation of investors of
type 10 is strictly larger than εL (i.e., the ε∗10 that solves (72) satisfies εL < ε∗10 , given that
ς̂ (0) < ι < ς̄ (0)), and (b) θ < 1. Condition (a) is a result of the fact that the asset demand
from leveraged high-valuation investors of type 11 sustains an equilibrium asset price in the
limit that is high enough to encourage investors of type 10 with low enough valuations, to sell
the asset for cash at that price. Condition (b) is a parametric condition on the market power
of financial intermediaries. The case with θ = 1 corresponds to a market structure where bond
brokers have no market power to extract intermediation fees, and in this case the equity price
in the cashless limit corresponds to the asset price in the nonmonetary equilibrium. To un-
derstand this result at a conceptual level, it is useful to review the components of the limiting
equity price

The first term is the expected value of the dividend flow. The second term is the investor’s
share θ of the expected value of the pledge option on the asset (i.e., the marginal value to the
investor of the asset when it is pledged as collateral for shorting the bond). The third term is
the investor’s share θ of the expected value of the resale option on the asset. The sum of the
first three terms equals ϕn0 (the nonmonetary equity price in the economy with α = 0). The
fourth term is the key term since it is the component of the asset price that is present in the
cashless limit but not in the nonmonetary equilibrium. This term captures the improvement

                                                  39
in the investor’s bargaining position with the bond dealer due to the fact that the investor’s
outside option is not just autarky, but rather trading in the equity market without access to
bonds. To see this clearly, consider an investor of type 11 who draws ε ∈ [εL , εn ]. He wishes to
sell all his equity and simultaneously bargains with a bond broker to take a long position in the
bond. The investor’s outside option in this bargain is the payoff of trading in the equity market
without access to the bond market. The particular kind of trade that this outside trading option
would entail, depends on the investor’s valuation. If ε ∈ [εL , ε∗10 ], then the investor’s outside
option amounts to acting like an investor of type 10, i.e., selling equity and holding the cash.
                                                      R ε∗
The expected capital gain from reselling the asset is εL10 (ε∗10 − ε) dG (ε), and the bargaining
outcome assigns a fraction 1 − θ of this gain from trade to the investor. This is precisely the
right side of (77), i.e., the additional term in the equity price at the cashless limit.27
    Intuitively, the reason for (77) is that an investor of type 11 with valuation ε ∈ [εL , ε∗10 ] has
the option to sell equity for cash in the equity market, and this option improves his bargaining
position with bond dealers, and allows the investor to earn a larger share of gain from his
portfolio reallocation (from equity to bonds). The key result is then that the value of this option
to the individual investor remains strictly positive in the limit as α → 0, even as the aggregate
real money balances are converging to zero along with the volume of cash transactions in the
equity market. This may seem counterintuitive: why isn’t the value of the investor’s outside
option vanishing in the limit? There are several ways to bring the equilibrium conditions to
clarify these kinds of questions. First, it may help to notice that the trade each individual
investor of type 11 may want to execute in the equity market is infinitesimal, so the investor
of type 11 can always execute it no matter how small the equity market has gotten along the
trajectory toward the cashless limit. The second question that may arise is: if the type 11
investor with valuation ε ∈ [εL , ε∗10 ] where to execute his option to sell his portfolio for cash in
the equity market along the trajectory toward the cashless limit (he actually does not exercise
this option in the equilibrium), who would be on the other side of this transaction buying equity
for cash? The answer is: investors of type 11 with valuations in the interval [ε∗11 , εH ], along
with the very few investors of type 10 with valuations in the interval [ε∗10 , εH ] that are still
around along the trajectory toward the cashless limit. Notice that the latter may be few, but
   27
      If ε ∈ [ε∗10 , εn ], then the investor’s outside option again amounts to acting like an investor of type 10, which in
this case entails buying equity with cash. Hence, since the equity would not be sold for this range of valuations,
it would not deliver a gain associated with reselling, and therefore the investor’s outside option of trading in
the equity market with no access to bonds does not appear in the expected resale value component of the asset.
Algebraically, this is why the upper bound of the integral in (77) is ε∗10 rather than εn .

each is holding strictly positive real balances along the cashless trajectory as α → 0. That is,
although the aggregate real balances are converging to zero (as shown by (69)), the limit of the
real balances per investor of type 10 is strictly positive, i.e.,
                        Z/ϕ            G (ε∗10 )        limα→0 G (ε∗10 )
                     lim    = lim                     =                  > 0.

                                           10 ) α] αs        αs
This is a key difference with the conventional inflationary cashless limit of Proposition 7. In
that case, limι→ῑ(λ) ε∗10 = εL , and therefore

                                   Z/ϕ                  G (ε∗10 )
                            lim        = lim             ∗               = 0,
                           ι→ῑ(λ) α10  ι→ῑ(λ) [1 − G (ε10 )] α10 + α11

which is why the value of the option to sell equity for cash in the equity market (for a low-
valuation investor of type 11) converges to zero in the cashless limit of Proposition 7, and
consequently the equity price in the cashless limit is equal to the equity price in the nonmonetary
equilibrium.
   To summarize, the equilibrium in the cashless limit as α → 0 behaves like this: the resale
value option in (77) is positive because even in the limit, and individual investor of type 11 can
threaten to sell his equity for cash in the equity market, and this off-equilibrium threat improves
his bargaining position with the bond broker allowing the investor to earn a larger share of the
trade surplus. Since the resale value option is positive in the limit, the asset price remains
relatively high, and in particular, higher than the price in the nonmonetary equilibrium (where,
with no cash valued in equilibrium, the investor cannot threaten to sell equity for cash in the
equity market to improve his bargaining position). In other words, there is a discontinuity in
the equilibrium value of this outside option. On the one hand, this outside option is absent in
the nonmonetary equilibrium. On the other hand, in the limit as α → 0, aggregate real balances
converge to 0 but the limit of the value of the outside option to sell equity for cash is positive
for any investor of type 11. Thus the resale value option of the type 11 in (77) is discontinuous
when taking the limit with respect to α10 , and the asset price inherits this discontinuity. In
turn, the relatively high equity price in the cashless limit rationalizes the fact that not all type
10 investors prefer buying equity rather than holding cash in the OTC, which manifests itself
                                                            Z/ϕ
as ε∗10 > εL in the cashless limit, and therefore limα→0    α10   > 0 in the cashless limit.
   To conclude, notice that the result (77) depends on two fundamental features of the envi-
ronment. First, as explained above, bond dealers must have at least some degree of market
power, i.e., we must have θ < 1. Second, investors must have at least some ability to take on

                                                  41
leverage, i.e., we must have λ > 0. This is so because ς̂ (0) ≤ ς̄ (0) for all λ ∈ [0, 1], but with
“=” only if λ = 0, so the parameter region in part (i ) of Proposition 8 collapses to a single
point if λ = 0. But for any positive λ, no matter how small, the region of discontinuity has
positive measure in parameter space.

4.1    Example

In this section we consider the cashless limits for the special case G (ε) = GL I{εL ≤ε<εH } +I{εH ≤ε} ,
for which equilibrium can be solved for in closed form. For the following result, it is useful to
define α10 ≡ αs α, α11 ≡ αs (1 − α), and α01 = 0, with αs ∈ (0, 1], and α ∈ [0, 1]. Let ς̄ (α) and
ς̂ (α) denote the same bounds defined in (47) and (48), but regarded as functions of α, i.e.,
                                  [(1 − α) GL θ + GH ] (εH − εL )
                       ς̄ (α) ≡      ε̄
                                        + (1 − α) θGL (εH − εL )
                                  h αs                       i
                                                           1
                                    α + (1 − α) 1 − θ + θ 1−λ     GH (εH − εL )
                       ς̂ (α) ≡          ε̄                  λ
                                                                                             .
                                        αs    + (1 − α) θGH 1−λ (εH − εL )

Also, assume α01 = 0, so (49) simplifies to λ̂ = GL . In this case,
                                                            λ

    With (80) it is easy to show that limα→0 (ϕ − ϕn ) > 0 for all ι < ς̄ (0). Similarly, (83)
implies limα→0 (ϕ − ϕn ) ≥ 0 for all ι ≤ ς̂ (0) (with “=” only if ι = ς̂ (0)). This example makes
clear that α → 0 implies that the monetary equilibrium disappears in the cashless limit (in the
sense that the value of money converges to zero) only if investors can take on sufficient leverage.
If the borrowing constraints are relatively severe (e.g., λ < GL as in part (ii ) of Proposition 9),
then the monetary equilibrium survives as α → 0, in the sense that real balances approach a
strictly positive limit.


5     Extensions

In this section we consider two extensions of the baseline model. The first generalizes the
model to allow for capital accumulation. This extension allows us to explore the transmission
of monetary policy to asset prices, and in turn, the transmission from asset prices to the real
economy. The second extension verifies the robustness of the cashless limiting results under
an alternative credit arrangement where, rather than having to use the asset as collateral,
investors are able to issue unsecured debt up to a given limit. As with the baseline model, we
formulate these extensions in discrete time, and consider the continuous-time approximation to
characterize equilibrium.

5.1    Capital accumulation

In the baseline model, the number of production units, As , is exogenous and constant. This
means that monetary policy and the details of the OTC marketstructure affect asset prices
but do not affect conventional measures of real economic activity, such as aggregate output or
investment. In this section we endogenize the productive capacity of the economy by letting
agents invest to augment the stock of productive units.


                                                43
    The model is as in Section 2, with the following change. We regard the productive units that
yield the dividend good as a capital stock that can be accumulated. Specifically, in the second
subperiod of period t, investors have access to a production technology that transforms n ∈ R+
units of the general good into x units of capital according to x = ft (n), where the production
function ft is strictly increasing, differentiable, and satisfies ft (0) = limn→∞ ft0 (n) = 0, and
ft0 (0) = ∞. Thus, the value of an investor in the second subperiod is
                                                             Z                      

with at+1 = (ãm        s
               t+1 , ηãt+1 ), ht = h1t + h2t , and xt = ft (h2t ), where ht is the labor input (effort)
devoted to production of general goods (equal to the quantity of general goods produced), h1t
is the quantity of general goods used for consumption, and h2t is the quantity of general goods
used as input to produce new capital, xt . This problem can be written as

                  WtI (at , abt , kt ) = φt at + abt − kt + Tt
                                                              Z                   
                                                                 I

                                        h2t ∈R+

This value function is the same as (8), except for the addition of the last term that represents
the investor’s profit from producing and selling new capital at the market price φst . The optimal
quantity of general goods that the investor devotes to the production of capital goods, i.e., the
h2t that satisfies φst ft0 (h2t ) = 1, is denoted gt (φst ), i.e.,

                                                gt (φst ) ≡ ft0−1 (1/φst ) .                       (84)

The quantity of new capital created by an individual investor is xt (φst ) ≡ ft (gt (φst )). We
can regard xt (φst ) as an individual investor’s contribution to aggregate investment; aggregate
capital investment is
                                                Xt (φst ) ≡ xt (φst ) NI .                         (85)

The assumptions on f imply aggregate investment is increasing in the market price of the equity
shares of capital, i.e.,
                                                           ft0 (gt (φst ))

                                                                  44
The law of motion of the aggregate capital stock is

                                           Ast+1 = η (Ast + Xt ) ,                                         (86)

where Xt is aggregate investment added to the capital stock at the end of period t, and As0 ∈ R+

   The definition of equilibrium for the economy with capital accumulation is the same as
                                                                               ∞

equilibrium with the structure described in Definition 2. A RME is a monetary equilibrium in

For the analysis that follows, we generalize the money supply process of Section 2 to the
following money-growth rule

                                               Amt     Ast
Notice that just as in the model of Section 2, this monetary policy rule implies the gross inflation
rate (as measured by the growth in the nominal price of equity shares) is constant and equal
to µ, i.e., pt+1 /pt = µ. In the special case with Ast = As , (90) reduces to Am     m
                                                                               t+1 /At = µ, namely
the money growth process in our baseline model.
       In a recursive equilibrium (monetary or nonmonetary), once the asset price φs has been
found, aggregate investment is given by Xt = Xt (φs yt ), and the aggregate capital stock follows
the stochastic difference equation Ast+1 = η [Ast + Xt (φs yt )]. If the equilibrium is monetary, once

    Since agents can now augment the stock of productive units, the beginning-of-period exogenous lump-sum
endowment is no longer needed to offset the depreciation in the aggregate capital stock due to the idiosyncratic
obsolesence shock that affects each individual unit of capital.

(ε∗10 , ε∗11 , φs , Z) have been found, the implied equilibrium stochastic processes for the nominal
prices, {pt , φm                                                                ∗     ∗     s
               t , qt }, are given by (87), (88), and (89). Thus along a RME, (ε10 , ε11 , φ , Z, χ11 )
are constant, while nominal prices {pt , φm
                                          t , qt } are random variables whose evolutions over time
are driven by the stochastic dividend process {yt }, and possibly also by transitional dynamics.29
To streamline the presentation, we assume

                           ft (n) = $t nσ , with σ ∈ (0, 1) , and $t ≡ (σyt )−σ .                                (91)

    Let Xt (∆) denote aggregate investment in the recursive equilibrium of the discrete-time
                                                                                          1
economy where the length of the time period is ∆, and let Xt ≡ lim∆→0                     ∆ Xt (∆)   (i.e., Xt is the
investment rate). Then as ∆ → 0, (86) can be approximated by

                                                 Ȧst = Xt − δAst .                                              (92)

Next, we characterize the RNE and RME for the limiting economy as ∆ → 0.

Proposition 10 Consider the limiting economy (as ∆ → 0) with capital accumulation, and
α10 , α11 ∈ (0, 1) R++ .
    (i) There exists a unique recursive nonmonetary equilibrium, (εn , ϕn , X n ). Moreover, (εn , ϕn )
                                                                                               σ

ital stock follows (92) with Xt = X n .
    (ii) If 0 ≤ ι < ῑ (λ), there exists a unique recursive monetary equilibrium, (ε∗10 , ε∗11 , χ, ϕ, Z, X ).
Moreover, (ε∗10 , ε∗11 , χ, ϕ, Z) are as described in Proposition 2, aggregate investment rate is
              σ
X = (ϕ/ρ) 1−σ NI , and the capital stock follows (92) with Xt = X .

    Proposition 10 delivers a link between the asset price, i.e., the relative price of capital in
terms of consumption goods (ϕn in the RNE or ϕ in the RME), and aggregate investment.

5.2     Unsecured credit

In our baseline formulation, we modeled credit in the form of margin loans mainly because
it is the most common form of credit used in financial markets. In this section we verify the
robustness of our main results to an alternative credit arrangement where in the OTC round,
   29
      By way of example, notice that if ft = f and yt = y for all t, then (84) implies aggregate investment
is constant, i.e., Xt (φs yt ) = X (φs y) for all t, and Ast+1 converges monotonically to the unique steady state
        η
Ās = 1−η X (φs y) from any initial condition As0 . Given the deterministic transition path Ast+1 = η [Ast + X (φs y)],

                                t }, and nominal prices {pt , φt , qt }, just follow (90), (87), (88), and (89).

investors are able to issue unsecured debt up to a given limit. The only relevant difference in
the model is that the last constraint in the bargaining problem (5) is replaced by

                                              − B̄t ≤ abt ,                                (93)

where B̄t ≥ 0 is the credit limit faced by an individual agent in the OTC round of period t.
Suppose a broker extends an investor a loan of L dollars in order to purchase A dollars worth
of an asset. Suppose, as will be the case in the model, that the investor chooses to borrow the
maximum amount possible, i.e., L = B̄t . In this case, the margin is M = 1 − B̄t /A, leverage is
              
L = A/ A − B̄t , and the loan-to-value ratio is R = B̄t /A.
   We focus on recursive equilibria. To this end, let
                                                     (pt /qt ) As
                                           B̄t ≡ Λ                                         (94)

                                                  s
for some Λ > 0. In a nonmonetary economy, φ̄t ≡ pt /qt , and therefore (94) amounts to assuming
         s   s
B̄t ≡ Λ φ̄N

             . Formulation (94) corresponds to an economy (monetary or nonmonetary) where
the aggregate real borrowing capacity of investors expressed in terms of general goods, i.e.,
NI B̄t , is a multiple Λ of the real value (expressed in terms of general goods) of the equity
shares outstanding, (pt /qt ) As .
   The structure of the recursive equilibrium is as described in Definition 2 and Definition 3.
We again consider the limiting economy as ∆ → 0, and as before, let ϕ ≡ ρφs , Z ≡ ρZ, and
ι ≡ ip /ρ. For the following result it is convenient to define

       Proposition 11 is analogous to Proposition 8. It considers the limiting economy as the
fraction of investors who do not have access to margin loans vanishes, while keeping constant
the proportion of investors who can trade equity. In other words, as α → 0, α10 → 0 and
α11 → αs .
       For the limiting economy as α → 0, Figure 5 illustrates in the space of parameters ι (vertical
axis) and Λ (horizontal axis), the regions where the equilibria described in parts (i ) and (ii ) of
Proposition 11 exist. Notice that ς̄ 0 and ς̂ 0 are functions of εn , which is in turn a function of Λ,
so to make this dependence explicit, we can write ς̄ 0 (Λ) and ς̂ 0 (Λ). The boundaries ι = ς̄ 0 (Λ)
and ι = ς̂ 0 (Λ) define three regions.30 First, if the nominal policy rate is very high, i.e., if
  30
       It is easy to prove that ς̂ 0 (Λ) ≤ ς̄ 0 (Λ) for all Λ ≥ 0 (with “=” only if Λ = 0), and that
                                                     αs (ε̄ − εL )                  αs [θ (εH − εL ) + (1 − θ) (ε̄ − εL )]
          lim ς̂ 0 (Λ) = 0 < ς̄ 0 (0) = ς̂ 0 (0) =                 ≤ lim ς̄ 0 (Λ) =                                        ,

                                                                   48
ς̄ 0 (Λ) ≤ ι, then the monetary equilibrium does not exist. Second, if the nominal policy rate is
relatively low, i.e., if 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ 0 (Λ) as in part (ii ) of Proposition 11, then the aggregate money
demand from type 10 investors vanishes in the limit, but the aggregate money demand from
type 11 investors with low valuation remains positive in the limit, and therefore real balances
and velocity converge to positive limits. Third, if the nominal policy rate is relatively high,
i.e., if ς̂ 0 (Λ) < ι < ς̄ 0 (Λ) as in part (i ) of Proposition 11, then real balances converge to zero
and transaction velocity goes to infinity as α10 → 0. The economic rationale for these results
is as explained in the context of Proposition 8. And again, the key result is that even though
real balances and velocity converge to their nonmonetary equilibrium levels as α10 → 0, the
real equity price in this cashless limit of the monetary economy exceeds the (corresponding
limit of the) nonmonetary-equilibrium price by the value of a resale-option term. Since ε∗10 is
a function of ι, the asset price is still responsive to monetary policy in the cashless limit, and
that the magnitude of this response remains bounded away from zero even though real balances
converge to zero.


6     Efficiency and welfare

In this section we pose and solve the planner problems corresponding to the baseline model with
fixed capital of Section 2, and the model with capital accumulation of Section 5.1. In both cases
we consider a social planner who wishes to maximize the sum of all agents’ expected discounted
utilities subject to the same meeting frictions that individual agents face in the decentralized
formulation. Specifically, in the first subperiod of every period, the planner can only reallocate
assets among all equity brokers and the measure (α10 + α11 ) NI of investors who contact the
equity market. We restrict attention to symmetric allocations (identical agents receive equal
treatment). For each of the two economies, we also provide a measure of welfare along an
equilibrium path, based on the (equally weighted) sum of all agents’ expected discounted utilities
at the beginning of a period.

second subperiod of period t of an agent of type k ∈ {B, E, I}. Focus on the environment where
only investors are able to carry equity overnight, and let ãIt denote the beginning-of-period t
(before depreciation) equity holding of an individual investor. Let āE
                                                                      t denote the equity holding
of an equity broker at the end of the first subperiod of period t (after OTC trade), and let
āIt denote a measure on F ([εL , εH ]), the Borel σ-field defined on [εL , εH ]. The measure āIt is
interpreted as the distribution of post-OTC-trade asset holdings among investors with different
valuations who contacted an equity broker in the first subperiod of period t.
   With this notation, and letting

and subject to the allocation Π being nonnegative (the expectation operator E0 is with re-
spect to the probability measure induced by the dividend process). The following proposition
characterizes the efficient allocation and the maximum value of the planner’s problem.

function that takes the value 1 if εH ∈ E, and 0 otherwise, for any E ∈ F ([εL , εH ]). The
welfare achieved by the planner is
                                                                       ψ

                                                 ψ ≡ ε̄ + (α10 + α11 ) (εH − ε̄) .                                             (101)

   According to Proposition 12, the optimal allocation is characterized by the following simple
property: among those investors who have a trading opportunity with an equity broker, only
those with the highest valuation hold equity shares at the end of the OTC round of trade. Thus
the planner conducts the optimal reallocation of first-period post-trade asset holdings given the
restrictions of the OTC marketstructure. In this context, ψ can be interpreted as the (flow)
shadow value of the asset for the planner, i.e., it is the analogue of ϕn in Proposition 1 or ϕ in
Proposition 2. Recall that, ϕn ≤ ϕ ≤ ψ (part (i ) of Proposition 3).

    Part (i ) of Corollary 2 corresponds to the parametrizations characterized in part (i ) Propo-
sition 8 for which the limiting economy as α → 0, is cashless. In this case, welfare in the cashless
limit of the monetary economy equals welfare in the nonmonetary equilibrium. Thus, although
monetary policy affects the stock price in the cashless limit (part (i ) of Proposition 8), it does
not affect welfare, which is identical to welfare in an economy with no money. This result is in
part due to the fact that, since the capital stock, As , is exogenous, changes in the market price
of capital, φst , have no effect on the allocation of resources in the cashless limit. This result,
however, is driven by the fact that the capital stock is exogenous in this formulation.

6.2     Economy with capital accumulation

Next, we turn to the efficient allocation for the economy with capital accumulation. As in
Proposition 10, we continue to assume (91). The notation for the planner’s problem is as before,
except that now we use hI1t to denote the quantity of general goods used for consumption, hI2t to
denote the quantity of general goods used as input to produce new capital, and hIt = hI1t + hI2t

rate (i.e., X ∗ ∆ is optimal investment over a time interval of length ∆).

Proposition 13 Consider the limiting economy (as ∆ → 0) with capital accumulation. The

efficient allocation is characterized by the following conditions: (i) āIt (E) =   NI I{εH ∈E}   for all
t, where I{εH ∈E} is an indicator function that takes the value 1 if εH ∈ E, and 0 otherwise,

for any E ∈ F ([εL , εH ]); (ii) X ∗ = (ψ/ρ) 1−σ NI for all t, with ψ given by (101); and (iii) the
capital stock follows (92) with Xt = X ∗ . The welfare achieved by the planner is

   In the setup with capital accumulation the planner optimizes along two margins: the re-
allocation of the asset, and the investment margin. Optimal reallocation in the OTC trading
round is as in the model with exogenous capital, while the optimal investment decision involves
equating the marginal rate of substitution between labor and general goods to the optimal
shadow price of capital, ψ.
   Next, we characterize the welfare function for the economy of Section 5.1). As in Proposition
10, we assume (91).
   In the appendix (part (i ) of Lemma 28), we show that along the path of a RNE of an
economy with capital accumulation, welfare is

    In Corollary 4, the thought experiment consists of taking the limit as α → 0 while keeping
the initial capital stock, As0 , the same. Part (i ) is an economy where money is dominated in rate
of return by bonds (i.e., it corresponds to part (i ) of Proposition 8). In this case, for a given As0 ,
welfare in the cashless limit of the monetary economy is strictly higher than in the nonmonetary
economy, provided θ < 1. In the cashless limit of the monetary economy the equilibrium capital
                                           σ
stock is Ast = e−δt As0 + 1 − e−δt (ϕ̃/ρ) 1−σ NI /δ, while in the nonmonetary economy the capital
                                  
                                              σ
stock is Ast = e−δt As0 + 1 − e−δt (ϕ̃n /ρ) 1−σ NI /δ, so aggregate consumption (of the dividend

good), Ct = yt Ast , is higher in the former.


7    Monetary policy, asset prices, and real activity

In this section we study the effects of monetary policy on asset prices and real activity. We
first characterize optimal monetary policy, and then turn to positive considerations.

Proposition 14 As ι → 0, the recursive monetary equilibrium allocation of the limiting econ-
omy (as ∆ → 0), both with exogenous and with endogenous capital stock, converges to the
efficient allocation.
                                                                                             ∂x y
    Let Ex|y denote the elasticity of variable x with respect to variable y, i.e., Exy ≡     ∂y x .   The
following result characterizes the effect of monetary policy on real asset prices.

   Proposition 15 provides analytical expressions for the elasticity of the asset price, ϕ, with
respect to the policy rate, ι, both for high and low inflation regimes. In every case the elasticity
is negative. In a recursive equilibrium, φm  m     s
                                          t At = ZAt yt , so z ≡ Z/ϕ as given in Proposition
2 is the value of equilibrium real money balances, φm  m
                                                    t At , relative to the value of the total
output, φst Ast , (measured in terms of the dividend good). When written in terms of z, the
expressions indicate that keeping the market structure parameters α10 , α11 , and θ constant,
the impact of monetary policy on asset prices would tend to be larger in economies where
aggregate real balances are a larger fraction of aggregate output. For example, in the economy
with G (ε) = GL I{εL ≤ε<εH } + I{εH ≤ε} (e.g., from part (i ) of Proposition 5),

   The corollary shows that when ι̂ (λ) < ι < ῑ (λ), the elasticity of the asset price with respect
to monetary policy is negative and remains bounded away from zero even as z converges to
zero. For example, in the economy with G (ε) = GL I{εL ≤ε<εH } + I{εH ≤ε} (e.g., from part (i ) of

8         Quantitative analysis

We regard a unit of time as corresponding to one year. The number of outstanding shares is
normalized to 1, i.e., As = 1. The dividend growth rate is independently lognormally distributed
over time, with mean .04 and standard deviation .12 per annum (e.g., as documented in Lettau
and Ludvigson (2005), Table 1). That is, yt+1 = ext+1 yt , with xt+1 ∼ N g, Σ2 , where g =
                                                                               

E (log yt+1 − log yt ) = .04 and Σ = SD (log yt+1 − log yt ) = .12. Over the sample period 1994-
2007, the average nominal policy rate was 4.47% per annum, and the average inflation rate was
2.69% per annum.31 Thus, we set ρp = .0447 and π̄ ≡ π − g = .0269, implying a real rate of
r = ρp − π̄ = .0178 per annum.32 The parameter δ can be taken as a proxy of the riskiness of
stocks; we choose δ = .075, i.e., a productive unit has a 92.5 percent probability of remaining
productive each year. We set λ = .75, which implies a margin requirement of 25 percent.33
         We adopt the formulation α10 ≡ αs α and α11 ≡ αs (1 − α), and set αs = 1. The distribution
of idiosyncratic valuations, G, is assumed to be lognormal, and we normalize ε̄ = 1, i.e.,
ln(ε) ∼ N (− 12 Σ2ε , Σ2ε ). The parameters α, θ, and Σε are calibrated so that, given the rest of
the parametrization, the model is consistent with the following three facts: (a) the real asset
price falls by about 11 basis points in response to a 1 basis point increase in the nominal policy
rate, as in the high-frequency empirical estimates in Lagos and Zhang (2019); (b) transaction
velocity of money is 25 per day, which is the average daily number of times a dollar turns over
    31
      For the policy rate we use the 3-month Eurodollar futures rate (series IEDCS00 produced by
the CME Group available via Datastream).                  The annual average inflation rate is imputed as
[CP I(January 2008)/CP I(January 1994)]1/14 − 1, where CP I(M onth Y ear) is monthly CPI index available
from FRED at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL.
   32
      To streamline the presentation, here we assume r is constant and therefore associate changes in the policy
rate ρp with changes in π. In Lagos and Zhang (2019), which corresponds to a special case of this model with no
credit, i.e., if either λ = 0 or α = 1, we allow for the possibility that when the policy rate changes by ∆ρp , the
real rate changes by ∆r = w∆ρp and the inflation rate changes by ∆π = (1 − w) ∆ρp , where w ∈ [0, 1] indexes
the degree of passthrough from nominal rates to real rates.

      As mentioned in Section 2.2, FINRA Rule 4210 requires that a customer maintains a minimum margin of
25% at all times.

This procedure delivers α = .0406, θ = .1612, and Σε = 2.0784. In Appendix B we assess the
robustness of the quantitative results to alternative calibration strategies.
       Our quantitative exercises consist of reporting asset price responses to changes in ρp for all
(α, λ, θ) ∈ [0, 1]3 . Specifically, we focus on the semi-elasticity of the asset price, φs , with respect
                                                                                         dφs /φs
to the policy rate, ρp . Since the value is always negative, we report S =                dρp      .
       Figure 6 reports S for economies indexed by (α, λ) ∈ [0, 1] × {.50, .75, .90, .99}. Our baseline
calibration ensures that S ≈ 11 for λ = .75 and α = .0406. The main finding is that the
response of the asset price to nominal rate shocks remains significant for a wide range of values
of λ, and even in the pure-credit limiting economy that obtains as α → 0. For example, the
semi-elasticity is even larger than 11 as α → 0 if investors are able to leverage up to 100 times
their wealth. Figure 7 reports S for economies indexed by (α, θ) ∈ [0, 1] × {.16, .25, .70, .99}.
Again, the response of the asset price to nominal rate shocks remains significant in the limiting
economy as α → 0. For example, as α → 0, the semi-elasticity remains above 4 even if investors
are able to capture 70% of the gains in trades intermediated by bond brokers. Figure 8 reports
S for economies indexed by (α, ρp ) ∈ [0, 1] × {.03, .04, .0447, .05}. This exercise shows that
for every level of α, the asset price response tends to be larger in environments with a lower
background nominal policy rate.
       Figures 9, 10, and 11 offer a comprehensive summary of the magnitude of the effects of
monetary policy in limiting economies with α → 0. For a wide range of economies indexed by
a pair ρp and λ, Figure 9 reports the value of S in the pure-credit limit that obtains as α → 0.
The level sets in the right panel show it is not easy to find reasonable parametrizations that
imply a value of S below 5. Figures 10 and 11 tell a similar story. Figure 10, for example,
shows that, as predicted by the theory, S = 0 in the pure-credit cashless limit of economies
with no credit-market frictions or markups, i.e., economies with λ = θ = 1. In contrast, S is
positive and sizable for economies in which is θ < 1, even if 1 − θ is relatively small.

9     Discussion
9.1    On the moneyless approach to monetary economics

Our results on the medium-of-exchange role of money in the transmission of monetary policy
run counter to a large body of work that follows a moneyless approach to monetary economics.
This moneyless approach was advocated by Woodford (1998) and, based on the treatments
in Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008), is now considered by many “the textbook” approach to
monetary theory and practice. The common justification for doing monetary economics without
money is the view that the frictions associated with the medium-of-exchange role are irrelevant
in the transmission of monetary policy. This sweeping view rests on two specific results. Both
results rely on a model where the medium-of-exchange role of money is not explicit, but rather
is proxied by either assuming money is an argument of a utility function, or by imposing that
certain purchases be paid for with cash acquired in advance. The first result is theoretical,
and can be found in Woodford (1998). The second result is quantitative, and can be found in
Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008). We discuss each of these results in turn.
    Woodford (1998) considers a version of the cash-in-advance economy of Lucas (1980) with
“cash goods” and “credit goods” as in Lucas and Stokey (1983), but where the set of cash
goods is represented with a parameter α ∈ (0, γ] for some γ ∈ (0, 1). The economy with
α → γ corresponds to the formulation with no credit goods of Lucas (1980). When α → 0, the
economy is interpreted to be approaching a “cashless limit” where there are no cash goods, i.e.,
a conventional perfectly competitive nonmonetary model without a cash-in-advance constraint.
In this context, the first result in Woodford (1998) is that under the assumption that the money
supply sequence {Mt }∞
                     t=0 satisfies Mt ≥ M for some M > 0 for all t, then there is no monetary
equilibrium in the limiting case α = 0 (in the sense that the nominal price of cash goods,
{pt }∞
     t=0 , diverges to infinity). The second result is that given pt is finite for all α < 0, one cannot
find a solution for the limiting case α = 0 as an approximation to the small-α case. Woodford
interprets this result to mean that in this model “the use of money in transactions is intrinsic to
the model’s ability to determine an equilibrium price level.” Woodford then augments the model
by assuming the government adopts a fiscal-monetary regime that ensures money is valued and
held by private agents even if it is merely a redundant asset. Specifically, the government is
assumed to: (i ) maintain a strictly positive level of nominal government liabilities (so that cash
taxes must be levied on the private sector in order to service the nominal debt), and (ii ) pay


                                                  60
a nominal interest on money balances (equal to the nominal interest on the government debt),
where the nominal interest rate follows an exogenous rule described by a function g (·) of pt ,
assumed to be continuously differentiable in the neighborhood of some p∗ , with g (p∗ ) chosen
to ensure that money is held in the equilibrium of the economy with α = 0 (i.e., to ensure the
Euler equation for money holds with equality, and the relevant transversality condition satisfied
given pt+1 = pt = p∗ for all t). Condition (ii ) effectively makes money and bonds the same
asset (with the same rate of return), which ensures private agents are willing to hold money
even though it is not useful in transactions. Notice that since money plays no role as a medium
of exchange, there is no demand of money for private transactions that can be equated to the
money supply to determine pt . Condition (i ), however, amounts to assuming a private-sector
demand for money needed to meet the nominal tax liabilities with the government; this tax-
induced money demand allows the price level, pt , to be determined using the government budget
constraint. In the context of the cash-credit cash-in-advance model under the fiscal-monetary
regime described by conditions (i ) and (ii ), Woodford shows the central approximation result
of his paper, namely that the equilibrium is continuous in the parameter α, i.e., the equilibrium
of the economy with α = 0 can be well approximated by the equilibrium of an economy with
positive but small enough value of α.
   Hence, against the background of a cash-in-advance economy subject to assumptions (i )
and (ii ), the cashless limit just described, i.e., the economy with α = 0 where money is a
redundant asset with no role in exchange, can be regarded as a good approximation to a
monetary economy where money is needed to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint but only for
a very small set of goods, i.e., the economy with α is positive but very small. Since there are no
monetary variables in the Euler equations of the limiting economy, this approximation result
is used to justify neglecting monetary variables in Euler equations more generally, alluding to
economies with “highly developed financial institutions” (meaning economies with low α). In
this context, for the Euler equations for other durable assets, ignoring monetary variables is
equivalent to simply assuming a period utility function of the form U (c, m) = u (c) + Av (m) of
consumption, c, and real money balances, m, for given functions u (·) and v (·), and a constant
A ∈ R+ . Thus, the Woodford cashless-limit approximation result is often used to justify this
specific money-in-the-utility-function formulation, sometimes with A ≈ 0. In sum, the takeaway
of Woodford (1998) is that the cashless equilibrium in the limiting case, which is independent
of money demand for transactions, can be used to approximate the monetary equilibrium in


                                               61
any case in which medium-of-exchange frictions exist but are small.
   The textbook treatments of monetary policy in Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008) assign a
very limited role to money. For the most part, the medium-of-exchange role is either ignored,
or when it is acknowledged, it is incorporated implicitly by assuming real money balances as
an argument of the agents’ utility functions (or some equivalent cash-in-advance formulation).
The preferred specification is U (c, m) = u (c) + Av (m). This separable specification is justified
by showing that, in the context of a competitive model with no credit frictions, if U (c, m) is
nonseparable, then the elasticity of output with respect to a monetary shock that raises the
nominal interest rate by one percentage point is proportional to inverse velocity, Mt / (pt Yt ),
where Mt /pt denotes aggregate real money balances, and Yt denotes GDP. Woodford (2003,
p. 113) and Gali (2008, p. 31) argue that since Mt / (pt Yt ) is small in the data (e.g., with Mt
interpreted as the monetary base), the effect of monetary policy on output that is attributable
to monetary frictions is quantitatively small so it can be ignored, e.g., by considering the simpler
formulation U (c, m) = u (c) + Av (m), often even assuming A ≈ 0.
   The literature mentions several reasons why it may be interesting to study monetary policy
in limit cashless economies such as the one with α → 0 in Woodford (1998). The first, as
argued by Woodford (1998, p. 174), is that the hypothetical cashless limit may one day become
a reality as a result financial innovations that continually reduce the quantity of the monetary
base that needs to be held on average to carry out a given volume of transactions: “The only
natural limit to this process is an ideal state of frictionless financial markets in which there is
no positive demand for the monetary base at all, if it is dominated by other financial assets,
and no determinate demand for it if it is not.” The second, is that the cashless limit may be
a useful thought experiment, as argued by Wicksell (1898, p. 70) when considering his “pure
credit economy,” defined as:

         “... a state of affairs in which money does not actually circulate at all, neither in
      the form of coin (except perhaps as small change) nor in the form of notes, but where
      all domestic payments are effected by means of the Giro system and bookkeeping
      transfers. A thorough analysis of this purely imaginary case seems to me to be
      worth while, for it provides a precise antithesis to the equally imaginary case of a
      pure cash system, in which credit plays no part whatsoever. The monetary systems
      actually employed in various countries can then be regarded as combinations of these
      two extreme types. If we can obtain a clear picture of the causes responsible for the

                                                62
       value of money in both of these imaginary cases, we shall, I think, have found the
       right key to a solution of the complications which monetary phenomena exhibit in
       practice.”

    The cashless limit we considered (e.g., Proposition 8) is in the spirit of Wicksell’s “pure
credit economy” and in line with the motivation for Woodford’s cashless limit. Generically,
however, our results stand in contrast with Woodford’s: we find that in general the medium-
of-exchange role of money is important for monetary transmission, and remains a significant
conduit for monetary policy even in the cashless limit. As α → 0, real balances converge to
zero, transaction velocity goes to infinity, and the monetary economy converges to a limit where
monetary policy still has significant effects on welfare, asset prices, consumption, investment,
and output. There is one special case of our theory that delivers irrelevance results for the
medium-of-exchange role of money in the cashless limit that are similar to Woodford’s. It is
the case where financial intermediaries have no market power, i.e., θ = 1. So, in order to
argue that monetary frictions are irrelevant in cashless limiting economies or almost irrelevant
near-cashless economies, it is necessary to also adopt the view that investors are always able to
reap the entire share of the gains from trade when interacting with intermediaries in financial
markets.35 Our theoretical point here is that θ = 1 is nongeneric. Whether the perfectly
competitive case with θ = 1 is the relevant case for applied work, is likely to be ultimately
an empirical issue that deserves further study. We are aware of no evidence that θ = 1 is the
norm empirically, even in the financially advanced economies with low levels inverse velocity of
the monetary base that Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008) argue are well approximated by the
moneyless approach to monetary policy.36
    For θ < 1, our theory provides counterexamples to the typical claims (based on the reduced-
form arguments outlined above) commonly used to endorse the moneyless approach. For exam-
   35
      Our formulation also assumes individual investors are subject to borrowing limits; a collateral constraint in
the model of Section 2, and a given borrowing limit in the model of Section 5.2). This can be interpreted as a
second departure from what may be described as “frictionless financial markets.” However, our cashless results
hold even if λ → 1 in the economy of Section 2, and if Λ → ∞ in the economy of Section 5.2.
   36
      Notice that for a given θ < 1, our cashless limiting economy is different depending on the underlying
monetary policy, ι, and credit conditions, as captured by λ in the baseline model. If the policy rate and leverage
are relatively large as in part (i) of Proposition 8 then money is dominated in rate of return, real balances
converge to zero, and asset prices respond to ι even in the cashless limit. If the policy rate and leverage are
relatively low as in part (ii) of Proposition 8, then as α → 0, real balances are not dominated in rate of return, do
not converge to zero, and monetary policy remains effective in the limit. In both cases our conclusions regarding
the effects of ι on prices and allocations in the pure-credit limiting economy is clearly at odds with the limiting
irrelevance result in Woodford (2003).

ple, Woodford (2003, p. 32) claims that the basic model in his book “abstracts from monetary
frictions, in order to focus attention on more essential aspects of the monetary transmission
mechanism...”. Gali (2008, p. 10) claims that “...there is generally no need to specify a money
demand function, unless monetary policy itself is specified in terms of a monetary aggregate, in
which case a simple log-linear money demand schedule is postulated.” The results we presented
above (in particular those in Section 7 and Section 8) and in related work (Lagos and Zhang,
2019) indicate that traditional medium-of-exchange considerations are in fact an essential as-
pect of the monetary transmission mechanism—even in the cashless limit or in near-cashless
economies in which liquidity-saving mechanisms have developed sufficiently to make the inverse
velocity of the monetary base very small. Any attempt to assess the macroeconomic effects of
monetary policy without such considerations is necessarily incomplete.

9.2    On reduced-form models of money demand

There are well known critiques of reduced-form models of money. Kareken and Wallace (1980)
for example, state two. The first, is that assuming money is an argument of a utility (or a
production) function is an instance of “implicit theorizing,” by which they mean that while there
may be stories that can be told to justify the approach (e.g., that money provides unmodelled
transaction services), the assumptions implicit in these stories cannot be regarded as primitives,
and unless the underlying environment is made explicit, the internal consistency of the theory
cannot be assessed. The second criticism is that reduced-form specifications beg too many
questions; explain too little. What is the thing called “money”? Is it a private liability? A
government liability? A commodity? If it is a government liability, which one? If there are
many countries, does the liability issued by the government of country A enter the utility
function of a citizen of country B? Compelling as they may be, these two criticisms are ignored
in most of applied monetary economics. The reason, we suspect, is that these criticisms may
not seem too serious in practice. Suppose one wants to study the effects of a monetary policy
shift in an advanced economy like the United States. The common practitioner’s view would
be that in this context, there are some reasonable choices for the assets that play the role of
money, and that the unmodelled medium-of-exchange frictions subject to the Kareken-Wallace
implicit theorizing critique are likely to be small anyway.37
  37
     The arguments of the reduced-form utility functions used in practice, typically include real money balances
(e.g., as in Sidrauski (1967), Gali (2008), and Woodford (2003)), but also government bonds, equity shares, and
other financial assets (e.g., as in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)).


                                                      64
    The near-cashless results in Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008) differ from ours because they
rely on a money-in-the-utility (MIU) formulation that can sometimes fail to capture important
aspects of the role money plays in transactions. For this reason it may be useful to show the
limitations of their reduced-form approach in the context of our economic environment. We want
to stress that these limitations are relevant even after we have agreed on which assets should
be included in the utility function, and remain relevant even for practical, routine questions in
monetary policy in the context of advanced economies with highly developed liquidity-saving
mechanisms and credit-based payment arrangements resulting in low aggregate real balances.
    The equilibrium conditions for our model can be obtained from the following reduced form:

If we focus on a recursive equilibrium of the discrete-time economy with period length ∆, and

If money is held, (126) and (127) imply

                                                             = ι.
                                                     ε̄ + us
The right side of this condition is the opportunity cost of carrying a dollar between periods,
and the left side is the marginal rate of substitution between money and equity.
       If we substitute (124) and (125), (126) and (127) become identical to the last two conditions
in Lemma 13, so formulation (122) is in this sense equivalent to our micro model of investor
behavior. Hence, we can define recursive equilibrium as before: a vector, (ε∗10 , ε∗11 , ϕ, Z), that
satisfies the first two conditions in Lemma 13, together with (126) and (127) (taking into account
that uz and us are given by (124) and (125)).
       Suppose instead, that we regard uz and us as a pair of fixed parameters, as would be
the case in a prototypical MIU formulation that ignores all the micro details of the OTC
trading round, and instead proxies for them with a utility function U given by (123) that is
taken parametrically and is meant to capture the “convenience yield” or “liquidity services” of
certain assets. One obvious problem with this approach is that, instead of regarding U as an
indirect utility function (i.e., and equilibrium object) it treats U as if it were a primitive, i.e.,
exogenous and invariant to changes in the policy and marketstructure parameters. In contrast,
in a structural micro-founded model such as the one we develop in Section 2, changes in the
policy rate ι, credit conditions λ, and marketstructure parameters (αks )k,s∈{0,1} and θ, change
  38
    Instead of using x to index U , we could use the set of all parameters, Π = (β, η, γ̄, G, θ, (αks )k,s∈{0,1} , λ, µ)
since the equilibrium objects (φs , ε∗10 , ε∗11 ) are themselves constant functions of Π in a recursive equilibrium.

the shape of the indirect utility function U through their effects on x, or more explicitly,
through their effects on uz and us , that are functions of those parameters, as is clear from
(124) and (125). An equilibrium for the MIU economy would be a pair, (ϕ, Z), that satisfies
(126) and (127) taking uz and us parametrically. For this MIU economy, the equilibrium is
simple: The equity price is given explicitly by (127); it consists of the expected dividend, ε̄,
and the “convenience yield” of equity, us . A robust feature of this formulation (exploited in the
work that advocates studying monetary policy ignoring money-demand considerations) is that
because U is separable in real balances, the equilibrium level of real balances plays no role in the
determination of the rest of the equilibrium. In this case, for instance, the real asset price, ϕ,
is independent of Z and therefore, independent of the policy rate, ι. Equilibrium real balances
are given by (126), namely, monetary equilibrium exists only if ι = uz /ϕ, and in this case the
equilibrium aggregate real balance is any Z ∈ [0, ∞).39 The upshot is that the properties of the
equilibrium prices (ϕ, Z) that result from treating U as a primitive are in general very different
from the properties of the equilibrium prices of the model where the role of money and equity
in the exchange process is accounted for explicitly.
    Obvious though this “Lucas critique” type of observation may be, it also turns out to be a
critical shortcoming of the reduced-form approach, especially when used to draw conclusions on
the importance of the medium-of-exchange function of money and its role in the transmission
of monetary policy. To give a concrete example, based on the MIU formulation one would
conclude that ϕ is independent of monetary policy. However, once the exchange process through
which money yields liquidity services is spelled out, e.g., as in the model of Section 2, one
learns that ϕ is decreasing in ι because us is really a decreasing function of ι. As another
example, consider a cashless limit or a near-cashless economy like the ones often used to justify
ignoring monetary frictions in the New Keynesian textbooks. The way such a cashless limit
(e.g., resulting from a sequence of improvements in liquidity-saving mechanisms or credit-based
payment arrangements) can be captured in the reduced-form model is by driving the marginal
value of real balances to zero in the assumed utility function. For example, in our case with U
given by (123), suppose we start with a policy rate consistent with monetary equilibrium, i.e.,
ι = uz /ϕ. Then as the parameter uz is reduced, real balances go to zero but this has no effect
on the rest of the equilibrium; in particular the real equity price (127) is unchanged because us
  39
     The indeterminacy of Z in the monetary equilibrium in this example is due to the fact that U is not only
separable, but also linear in real balances. If U where separable but not linear in real balances, then (127) would
be unchanged and (126) (at equality) would determine a unique Z.


                                                        67
is taken to be a parameter in the MIU formulation. The irrelevance of the medium-of-exchange
role of money is as strong as it can be in this MIU formulation: the rest of the equilibrium (i.e.,
asset prices, and in the model with capital accumulation, also consumption, investment, and
output) are invariant to Z in the cashless limit, but also away from it. In the micro-founded
model, in contrast, us is a function of the credit conditions λ, the marketstructure parameters
(αks )k,s∈{0,1} and θ, and in particular a function of the policy rate ι—even in the cashless limit,
e.g., as Z → 0 because α → 0 as in part (i ) of Proposition 8.
   In sum, the widespread New Keynesian view that medium-of-exchange monetary frictions
are unimportant for monetary transmission relies on two irrelevance results that are based
on: (i ) a reduced-form specification of cash and credit transactions that fails to capture the
effects of monetary policy on prices and allocations that remain significant even in near-cashless
economies, and (ii ) a presumption that the financial markets implicit in the reduced-form
specification are frictionless (and in particular that investors are always able to reap the entire
share of the gains from trade when trading with intermediaries in those unmodelled cash and
credit markets).
   We have shown that if the role of money as a medium of exchange is modeled explicitly,
and financial markets exhibit realistic frictions (e.g., credit takes the form of collateralized loans
intermediated by brokers who have at least some degree of market power), then monetary policy
conducted by means of changing a nominal interest rate is transmitted to the real allocations—
even in the cashless limit, i.e., even if access to credit is so generalized that real balances are
negligible. Along this cashless limit, the path of the monetary aggregate becomes irrelevant
but the monetary frictions that give money value as a medium of exchange remain important
for the transmission of monetary policy. These monetary frictions are resilient in that they
remain operative even when real balances are negligible as is the case in the cashless limit. To
summarize, these results are different from those obtained from reduced-form models because:
(i ) the true indirect utility function for money and consumption is changing along the cashless
limit, so MIU formulations that assume the utility function is stable to policy or changes in the
market structure are not be able represent the limit of the monetary equilibrium of a model such
as ours, where money and intermediated credit help agents overcome commitment and double-
coincidence-of-wants frictions; and (ii ) the financial market in our model is not frictionless:
credit is limited and involves intermediaries who have some degree of market power.

9.3       Price level determination in the cashless limit

The price level determination in limiting cashless economies is a recurrent theme in Woodford
(2003), so for comparison purposes, it may be useful to explain the behavior of the price level
along the cashless limit of our economy. In a RME, the price level (measured by the nominal
price of equity shares) is40

By choosing the level of M0 , the monetary authority can implement any price level in the RME
of the cashless limiting economy. Intuitively, the monetary authority can always implement a
price level that remains well defined (i.e., finite) even in the cashless limit, simply by keeping
the money supply per investor of type 10 stable along the cashless limit.

10    Conclusion

We conclude by mentioning what we think are three promising avenues for future work. First,
the model we have presented is tailored to the transmission of monetary policy that operates
through financial markets. We have chosen this route guided by the empirical and quantitative
results in Lagos and Zhang (2019). Here we have shown how, through its effect on asset prices,
monetary policy ultimately influences aggregate consumption, investment, and output. With
some minor changes, our theory could be reinterpreted as a model of trade in an input that is
reallocated across production units with different productivities. This alternative formulation
would imply a more direct transmission of money shocks to the real economy. Second, our model
offers a leverage-based theory of transaction velocity, a variable that is empirically relevant
yet difficult to model satisfactorily in more conventional monetary models. Third, the model
implications for how asset prices and their responses to monetary policy shocks depend on
credit conditions and leverage could lead to fruitful empirical work.

     Figure 5: Existence regions for monetary equilibrium in the limit as α → 0 for the economy with unsecured credit
     (general, continuous distribution of valuations, G). There is no monetary equilibrium in the shaded region. Nonmonetary
     equilibrium exists everywhere. Along a monetary equilibrium, real balances Z converge to 0 if ς̂ 0 (Λ) < ι < ς̄ 0 (Λ) and to
     a positive level if 0 < ι ≤ ς̂ 0 (Λ).
