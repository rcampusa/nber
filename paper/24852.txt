Since 2011, when the landmark “Dear Colleague” letter declared that the Department of
Education (DoE) would use equal-access requirements of federal law to remediate sexual assault
on college campuses, 458 investigations have been opened. This letter was withdrawn in 2017
and it remains uncertain how the DoE will handle the issue in the future. We examine the effects
of the investigations arising from the 2011 policy change on university outcomes. We find that
applications and enrollment increase in response to Title IX investigations, for both males and
females. We find little evidence of effects on degree completion or donations.

    Any Press is Good Press? The Unanticipated Effects of
        Title IX Investigations on University Outcomes

    By JASON M. LINDO, DAVE E. MARCOTTE, JANE E. PALMER, AND ISAAC D. SWENSEN *

            Since 2011, when the landmark “Dear Colleague” letter declared that
            the Department of Education (DoE) would use equal-access
            requirements of federal law to remediate sexual assault on college
            campuses, 458 investigations have been opened. This letter was
            withdrawn in 2017 and it remains uncertain how the DoE will handle the
            issue in the future. We examine the effects of the investigations arising
            from the 2011 policy change on university outcomes. We find that
            applications and enrollment increase in response to Title IX
            investigations, for both males and females. We find little evidence of
            effects on degree completion or donations.



        In September 2017, Secretary Betsy DeVos formally withdrew an influential but
controversial policy providing guidance on the responsibilities of the U.S. Department of
Education (DoE) to monitor how American colleges and universities investigate and resolve
sexual assault cases involving students. 1 This rescission of a policy, which was put in place
during the administration of President Obama by a “Dear Colleague” letter (DCL) from the
Office of Civil Rights (OCR), was momentous because it ended what had been steady, if halting,
advances in federal action to prevent and respond to sexual assault and protect victims. In
particular, “Dear Colleague” policy guidance marked the advent of the use of equal access
requirements of federal law to bring attention and remediation to sexual assault on college
campuses. When the DCL was released in 2011, there were only a handful of schools under
investigation by OCR. By June 2017, that number had grown to more than 400 (Brown, 2017).
Since the September 2017 withdrawal of the OCR guidance, the rate of federal investigations of
how universities respond to Title IX cases has slowed considerably—13 new investigations were
initiated in the 6 months following that action, compared to 44 investigations over the same
period the previous year (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2018).

         Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty about what the policy will look like in the
future. In October 2017, the OCR released a “Q&A” on the matter of Title IX investigations
pertaining to sexual harassment. This Q&A document provides interim guidance for universities
while the DoE conducts “rulemaking on the topic of schools’ Title IX responsibilities concerning
complaints of sexual misconduct, including peer-on-peer sexual harassment and sexual
violence.” This rulemaking process is scheduled to conclude with the announcement of new
guidance on Title IX claims sometime in 2018.
         While current policy is in limbo, in this paper we evaluate the impacts of Title IX
investigations for sexual assault as implemented following the 2011 DCL. That period ushered in
an era of unprecedented attention to matters of sexual assault on college campuses in the United
States. We examine the effects of this attention on college applications, enrollment, degree
completion and alumni giving. This is important both to evaluate the impacts of a major policy
decision in higher education and also to potentially to inform the evolving oversight
responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Education. 2
         There are three types of mechanisms through which Title IX investigations can affect
prospective and current students, and alumni: information, salience, and change. First, these
investigations may reveal characteristics about colleges and universities that are typically hard to
measure. Because these investigations are based on complaints that instances of sexual violence
were not properly investigated or adjudicated, they may signal that a college or university is not
safe or does not take sexual assault seriously. Perversely, investigations may provide information
about the college atmosphere that is desirable to some individuals, e.g., party culture. 3 A salience
mechanism could be relevant if a Title IX investigation increases the likelihood that time- and
attention-limited individuals consider the institution when making decisions about where to
apply, or where to make donations. Finally, Title IX investigations may change universities in
ways that matter to students and other interested parties. Perhaps most immediately, one might
expect federal investigations to improve the way sexual violence cases are investigated and
adjudicated. Secretary DeVos and others offer a more pessimistic view, however, in highlighting
that Title IX investigations may suppress the rights of the accused and may lead to an

2 Other researchers have recently examined the impacts of females’ participation in sports resulting from Title IX.
Baker and Cornelson (2016) find little evidence of effects on the spatial skills associated with women’s occupations.
Schulkind (2017) finds that babies born to women with greater athletic opportunities as teenagers are healthier at
birth.

atmosphere of sexual “paranoia” on campus (Kipnis, 2017). It is certainly important to consider
how federal investigations may act as an agent for broader changes to institutions. Federal
attention could intensify student- and/or university-led sexual violence prevention and response
efforts, perhaps with negative unintended consequences along the lines that DeVos suggested.
Federal investigations may also put pressure on administrators to improve the university in other
ways, such as attempting to offset the negative publicity associated with the investigation with
changes in an institution’s marketing and outreach efforts.
       In this paper, we bring together data from several sources in order to study the overall
effects of Title IX investigations by OCR. We do so using event-study methods that quantify
how these outcomes deviate from expected levels leading up to and following the opening of a
federal investigation. Information on OCR’s Title IX investigations is based on the Chronicle of
Higher Education’s Title IX Tracker database. We confirm that openings of investigations are
salient using data on Google searches for college names combined with rape. We then use panel
data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and from the Council
for Aid to Education’s Voluntary Support of Education Survey (VSES) to evaluate the impacts
on applications, enrollment, degree completion, and alumni giving.
       We find no evidence federal Title IX investigations reduce students’ interest in a
university. Instead, we find evidence that these investigations increase freshman applications and
enrollment, for both female and male students. Federal Title IX investigations appear to have no
effect on student retention, as the enrollment of continuing students is unaffected. We also find
no effects on rates of degree completion. Our analysis of VSES data suggests that federal Title
IX investigations have no detectable effects on donations. Interestingly, these same data indicate
that institutions respond to these investigations by soliciting donations from more alumni.
       Though we are unable to determine the exact mechanisms underlying these results, the
pattern of the estimates is informative. The evidence that OCR’s Title IX investigations generate
immediate increases in applications of both males and females in the short run suggests that
investigations do not deter students from applying for admission, or that the number of deterred
students is dwarfed by the number of additional students who become interested because of
increased salience, changes at the institution, or intensified marketing efforts by the institution.
The fact that we find similar effects for female and male students suggests that the primary
mechanism is not gender-specific, so changes in safety, or perceptions about safety, are also



                                                 3
unlikely to play a central role. This interpretation is further supported by our evidence that Title
IX investigations do not affect persistence at the university. It seems that colleges and
universities intensify their outreach efforts as a result of being under investigation, which is
evident from our estimated effects on solicitations to alumni. This may explain why we do not
find evidence of significant reductions in giving to universities resulting from investigations.
Moreover, given that colleges and universities appear to intensify their outreach efforts directed
at alumni, there is reason to believe that they may do similarly for prospective students.
However, our interviews with admissions officers indicated that they did not. For this reason, we
believe that direct effects of Title IX investigations on salience is the most plausible explanation
for their surprising effects on student applications and enrollment.
       Our use of the word “salience” here is in the same spirit as Tversky and Kahneman’s
(1974) description of “availability” or “retrievability.” They point out that the ease with which
something comes to mind may lead to behavioral biases. In our context, the publicity generated
by a federal Title IX case could increase the likelihood that a school comes to mind when
students form their consideration set. And this effect could dominate any negative effects
associated with the associated with the investigation.
       The idea that the salience of a college can have real effects is consistent with prior
research. Indeed, Anderson (2017) documents that donations and applications increase as a result
of as-good-as-random college football game outcomes. Moreover, this sort of behavior is
consistent with evidence that many individuals do not make optimal decisions regarding college
applications and college attendance. For example, a majority of very high-achieving low-income
students do not apply to selective colleges despite the fact that they would often cost them less
after financial aid (Hoxby and Avery 2013), though this can in part be overcome by providing
assistance with the application process and information on financial aid (Bettinger et al. 2012;
Hoxby and Turner 2013; Barr and Turner 2017).


                                          I. Background
                                   A. Sexual Assault Incidence
       Campus sexual assault has long been a subject of study. In the first major study on sexual
assault victimization among college women, Koss, Gidycz and Wisniewski (1987) estimated that
more than one in four college women had experienced attempted or completed rape. While Koss



                                                 4
et al. (1987) measured victimization since the age of 14, not just since date of college
matriculation, their estimates were quite similar to later estimates focusing only on victimization
during college. For example, the National College Women Sexual Victimization study estimated
that 20 – 25% of women would experience attempted or completed rape while attending college
(Fisher, Cullen & Turner, 2000); Krebs, et al. (2007) found that approximately 20% of college
seniors at two large public universities experienced sexual assault; and Kilpatrick et al. (2007)
found that 5.2% of a national sample of 2,000 college women experienced completed rape using
force or incapacitation in the past academic year, which over four years would be comparable to
earlier estimates. More recently, the Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation Survey, a
nationally representative phone survey of over 1,000 current and recent undergraduates
conducted in 2015, documented similar victimization rates to Krebs, et al. (2007) while the AAU
Campus Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct, a web-based survey of over 150,000
students administered at 27 universities in 2015, estimated a rate of 23.1 percent female
undergraduate students reporting experiencing sexual assault or sexual misconduct (Cantor, et
al., 2015). Although these rates have been generally consistent, estimates of sexual victimization
can sometimes be difficult to compare because studies vary in their reporting periods, survey
response rates, and their measures of sexual victimization (Fedina, Holmes & Backes, 2016).


                     B. Policy Context Prior to the “Dear Colleague” Letter
       The history of federal legislation to protect college students from criminal victimization
begins with the Clery Act of 1990. The main provision of Clery requires colleges and
universities to make crime statistics publicly available and to issue timely warnings of any
ongoing threats to the campus population (US Department of Education, 2016). Yet, institutions
have a disincentive to encourage students to report, since publicly available crime statistics may
affect public perceptions of the institution and future enrollment. Critics have described the Clery
Act as symbolic rather than substantial (Fisher, Hartman, Cullen & Turner, 2002). The statistics
that colleges and universities report for Clery are not inclusive of all crimes involving students,
because they are only required to report crimes that occurred on or near campus or campus
property, even if those crimes were committed or perpetrated against individuals unaffiliated
with the university. This means that reported data does not distinguish between dangerous
campuses and dangerous cities in which colleges are situated. A further complication arises



                                                 5
because of the general reluctance of students to report sexual assault to authorities (Fisher et al.,
2000). As a result, higher sexual assault statistics may be indicators of a campus climate
conducive to increasing student willingness to report assaults, rather than underlying
victimization rates (Cantalupo, 2011; Palmer & Alda, 2016).
           The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), first authorized in 1994 as part of the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (H.R. 3355), supplemented federal law to
protect students (and others) on college and university campuses (Dunn, 2013; Schroeder, 2013).
In addition to granting funds to on-campus programs to prevent and respond to victimization, the
law also requires colleges and universities to offer sexual assault prevention programs for all
incoming students and new employees. In addition, the 2013 reauthorization of VAWA amended
the Clery Act to outline several procedural requirements related to adjudication processes in
cases of student victimization to assure transparency; a prompt, fair and impartial proceeding;
and also confidentiality for the victim. 4


          C. The “Dear Colleague Letter” and The Use of Title IX to Address Sexual Assault
           In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education’s OCR released the DCL 5 that clarified the
requirements of Title IX in the context of sexual violence at all public and private schools,
colleges and universities that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX is a civil rights law
passed as part of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972 to assure equal access to education.
The initial implementation of this law focused on female students’ access to sports and equitable
athletic facilities. Over time, the law was interpreted to include other forms of sex-specific
discrimination that affect female students’ equal access to education. The OCR is responsible for
investigating any complaint that an educational institution violated Title IX.
           The DCL clarified that Title IX required a prompt and equitable investigation if the
school is aware of an allegation of sexual harassment or sexual violence. If a school “knows or
reasonably should know” of an instance of sexual harassment or sexual violence, it was required
to immediately complete a “prompt, thorough, and impartial” investigation. Any adjudication
process was to use a preponderance of evidence standard, which is a lower burden of proof than
the beyond a reasonable doubt standard used for sexual assault cases in the criminal justice

                                                        6
system. If the adjudication process resulted in a finding that sexual violence occurred, the
institution was required to “take immediate action to eliminate the hostile environment, prevent
its reoccurrence, and address its effects” (DCL, 2011, p.15). If a victim or the accused believed
any of these steps were not followed adequately, she or he could elect to file a complaint with
OCR within 180 days. If OCR determined the college or university did not respond promptly and
equitably, that served as a potential indication that the institution violated Title IX. Schools
found to be non-compliant could face fines, lose federal funding and be required to take steps to
remedy or correct their response to sexual violence.


                                D. Title IX and Public Awareness
       The OCR’s action was largely in response to growing public attention to the issue of
campus sexual assault and how it was being handled. In 2010, National Public Radio and the
Center for Public Integrity released a series on failure by colleges to protect women from campus
rape. Their investigations found that colleges rarely expelled those accused of sexual assault and
prevention programs put the responsibility on women to prevent rape. They presented their
findings directly to the Assistant Secretary for OCR, who committed to more aggressively
address sexual violence on college campuses (NPR, 2010). More recent examples of public
attention include the 2015 documentary film The Hunting Ground, which offered several
survivors’ perspectives of how their universities did not properly respond to their allegations of
sexual assault, and follows two activists who began to teach their peers how to file a complaint
with the OCR. The same year a widely read book on the handling of sexual violence cases by the
University of Montana and the local police helped to further raise the public’s awareness of the
institutional protectionism and inadequate response that many students face when they report
sexual violence to university administrators (Krakauer, 2015).
       The OCR’s increase in Title IX investigations has focused substantial attention on issues
of climate and safety for female students. In the years after the DCL, each new investigation was
widely covered in national news, especially at elite institutions, and the Chronicle of Higher
Education has devoted special attention to each case. In May of 2014, for the first time ever,
OCR made public the list of 55 higher educational institutions with open Title IX investigations




                                                7
related to sexual violence. As of May, 2018, 458 sexual assault investigations had been opened at
American colleges and universities under Title IX. Of these, only 121 cases have been resolved. 6
           Unlike Clery, which provides general information about crime statistics, this increase in
OCR Title IX investigations focused attention on sexual assault at specific institutions, how these
schools handled victims’ complaints and how they treated the accused. Consequently, OCR Title
IX investigations may have caused real concern about school climate. These cases may have
been seen as warning signs about the extent of sexual victimization on a given campus and the
degree to which students’ complaints are taken seriously and judiciously processed.
           Of course, the actions of a federal department in Washington DC to announce
investigations may be of little notice by prospective and current college students or their parents.
We know of no reliable data on the awareness of these issues for representative students at
colleges under investigation or elsewhere. For this reason, before examining the impacts on
various university outcomes, we begin our analysis by evaluating the salience of these
investigations using data on Google searches for college names combined with key words
associated with sexual assault.


                                                  II. Data
           Our data on Title IX investigations are based on the Title IX Tracker database, compiled
by the Chronicle of Higher Education from Freedom of Information Act requests of the U.S.
Department of Education. These data include the date on which the OCR determined that a
complaint against an institution had merit and opened an investigation into its handling of a case
of sexual violence. The first investigation in the Title IX Tracker database was opened in August
of 2008. Our analysis uses data on all investigations that were opened between January of 2010
and July of 2014 to correspond to our sample of schools and outcome data described below.
           As a means to assess the extent of public awareness of Title IX investigations, we
compile data on topical search queries from Google Trends. Necessarily, if Title IX
investigations have any effect on prospective or current students, knowledge about the
investigations must extend beyond those directly involved. Google Trends provides a ready
means to assess volume of search activity over time. We compiled these data by searching for
the term “rape” and variations of the school’s name for the schools that had a Title IX

6
    See http://projects.chronicle.com/titleix/.


                                                     8
investigation opened between January of 2010 and July of 2017. 7 For example, we searched for
“Frostburg State University,” as well as “Frostburg” and “Frostburg State,” and “Pennsylvania
State University” as well as “Penn State.” For each university for which the OCR announced a
Title IX investigation, we generated a time series of monthly search volume, from January 2004
to June 2017.
        To consider the effects of Title IX investigations on students, we use data from the U.S.
Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). IPEDS
includes institutional characteristics and outcome data gathered from annual surveys of colleges
and universities that participate in federal student financial aid programs. We restrict our
attention to 4 year and beyond non-profit universities with non-specialized Carnegie
Classifications. 8 We also drop schools that are predominantly male or female, military schools
and schools that experience more than a 25 percent change in enrollment from one year to the
next. Finally, we limit our focus to universities that report female enrollment—a primary
outcome of interest—in each year of our sample. The resulting sample includes 1,170 institutions
reporting undergraduate female enrollment from 2002-2016 and slightly fewer schools reporting
outcomes by age, new enrollees, and returning students. Of the 1,170 institutions, 80 experienced
a Title IX investigation by OCR.
        IPEDS data allow us to consider effects of Title IX investigations on undergraduate
applications, admissions, and completions. We consider enrollment outcomes separately by
gender, age, and status as a new or returning student. We initially focus on female enrollment
outcomes, based on priors that their decisions may be more responsive to the issues surrounding
these investigations.
        We also use data from the Council for Aid to Education’s (CAE) annual Voluntary
Support of Education Survey (VSE) to consider effects of OCR Title IX investigations on alumni
giving. These data are the primary source of data on philanthropic giving to U.S. colleges and
universities and include voluntary giving from all colleges and universities willing to participate
in the survey. As before, our sample includes investigations that were opened between January of

7
  Of the 94 schools under Title IX investigation for which we searched Google Trends, we found no search activity
on the topic for eight small colleges: Cedarville College, Glenville State College, Hobart William Smith College,
Kentucky Wesleyan, Northern New Mexico College, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, St. Thomas Aquinas College,
and Samuel Merritt College.
8
  Consequently, we omit specialized schools, such as seminaries, yeshivas, schools of medicine or health
professions, and art schools.


                                                        9
2010 and July of 2014, and VSE data from 2002-2016. We use the same sample restrictions as
our IPEDS sample, though there are far fewer institutions represented in the VSE sample. In
total, our VSE sample includes 790 institutions, 65 of which experienced a Title IX
investigation.
        In Table 1 we present mean outcomes for the colleges and universities in our sample,
overall and by whether a school had an OCR Title IX investigation during our sample period.
Schools that come under federal investigation are, on average, much larger, more selective and
have higher graduation rates. The average female undergraduate full-time enrollment was 5,080
at schools with federal investigations, compared to 2,448 for schools without investigations.
Schools with investigations admit less than half of applicants, compared to 61 percent for other
schools. 9 Note, too, that BA completion rates are markedly higher for both men and women at
schools that had OCR Title IX investigations. Finally, schools that were investigated had higher
alumni giving rates than other schools (17 percent versus 13 percent) despite similar solicitation
rates (85 percent versus 83 percent). All of these comparisons highlight the importance of
controlling for systematic differences across schools in our analysis of the effects of Title IX
investigations, which we discuss in the next section.


                                            III. Empirical Models
        To measure impacts of Title IX investigations, we generate indicators of whether a
college or university had an investigation open in an academic year. We assign an investigation
to an academic year if OCR notified the institution by July of that year. As such, we would
classify a notice issued in June 2011 as occurring in the 2011-12 academic year. We recognize
that an indicator variable of a case opened in an academic year is a crude way of estimating
enrollment effects: it might take time for matriculating or prospective students to react or current
students to transfer if an OCR Title IX investigation was a source of concern. Or, it could be that
potentially mishandled cases of sexual violence that are brought to the U.S. Department of
Education are sources of upset at the university-level before any Title IX investigation is
launched. To capture these possibilities, we estimate models with both leading and lagging
indicators of Title IX investigations.


9
 Relative SAT scores are another measure of selectivity. The 75th percentile of students’ SAT scores at Title IX
schools is a full standard deviation higher than other schools.


                                                        10
        Specifically, we estimate the impact of Title IX investigations on applications,
enrollment, degree completion and alumni giving using models of the following type:


                                                           2

                      𝑦𝑦𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + � 𝛿𝛿𝑏𝑏 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡+𝑏𝑏 + 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡           (1)
                                                        𝑏𝑏=−2



where 𝑦𝑦𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is an outcome variable associated with school s in year t; 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 and 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡 are school-
specific fixed effects and linear trends, respectively; 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 are year fixed effects; and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡+𝑏𝑏 is
a set of variables indicating leads and lags relative to the opening of an investigation. We include
two leads to examine the evolution of outcomes leading up to an investigation and two lags to
examine how the effects might vary over time. The omitted category is being three or more years
prior to an investigation. Observations three or more years after an investigation is opened are
not included in the analysis because there are too few such observations to reliably estimate the
effects at longer lags since the beginning of an investigation. Thus, the coefficients of interest,
𝛿𝛿𝑏𝑏 , measure how schools’ outcomes change in the years before and after the opening of an
investigation relative what is expected based on their pre-existing trend and relative to the
changes from trend observed nationwide over the same time period. Where possible, we
separately evaluate females and males. All standard errors are clustered at the school level.


                                                        IV. Results
                           A. Examining the Salience of Title IX Investigations
        Before presenting our main results, in this section we attempt to gain insight into the
question of whether the Title IX investigations generate attention from individuals interested in a
college. We do so using monthly panel data from Google Trends on searches for “rape” or
“sexual assault” and the name of a college or university that came under Title IX investigation
during the period we study. Google Trends provides data on search interest for a term on scale of
0 to 100. The scale is normalized to the time period considered, so that 100 represents peak
search activity for a given term compared to other searches at that time. We evaluate indices for
both web searches and news searches.
        The results of this analysis are shown in an event-study graph in Figure 1, which plots
such search activity as a function of the number of months before and after the opening of a Title


                                                               11
IX investigation, adjusted for school-specific fixed effects and linear trends in addition to year-
by-month fixed effects. Month 0 refers to the month when OCR opened an investigation of a
given college or university. If the estimates were consistently at zero, it would indicate that there
were no systematic deviations from school-specific trends in searches for “rape” combined with
the school name around the time an investigation was opened. Both the estimates for web
searches (Panel A) and for news searches (Panel B) provide some evidence that search activity
starts to deviate (upwards) from trend in advance of the opening of an investigation; however,
the estimates are never statistically significant at conventional levels. Both panels show clear
evidence that search activity is significantly elevated above trend in the month an investigation is
open, and perhaps also the month before. Search activity then quickly returns to trend after the
opening of the investigation.


                                                 B. Main Results
         In Table 2, we present estimates of the impacts of Title IX investigations on a variety of
enrollment outcomes for undergraduate female students. These are the natural log of total full-
time female enrollment; first-year full-time (FYFT) enrollment; continuing and transfer
enrollment; and then full-time enrollment by age. The top and bottom panels differ in how we
model underlying time trends, and highlight the importance of controlling flexibly for institution-
specific trends. In the top panel where we do not allow for any such trends, the estimates suggest
some significant negative impacts of investigations before they are actually opened by OCR.
While it’s possible that events leading up to investigations could affect enrollment, in this case
these statistically significant estimates are entirely an artifact of different underlying trends for
schools that were the subject of Title IX investigations. As we show in the lower panel, once we
augment the specification to include institution-specific linear trends, these effects disappear. 10
All of the results discussed throughout the remainder of this paper are based on specifications
including such trends.
         The results in the lower panel of Table 2 indicate female enrollment is increased by Title
IX investigations. In particular, they indicate that female enrollment is increased by 2.4 percent
one year after enrollment could plausibly be affected (significant at the ten percent level) and 3.2

10
  The main results here differ from those of an early paper on this topic (Marcotte and Palmer, 2016) in part because
the empirical models in that paper did not include institution-specific trends. In the current paper we also use data
from a longer panel, and have dropped observations with unusually large intertemporal changes in enrollment.


                                                         12
percent two years after enrollment could plausibly be affected (significant at the five percent
level). These effects are driven by impacts on female first-time-first-year (FYFT) enrollment,
where the estimated effects are larger in magnitude (Column 2). Specifically, our estimates
indicate that female FYFT enrollment is increased by 3.6 percent one year after enrollment could
plausibly be affected (significant at the ten percent level) and 4.7 percent two years after
enrollment could plausibly be affected (significant at the five percent level). The estimated
effects on female continuing enrollment are generally close to zero (Column 3). The estimated
effects on enrollment by females transferring in are imprecise (Column 4).
        In Table 3, we present the results of our analysis of the effects on undergraduate male
enrollment. These results indicate that male enrollment is also increased by OCR Title IX
investigations, again driven by FTFY students. Moreover, they suggest that the effects are larger
and more immediate for males than females. Specifically, our estimates indicate that male FYFT
enrollment is increased by 4.2 percent in the first-year enrollment could plausibly be affected,
5.6 percent the following year, and 7.4 percent the following year. All of these estimates are
significant at the five percent level.
        As another way of investigating the effects of OCR Title IX investigations on students’
interest in schools, we also estimate the impacts on applications. The results of this analysis,
shown in Table 4 indicate that Title IX investigations lead to significant increases in applications
in the first year in which they could plausibly be affected by the opening of an investigation and
that these effects grow over time. Specifically, our estimates indicate that female applications are
increased by 7.2 percent in the first year, 9.4 percent the following year, and 13.8 percent the
following year. Our estimates indicate that male applications are increased by 8.7 percent in the
first year, 11.2 percent the following year, and 15.1 percent the following year. All of these
estimates are significant at the five percent level.
        In Appendix Table A1 we round out the picture regarding FTFY students by showing the
estimated effects on admissions. The estimated effects are always positive, suggesting that the
increases in applications are accompanied by increases in admissions, but these estimates are
never statistically significant.
        We now turn to degree completion, which we view as a rough measure of student
persistence. One might expect the circumstances surrounding a high profile OCR Title IX
investigation to disrupt students’ academic progress. This might occur if it raises students’ fear



                                                  13
for their safety or if it affects student trust of the administration. Or a student may focus less on
academic work and more on campus climate issues, or redress for victims of sexual assault.
Necessarily, though, completion and graduation rates are lagging indicators of student progress.
In Table 5 we present the estimated effects on degrees awarded and completion rates separately
for females and males. These estimates are never statistically significant at the five percent level.
       Finally, in Table 6 we show the estimated effects on alumni giving using data from the
Council for Aid to Education’s Voluntary Support of Education Survey (VSES), which is the
most comprehensive data set available on such giving. Specifically, in this table we report the
estimated effects on the percent of alumni giving and the percent solicited. These estimates
indicate that OCR Title IX investigations cause schools to intensify their efforts to solicit
donations from alumni in the years just after such an investigation is opened. In particular, they
indicate that the federal investigation causes schools to increase the number solicited by five
percentage points in the two years following the opening of an investigation. The estimated
effects on the percent of alumni giving are not statistically significant and are close to zero. If we
assume that additional efforts to solicit donations from alumni are effective, these results on
solicitations and donations jointly imply that schools are able to fully make up an expected net
reduction in donors by soliciting more alumni. To summarize, we find little evidence that the
attention brought on by an OCR Title IX investigation affects alumni giving, though this may be
in part because schools increase solicitations in response to such investigations.
       We have also investigated the impacts on the log of dollars given to capital and current
operations, in addition to the log of average donations. Unfortunately, the estimates are far too
imprecise to be able to rule out large negative or large positive effects. Likewise, we find very
imprecise estimates when we focus on giving to athletics operations. For the interested reader,
these estimates are reported in Appendix Table A2.


                        V. Discussion and Investigation of Mechanisms
       The results of our analyses naturally raise questions about the why OCR Title IX
investigations lead to increased interest from prospective students. Although we cannot answer
this question definitively, in this section we highlight what can be gleaned from the pattern of
estimates we presented previously and from interviews we conducted.




                                                 14
                                  A. Insights from the Pattern of Estimates
         Because the impacts on applications are immediate, it is unlikely that they are driven by
major positive changes at the schools under investigation—it would likely take time to
implement such changes and for prospective students to learn about them. And because these
immediate effects on applications are present for both males and females, it is unlikely that they
are driven by impacts on perceptions about school safety, which we would expect to be more
important for female prospective students than male prospective students. It seems more likely
that the effects are driven by salience. In particular, the attention generated by an OCR Title IX
investigation—though negative—may cause the school to enter the consideration sets of more
students when they are choosing where to apply. And this may naturally lead to increases in
enrollment. Interestingly, we find that the immediate positive effect on applications translates
into an immediate positive effect on first time first year enrollment for males, but not for
females. This is consistent with the idea of a recall heuristic, or “availability” heuristic (Tversky
and Kahneman, 1974), which biases females’ decisions about where to apply but not where to
attend in the short run.


                                          B. Insights from Interviews
         We also conducted interviews with admissions officers (e.g., Director of Admissions,
Dean of Admissions, VP for Enrollment Management, etc.) in order to gain further insight into
the mechanisms underlying our main results. Specifically, we sent emails to such officers at all
37 of the schools who had a Title IX investigation opened prior to 2013, which are the schools
that contribute to the estimated effects for all leads and lags. 11 This email requesting an interview
explained that we were “researching what, if any, impact a Title IX investigation may have on
applications or enrollment” and that the conversation would be confidential. If our initial contact
suggested we contact another individual at the school, we did so. In addition, we sent a second
email to individuals who did not respond to the initial email. In total, we were able to conduct
five interviews as a result of these efforts. All five of these admissions officers reported that Title
IX investigations raised no concerns about negative impacts on applications to their school. One
stated that this was because he thought it was clear that the university had not done anything

11
  Schools with investigations opened later contribute to the estimated effects as well, but only schools with
investigations opened prior to 2013 contribute to the estimated effects “t+2” or the third year following the opening
of an investigation.


                                                         15
wrong. Another explained that his school was getting more and more applications each year. A
third reported that students perceive sexual assault to be common on college campuses, so she
did not believe the attention to her school signaled any unique risk to prospective students. Given
these views, it is thus not surprising that the same admissions officers reported that little extra
was done to try to increase admissions after the Title IX investigations were opened. One
admissions officer noted that their school made a public response to being under investigation
through typical media channels. Another mentioned reminding everyone of resources available
on campus about security and safety education initiatives. As a whole, this limited set of
interviews supports the idea that a salience mechanism explains why Title IX investigations
increase interest from prospective students, rather than schools ramping up their efforts to
recruitment efforts.


                                         VI. Conclusion
       At a time of heightened attention to issues of sexual assault and harassment, there is real
debate about the role of federal policy in overseeing how U.S. colleges and universities protect
their students. The expansion (and recent contraction) of the investigatory role of the OCR has
been the most important recent change in federal policy in this domain. We study the impacts of
the OCR’s Title IX investigations on a variety of measures important to college administrators
and education researchers.
       We find no evidence that federal Title IX investigations negatively affect students’
interest in a school. Indeed, we find that they increase applications for admission from both
males and females. Moreover, they increase freshman enrollment for both males and females,
though this increase is immediate for males and only shows up one to two years later for females.
This pattern of results is consistent with the idea that salience effects generated by Title IX
investigations dominate the effects of the negative publicity associated with the investigations.
An important implication of our results is that federal investigations and campus reviews of how
sexual assault allegations are handled do not affect university applications and enrollments. We
can neither offer assessment of the procedural improvements these reviews might elicit, nor any
recourse they provide to petitioners. However, our findings should reassure college
administrators that efforts to improve processes for reviewing accusations of sexual assault and
providing remedy to victims does not come at the expense of broader university goals. Indeed



                                                16
colleges could do better to inform students about their rights under federal law, the remedies
available to them and to make their processes more transparent (Richards, 2016). A recent study
of students at 27 universities found that 63% of students thought it was likely that a sexual
assault report would be taken seriously by campus officials; only 49% of students thought that
campus officials would conduct a fair investigation if sexual assault were reported; and only 44%
of students thought that an investigation would result in any action against the offender (Cantor,
et al., 2015).

Notes: “Title IX year” refers to the first year outcomes are measured following the opening of a Title IX
investigation. Data on voluntary giving are from the Council for Aid to Education’s annual Voluntary Support
of Education Survey, 2002–2016. Information on the timing of the Title IX investigations are based on the
Chronicle of Higher Education’s Title IX Tracker database. School-year observations more than two years
following the opening of an investigation are not used in the analysis. Standard errors, clustered on schools,
are shown in parentheses.
*, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the ten, five, and one percent levels, respectively.
