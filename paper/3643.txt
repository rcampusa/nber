       MEASURING RISK AVERSION FROM EXCESS RETURNS ON A STOCK INDEX


                                  ABSTRACT


       We distinguish the measure of risk aversion from the slope

coefficient in the linear relationship between the mean excess
return on a stock index and its variance.      Even when risk

aversion is constant, the latter can vanj significantly with the

relative share of stocks in the risky wealth portfolio, and with

the beta of unobserved wealth on stocks.

       We introduce a statistical model with ARCH disturbances and

a time-varying parameter in the mean (TVP ARCH-N).       The model

decomposes the predictable component in stock returns into two

parts: the time-varying price of volatility and the time-varying

volatility of returns.      The relative share of stocks and    the   beta

of   the   excluded components of wealth on stocks are instrumented

by   macroeconomic   variables.   The ratio of corporate profit over

national income and the inflation rate ore found to be important

forces in the dynamics of stock price volatility.

MEASURING     RISK AVERSION     FROM    EXCESS RETURNS     ON   A   STOCK   INDEX



I.    Introduction

     The trade—off between risk and return is central to the theory of

finance.    The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM(    of Sharpe (1964),

Lintner (1965) , and Mossin    (1966) was first to provide a comprehensive

framework   for detennining asset prices with the theme that only

systematic risk is rewarded by the market.       The risk premium on the

market portfolio was linked to investor risk aversion by Totin (1958)

and Pratt (1964)


     Morton (1969, 1973) shows that a lifetime consumption—investment

model yields risk premia of the same form as the single period model

when the investment opportunity set is constant and portfolios are

continuously rebalanoed.      This result will still hold when the variance

of the market portfolio varies randomly and cannot be hedged.


     Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1953) and Pindyck (1985) assume a single

factor CAPM, and use a 'reasonable" parameter for relative risk aversion

(between 3 and 4), as defined in Pratt       (1964), in an attempt to infer

risk premiums from estimated variances.        Inferring   in the opposite

direction Friend and Blume     (1975)   attempt to estimate the coefficient of

relative risk aversion of a representative investor using estimates of

relative portfolio shares of financial assets, and the ax-post excess

return average and variance of these assets.        While tney pot the

estimate of relative risk aversion at about 2, their method uses the

unconditional variance,    which is not consistent with the model
                                                                                         I

assumption      of portfolio    rebalancing.     There, the risk premium ougho to

be determined by the conditional or expected vsrience.


      GARCH-M models of stock returns           (see Bollerslev,    Chou,   and Kroner

(5CR,    1990)) for an extensive review and references             of ARCH modeling in

finance)      jointly estimate the time varying conditional variance and a

constant mean-variance         ratio that represents the risk—return trade—off.

5CR document the extensive use of these models (with multivariate

extensions)      in empirical work in financial economics.


         A   numier of studies question the existence of a          positive
mean/variance      ratio, directly challenging the mean—variance paradigm.
In   Glosten,    Jagannathan   and Runkle (1900), when     they explicitly include
the   nominal risk—free     rate in the conditioning      information set, obtain a

negative ARCH—H parameter.          While Harvey (1989) finds the ratio of

expected return to stock index volatility non—constant and counter

cyclical, Backus and Gregory (1988)            argue that the relationship between

the conditional mean and the conditional variance is non—linear.                  Abel

(1988) claims that in a general equilibrium the mean/variance

relationship     is not necessarily positive when the investor's preference

is not logarithmic.



         At the same time, there is some evidence that the static CASH

performs empirically better than the intertemporal consumption—based

model.       (See among others Mankiw and Shapiro       (1936)   and Attanesic

(1989))       Moreover,   the static CASH may be attracting some new interest.

As Grossman and Larocue         (1987)   show, explicit consideration of

transaction costs in consumption technology would make the static CASH
relevant even in an intertemporal    context.     Others to make a case for

the validity of the static CAPM are Epstein and Zin (1989), who derive

an lntertemporal   non-expected utility model.


    In a model economy where a representative       agent maximizes a time—

additive von Neumann—Morgenaternutility, the mean/variance ratio can

still change as a result of any combination of: changing preferences

toward risk, or changing investment opportunities.        Only absent of any

suon change, with constant relative risk aversion, will the CAPM deliver

a constant mean/variance ratio for the market portfolio and its

components  -




    we begin by systematically examining        the temporal instability of

the mean/variance ratio, first by rolling regressions       and then in a more

sphistioated manner by introducing a time-varying parameter        (TVP)   into

the ARCH—M model.    Finally,   we seek to identify empirical macroeconomic

proxies   for the unobserved components of wealth.      (Related work om the

sensitivity of the CAPM with respect to changes in the market portfolio

is found in Stambaugh (1982)



     Section II applies the ARCH-h model to the CAPH with two risky

assets, and provides further evidence of the time-varying pattern of the

mean/variance ratio.     A time—varying parameter model is then presented

in Section III.     In Section Iv we examine the relation between the

estimated time—varying parameter and some particular economic variables.

The final section presents conclusions and suggestions for future

research.

II.     Estimating Risk Aversion             in the CAPH   Framework    with   the

ARCH-M Model

11.1      The cAPM   and the Market    Portfolio

        Consider   an exchange econony where there are three        asset classes:
one     risk—free asset, and two risky asset classes.           The risky assets

consist of a stock portfolio, whose returns are observed, and an
unobserved portfolio of the renaming risky assets. The excess returns
(over the risk—free rate) on the two risky assets are, respectively, r1
ant rN witn variances C2 and            2
                                       Ok)



            joint normal distribution of the excess returns, the CAPM
        With a

predicts that all investors will hold the market portfolio, the value
weighted portfolio of all risky assets. Individuals hold only
combinations      of the riskless asset and the market portfolio in relative

proportions      determined by individual      risk aversion.
        In equilibrium, the      expected excess return of the market portfolio,
       will be related to the means of the asset class portfolios by
E)rW).

where w is the weight of the stock index portfolio in the market, and

(l—w)    is the proportion of the unobserved class in the value of the

market portfolio.        The parameter w can also be interpreted as the

relative demand for stocks.           (l—w) is the sum of the weights of all

unobserved risky assets and rN is the value weighted average of their

excess returns.
                                                                                   5




    The CAPM predicts that each risky asset will be priced to earn a

risk premium   that   is given by,



                        &ov(r.,rM                                     (11.2)


where    is the harmonic mean of individual relative risk aversion,            which

may be changing over time, because of a structural change in preferences

or with the distribution of wealth.    Equation 11.2 has to hold also for
any portfolio, and so r, may be replaced   with r1 and r.

    (11.1) and (11.2) imply that, for stocks,


                                (1 —
                                       w)a3                           (11.3)

where                      Equation
                                  11.3      indicates   that the expected stock—
        SMOv(rStN).
index return is proportional to the weighted average of its variance and

covariance with the unobserved portfolio.         That is, the stock—index risk

premium depends not only on its own volatility but also on its

covariances   with returns of other risky assets. Thus, the relative
shares of the asset classes and uncertainty about the unobserved risky
portfolio will affect the stock index.

    Most   empirical   studies of the intertemporal      CAPM use broad stock

indexes to proxy the market portfolio,        e.g., Fama and MacSeth (1973),

Black, Jensen, and Scholes     (1972) .   This   approach would be justified by

either of two assumptions:     wl,     that is, stocks are the only relevant

risky assets, or that the unobserved assets covariance with stocks is

equal to the stock variance,     that is,               In each case (11.3)

reduces to
                                                                                       6



                                                                      (11.4)



None of these assumptions is supported by evidence,             however,   and findings

demonstrate that          (11.4)    is not adequate to explain movements in stock—

index returns.




11.2    The ARcH-M Model and Some Empirical Anomalies

       The ARCN-M model proposed by           Engle, Lilien, and Robins (1987)

consists of the system:


                y     =   ch    + e                                   (11.5)

                      =         +
                lit        a0       a1e1      a2h1                           (11.6)


where et is the prediction error assumed to be Gaussian and serially

uncorrelated with mean zero and conditional variance ht.              More

specifically,    ht is the conditional variance of the variable yt given

all information up to time t—1.              This model characterizes the evolution

of the mean and variance of a time series simultaneously.


       The process specifying the conditional variance, equation 11.6, is

a GARtH (1,1) process.              It implies that the conditional variance is

driven by three factors: the autonomous component,             the surprise,   and

last period's variance.             Thus,   (11.5) and (11.6) are really GARCN)l,l)—

N,   Richer dynamic patterns of variances can be modeled by introducing

higher—order terms of past prediction errors or conditional variances,

but empirical    studies frequently suggest that GARtH (1,1) is edequate.'

1
  French, Schwert, and Staaugh (1987), use a GARtH (2,1) in (11.6)
with an intercept in the mean equation (11.5), but these variations do
not makc much difference.  For detailed specification and estimation of
the GARON and ARCN—M models, see Bollerslev (1986) and Engle, Lilien,
and Robins (1987) . The CAFM does not support the inclusion of an
                                                                              7




       The ARCH-K model (11.5) and (11.6) can be used to estimate the CAPM

(11.4) if the stock index is the market portfolio,      and its volatility

follows the GARCH process.     The model will fail, however, if the

estimate of relative risk aversion (the mean/variance ratio), c in

(11.5), or if the GARCH parameters,     a in (11.6), vary over time.


       French, Schwert and Stambaugh   (1987), or FSS, estimates of the risk

aversion parameter   are very unstable across sample periods      For the

entire sample period 1928—1984 they obtain a value of      1693   using the

NYSE monthly value—weighted index.      Estimates for 1928-1952 and 1953—

1984 sub—periods   are 1.510 and 7.220, respectively.     Kith the Standard &

Poor's daily composite index, the two sub—sample estimates are 0.598 and

7.809, even further apart.     Estimates   obtained in Chou (1988) seem to be

more stabler 4.50,   5.05,   and 6.15 for the periods 1962—1985, 1962—1973,

and 1974-1985, respectively,     using the weekly NYSE value—weighted index.

Differences   in the two studies' estimates could be attributable to the

latter shorter sample period.

       We use rolling samples to examine the temporal behavior of the

ARCH-K coefficients.    To obtain precise estimates, we need data that are

more frequent than monthly. Because daily NYSE stock index data are not

available until July 1962, we use the Standard & Poor's Composite Index

as a proxy for the market portfolio;       it is available daily from January

1928 through December 1987.2

    We prefer weekly over daily returns to avoid documented anomalies

of day—of—the—weekeffects, e.g., Hem      (1986)   .   Weekly excess   returns

are obtained by differencing the logs ef weekly Tuesday closing prices.

The risk—free   rate used to construct the weekly excess returns is the

short—term interest rate from the Ibbotson and Sinquefield database.

ARCH—N coefficients were estimated for every quarter from 1933 through

1987.   For each quarter estimate, the sample contains five previous

years of weekly data, amounting to approximately        260 observations.    The

rolling estimation procedure yields a muarterly time series of the

coefficient   c in (11.5), with 221 quarterly   observations.


    The graph of this series in Figure 1 is strongly time—varying.           The

coefficient   ranges from —0.4 to 15.6, with a mean of 5.4 and standard

deviation   of 4.1.   Both the dynamic pattern and the magnitude of the

coefficient   are similar to the results in Friend and Blume (1975) who

report mean/variance ratios of 0.925, 8.673, 14.165, and 1.372 for the

respective four decades between 1932 and 1971.         That is, the ARCH-N

model, which uses the conditional distribution,        confirms the instability

of the mean/variance ratio.     The erratic behavior of this coefficient

indicates   the inadequacy of the ARCH—N model to fit the stock return

data.



    Another empirical anomaly reported by FOS is that the ARCH-N model

seems to predict risk pcemiums which are too high, with the average

predicted excess return almost twice the average realized excess
returns.3       It is hard to accept a model that performs so badly in this

respect.


       To sum up, although the ARCH-H model is a useful tool in modeling

the stock index return, adjustments      to the model seem necessary. The

instability of the estimated value for risk aversion end the

inconsistent behavior of excess returns that the ARCH—H model predict

are important      empirical anomalies that should be resolved.


       The estimated parameters from the rolling sample estimation

indicates    that a time—varying approach may be appropriate.          The rolling

sample estimated series is only an approximation because it uses

relatively short sample periods (five years is arbitrary),            and it is

unlikely that quarter to quarter changes of the ooeffioient would be so

large.     Further,   it is inconsistent to estimate a time—varying

parameter, while at the same time assuoting it to be constant within

five—year sample periods.


       The next section introduces an ARCH-H model with a time-varying

mean/variance ratio, which allows formal estimation and explanation of

the variation of this parameter.

      There are three sets of unknowns to be estimated:          b        the states;
                                                                     t,

h, the variances of e;          and   a, 2'   a3,
                                                     and Q, the fixed parameters.

The estimation of these unknowns is carried out simultaneously by a

Kalman filter and maximum likelihood.          Estimates of the states ace

produced by the Kalmsn filter conditional on the parameter values.

Given values of the parameters,        the variance of the measurement errors

can be obtained through the BARON equation.            After each pass of the

Kalmsn filter and the BARON equation,         the value of the likelihood can be

computed, and nonlinear routines can then be used to maximire the

likelihood.     These steps are repeated until ccnvergence is reached.4


      At each point in time, the contemporaneous variance of                  (denoted

N)    is obtained from the valuea of the parameters.          The log likelihood

function     for this model can be written in terms of the innovations (see
Schweppe (1965)),     as



                  =                              .                               (111.5)

  The Kslman filter  is widely used in systems engineering,   It has been
applied also to economic models with time—varying coefficients and
unobservable components.   Basically it is a recursive algorithm that
produces optimal estimates of the state variable.   It is optimal in the
aense that it produces the minimum mean square error estimates of the
states, conditional on the newly available information.   Anderson and
Moore (1971) give a comprehensive exposition of Kalman filter methods,
and Engle and Watson (1985) provide a survey of applications of the
Kaimsn filter in economics.

derivatives     are used to compute the gradient using the IMSL sub—routine

"EOONF."

     Initial values are required for both state and variance variables,

           as well as for the parameters a. and 0.               Values from estimating
b0, h0,

a Ft (fixed—parameter) ARCN—M are natural candidates for the ai's and

ho, and indeed turn out to be cuite efficient in approaching the final

estimated values.      A diffuse prior distribution is assumed for the
initial value of the state,           we assign a large value (1000) to
                            b0, i.e.,

its variance.




111.2 Results

     The data used for estimation are the monthly excess returns (in

percents)   of the NYSE value—weighted index for 1926—1985.               There are 720

observations.      The Ft ARCH—M model estimates            (with t—ststistics in

brackets)   are:

     These parameter estimates are used for initial values in estimating

the TVP ARCH-N model.      The final converged values for the parameters in

the variance equation,                  and        are, respectively,   0.989,   0.127,

and 0.836, very close to the estimates in the fixed—parameter model.

The estimated value of Q is 0.032, much smaller than that of h                   (average

of 31.995).     The average vslue of                             to a standard deviation

The fact that the parameters in the variance equation are so close to

that of the F? ARCH—N model implies that the estimates of ht in the two

models will also oe close.


    Figure 2 plots the variance estimates from the two models.               They

seem to be indistinguishable. Note that the expected risk premium

predicted by the model is       Although the conditional variances from

       Inuoed, the data suggesc that bt varoes significantly over time.

nitialiration of the state variable.             At each point in time, only past

i:.forrutocn (which includes the large variance set for the initial

state; is incorporated in estimating the state variable.              Tmprecise

estimates are obtained during earlier periods of the sample, because

little information from the data is used, leaving only che effect of the

diffuse prior.         This phenomenon explains the initial broad confidence

       Except for      the earlier periods, b is mostly significantly

some periods the significance levels are greater than 5%, but except for

      It's interesting to comoare this             series with the rolling sample

result (see Figure 4)     .   The general   patterns   of these   two series are

ouita similar.       They are low in the thirties and gradually increase

during the forties.       They remain high during the fifties and sixties,

then drop hack to a lower level after the oil shocks and recession uf

the mid—seventies.       The correlation coefficient      of these two series for

their overlapping     sample perioda (quarterly 1933—1985)        is 0.87.   The TVP

series is notably smoother than the rolling sample estimates, which

suggests that the extreme fluctuat ma of the rolling sample estimates

may be partly due to sampling errors.5



    As we noted earlier, although the volatility series from the F?

ARCH—N end the TV? ARCH-N models are indistinguishable,            the implied

equity prer.iuma or the expected excess returns can be quite different,

as is evident    from variations in the price of volatility.          Comparison of

these two series provides an opportunity to resolve the "puzzle"

reported by FOS that the ARCH—N model gives an average risk premium that

is twice as high as the average realized excess return.

    Table 1 shows that the average risk premium for the TV? ARCH—N

model is .54 or .60, depending on the treatment of negative values,



5Some fluctuation in the rolling sample estimates may be attributable
to shifts in parameters in the variance equation that the time—varying
parameter model, which assumes constancy for all these parameters,
cannot capture.

equity premiums    (predicted excess returns) from both models,            During

highly   volatile periuds, the fixed-parameter         model seems   to overestimate
the level of risk premiums. For less erratic periods, rhe difference
between these two     series is not obvious,

      To compare the predictive powers of the two methods, we regress the

realired excess   return on each of the predicted premiums. Regressions
with both predicted premiums as explanatory variables           are also
eotimated.    Table presents the regression results for the full sample

Whotes consistent, standard errors are given. The R2 of the regression
wion a regressor from      the TV?   ARCR—M   modet   is significantly higher   than
the regression using      F?   in all samples. When both regressors are
                               ARCH—M


incicued in the reg:ession, the premium predicted by the TV? ARCHM
model has a higher t-value than that predicted by the fixed parameter

model in all samples.

    We use four different proxies for              The first two proxies are

the broadest in that they refer to all U.S. assets;        real (including

numan capital),    and financial.    The flow of income from ownership of

stocks is approximately measured by corporate profits while the income

from all wealth is simply national income.         If each is 1(1), and each is

discounted at the same rate, their ratio will approximately equal the

ratio of the value of stocks to total wealth.         Hence the share of

corporate profit in national,             income is a possible proxy for w.
                                    w1,


    The second proxy, w2, is the ratio of the value of all NYSE stocks

to gross consumption.       The single—factor OAPN with a constant

cpportunity   set (which is equivalent to the consumption beta model)

equities in total wealth.       Both consumption figures and the value of

NYSE stocks are available monthly from 1959 to 1985; quarterly

observations are iveilable from 1946 to 1985.


     Two more proxies      for w correspond to narrower definitions of

wealth.     For         total wealth is am estimate of physical wealth which
                  w3,


includes all financial and tangible assets for the total U.S. economy,
while for    only financial assets are included. Total equity value is

are availaole,

6 As of Oeoember 1985, the total value of stocks listed on the NYSE was
about 79% of the value of all U.S. corporate equity.
       The total wealth portfolio is dominated by human capital and real

eatate.     There is little doubt that the beta of real estate on storks is

less than one, indeed, it may very well be negative (See Ibbotson and

Brinson    (1987, pp.35—43))        .     The beca of human capital on storks is also

must likely small.            While business ryrles affect labor income and

corporate profits similarly, they affect highly skilled labor less than
unskilled labor. Indeed, investment in human capital may very well be
counter cyclical. While it is impossible to compute     directly, time-     3,.



varying elements of i may be captured                    nevertheless      by eccncrdr

variables,         We use the rate of inflation and the reel interest rate.                     It

is plausible        that: the    sensotlvicy of wealth—asset prices to the prices

of stocks differ In period of different                   levels of inflacion and real

       The third source of variaticns in b                  comes from
                                                                           '      the   risk

eversion parameter.             For a broad class of stylized utility functions,

e.g., tIARA, relative           risk aversion will depend on the level of wealth,

and ccnseouently may be correlated with changes in the level of

consumption.         There    is neither evidence         mcr   stylized fact      on whether

relative risk aversion is increasing, decreasing, cc constant in wealth,

IV.2    Correlacioo      of bt     with   Eccncmic Variables

       Table   3   presents     regressions         of b_ cmi   h,,   on the four proxies for

the stock—portfolio           weight, the two economic variables that are expected

to be correlated with the beta of onobsereed wealth on stocks (the real
                                                                                      19




    rate of interest and the rate of inflation),          and the instrument for risk

    aversion (real per-capl.ta consumption)     .    We   report results for the value

    ieighted series only, since     they   are almost identical      to the equally

    weighted series.     All the variables in Table 3 are estimated to be 1(1),

    and hence differenced.      These estimates are approximations for the

    variables    in equation   (IV.2) and are estimated with quarterly data.


        The economic variables, particularly the proxies for the relative

    portfolio    shares of stocks, are, by design, contemporaneously correlated

    with the stock returns.      As a result they will also be highly correlated
    with the estimated bt and, but not with the ht series.             To minimize the

    effect of this spurious correlation,       the second panel      of Table 3

    presents identical    regressions with lagged values of the economic

    variables.     Each panel in Table 3 presents estimates from three

    regressions    on the economic variables,       two for the price of volatility

    and one for the volarility itself.        The first regression of the price of

    volatility excludes the volatility itself, the second includes it.


         The regression results clearly support the hypothesis that the

    price of volatility can be varying due to changes in the relative value

    of stocks, and the beta of unobserved assets, even if risk aversion

    remains constant.     The next to last row of Table        3   gives the   X2

I   statistic     (with 4 degrees of freedom) for the hypothesis that the

    coefficients    of all four proxies for portfolio share of stocks are zero.

    The critical value for z.OOl is 14.85, while the test statistic is

    greater than 30 in all four regressions.
                                                                                   20



     The positive    coeffioient   of all      w's   is consistent   with (IV.2) for

bets less thsn one.     When the value of stooks rises relative to other

oomponents    of wealth, a rise    i:   the price of volatility oan be

attributable to the increased marpinal risk of storks, rather than to

higher risk aversion,       At the sane tine, the variance of the rate of

return of stooks is attually lower, as suggested by the negative

coefficients of the proxies (in         7   out of 8 oases) in the regression of

conditional variance on the economd,c variables           (and as might be

predirted by a leversge argument)


     Both proxies for the beta of unobserved assets with stocks, the

rate of inflation and the real rate of interest, have a significant

(negative)    impact on the price of volatility.          Equation Iv,2 predicts

that bets will be negatively correlated with the price of volatility.

0cc results agree if we assume that the beta of unobserved assets on

stocks is greater in periods of high inflation and real interest rates.


    Real per—capita consumption,            the proxy for the coefficient of risk
aversion,    shows a contemporaneous strong (negative) impact on
                                                                         btf and
hardly any impact:   when   lagged one q-uarter. With       constant relative risk
aversion, the result of the contemporaneous regression is attributable
to the positive correlation of changes in consumption with changes in
wealth, and hence with rates of return on stocks. The absence of
significant impact of consun.ption in the lagged eqvation is consistent
with this explanation. On the other hand, if taken at face value, the
positive coefficient of consumption in the contemporaneous regression
suggests that risk aversion is increasing with wealth. Risk aversion
may be changing for other reasons that are not proxiad hare, however.
                                                                                                 21




           The results presented in Table 3 make a case for our argument that
C
    risk   aversion may not easily be inferred from rates of return on stocks

    and   that    economic   variables affect the price of volatility.


    IV.3 Further Tests of      the Dependence of b on Economic Variables
           The   regression analysis so far has been descriptive since it uses
                                                                               We now
    as   dependent variable estimates from the entire sample.

    substitute      (17.2)   for (111.2) and recognize that the economic variables

    must interact with the volatility.                 If only a single variable is

    relevant, the model becomes



                      r5     =
                                 c,,t c2(,t1 +
                                        +                     e0
                                                                                        (17.3)
                                         2                2                              (17.4)
                             =
                                 a0   a,ts,t_l     +
                                                       a2O,t_l

    where    r is the excess return          on   stocks, and      is one of   the proxies or

    related variables of w, , and 5. This is the ARtH—M model with cross—
    product terms in the mean eruation, and can be estimated by
                                                                maximum

    likelihood.

                 data are used for formal tests on the significance of the
           Monthly
    coefficient c2 because higher freouency data provide better estimates of
    conditional      variances.       The sample covers the period 1959-1985,

    corresponding      to the availability of the consumption data. Estimation
                                                                                  and 1973—
    results       are also reported for sub sample periods 1989—1972,

    1985.        Table 4 presents the results.


                 for per capita real consumption, estimatiot. results support
            Except

     the argument that the price of volatility is affected by the economic

variables,      consistent with the regression result of Tatle                      3,       Once the
cross    product term         w2C, is        included in the model, the coefficienc of

        becomes insignificant and even assumes the wrong sign.                           The low t—

statistic      values of the coefficient of the cross—product                   term may

reflect multicollinearity.                  Estimation with only the cross-product term

yields a t-statistic of 2.82 for the full sample, with 2.8? and 1.00 for

sub sample periods.


     The role of inflation appears to be the most important. When ohe
inflation rate is used for I in the estimation, the t—valueo of izC
are always significant at the                 5%   level.

    In an attempt to estimate a structural model we assume that the
sensitivity factor,     is linearly dependent on the rate of inflation,
                              '
i.e.,          A0
                    +   A1it, and        that the stock return is driven by              a   process
with    mean given by (11.3) with a GARCN)l,1) variance specification. The

model   can then be written as

       r50 =   S[w_1
                         +
                              A0(l

                                                                      1)r11,c e +               IV.t)

       Ecuation (IV.5) can also be rewritten as

                                                                      —
                                                                          w1)r.,t + e           (17.7)

where                         and                  Note   that all explanacory economic
        C1=     C2=A03,             C3=A16,

variables are lagged once to ensure that the expected return depends

only on   predetermined variables.                  The   portfolio weight of stocks, w, is
                                                                                   23




measured by the ratio of corporate profit to national income becauoe it

is available from 1946.


       It turns out that very large standard errors are obtained for

                                  The reason is that       is very smooth compared
estimates    of   C1   and C_.

The model is also estimated assuming A3=1, i.e,              =l±Alrt implying
                       equals one wich no inflation.        Table S gives the
CrC2 andthat
results,    including estimation with         wl,   wnicn corres onds   to the usual

fixed-parameter ARCh-k model.

        the likelihood function values indicate, both models witn and
       As
without unit restriction for A3 outperform the usual ARCH—k modei. The
restricted version (Al) cannot be rejected and reduces the standard
error of the coefficient C1, which is also an estimate of the risk

aversion parametar &             In   this procedure, the point estimate of this
parameter     becomes positive for the full period and toe second sub sample

period.      The estimates of C, and C, are reasonably stable across the two


sub sample periods,        although both are less significant for the period

1966—1985.        The likelihood ratio test for model stability across sample

                                           is stable, wnile the fixed—
periods suggests that the restricted model

parameter ARCH—k model is not.


       To investigate the robustness of our model we perform some fortoer

 diagnostic tests.        We have restricted our variance specification to

 GARCH(1,1).       Sut there are no theories to exclude other economic

 variables    that may be important in driving the conditional variances as

 well as the conditional mean.             It is possible therefore that the effects
                                                                                           24




of econoric variables on the price of volatility are attributable to

this relationship      through the second moment.


     Researchers      who follow thia strategy in modeling stock variances

include Campbell and Shiller (1989), Harvey (1989), Attanasio (1989),

and Attanasio      and Wadhwani (1989) among others.       Abtanaaio and Wadhwani

(1989) ,   for   example,   find that the predictability of expected stock

returns given lagged dividend yields reported in Fama and Frenob (1988)

can be explained by a risk measure estimated by an ARCH with laooed

dividend yields.

    We hence re-estimate our final model (with the restriction
                                                               A6=l)

while allowing lagged inflation       rates and lagged portfolio weights              to

enter into the variance egustion.         A   likelihood ratio test of our

original model against this general model gives a test statistic of

8.88, which is significant       at the 5% level but not at the 1% level

This result indicates that a better forecast of the volatilities may be

obtained by including economic variables in the GARCH)l,l)                 model.


     Cur original conclusion concerning the mean effect, however, is not
much affected by thom re—estimation.          The estimates of             and C    are
                                                                  C1

7.32 (with t—value of 4.92) and —7.04         (with t—value of —3.26), which are

fairly close to the         riginsl estimates in Table 5.      Further,       the

significance      of the two economic variables           and m) added to the
                                                    (w2

variance equation is weaker according to the Wald test )t—values 1.67

and —0.75, respectively,       not significant at the 5% level)        -




     According to the       result of the restricted model for the foil sample

period, the estimate of the risk aversion parameter is 7.2, which is
                                                                             25




most likely too hIgh.   The two standard error low bound for this

parameter is 4.67, which is more in acrord with other estimates.



V.   Conclusion

      Analysis of an econometric model estimating a time—varying risk!

return relation of the stock market indicates that the TVP ARCH—M model

provides more precise estimates of the expected return of the stock

market index than the fixed—parameter    ARCH-k model.    The model takes

explicit account of the role of risky assets other then stocks in

explaining the time variation of the mean/variance       rstio for stooks.

Proxies for portfolio weights end the bets of the unobserved assets on

stocks   are found to he tmoortsnt in deterraning expected stock returns.

      Although oor oeoi noel work   is   only nreliminsry,   further studies
in this vein seem promising. More detailed investigations may explain
the role of the rate of inflation in stock prioe movements. The
relationship of our findings with the recent literstuoe on
predictability of excess stock returns may be fruitful for future
research.
