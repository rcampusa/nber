Fraud in the Workplace? Evidence from a Dependent Verification Program

JEL No. I13

                                             ABSTRACT

Many employers have implemented dependent verification (DV) programs, which aim to reduce employee
benefits costs by ensuring that ineligible persons are not enrolled in their health plan as dependents.
We evaluate a DV program using a panel of health plan enrollment data from a large, single-site employer.
We find that dependents were 2.7 percentage points less likely to be reenrolled in the year that DV
was introduced, indicating that this fraction of dependents was ineligibly enrolled prior to the program’s
introduction. We show that these dependents were actually ineligible, rather than merely discouraged
from re-enrollment by compliance costs.

                                                           In the United States, most workers who receive health insurance through an employer

also enroll one or more dependents.1 A significant fraction of employers’ healthcare expenditure

is attributable not to employees themselves, but to these dependents, who typically account for

about half of the population enrolled in employer plans (US Census Bureau [2011]). Because

employers often heavily subsidize the costs of insuring dependents, these health benefits can

create incentives for workers to try to enroll individuals who do not actually qualify as

dependents.2 Typical employer subsidies yield thousands of dollars in expected benefits that an

employee could exploit by claiming (say) a niece or a nephew as a child.3 On the other hand,

outside of their contribution to the premium, the expected cost to employees of falsely claiming a

dependent is about zero—in general, the only consequence is simply removal of the ineligible

individual from the policy. In short, strong incentives exist to claim ineligible dependents.

          Figures from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey show that in a typical employer plan, the

average insurance payout for a dependent was around $4,700 in 2010, while the average incremental

worker contribution for enrolling that dependent ranged from $0 to $1,390, depending on the plan

structure (Crimmel [2011]).
3
          For the employer that we study in this paper, we can make a more precise statement: the average

insurer payment for a dependent in 2009 was $2,780. The incremental cost of adding a dependent

ranged from $0 (if adding an additional child to a family plan) to $2028 (if moving from “employee

only” to “employee plus spouse” in the most expensive plan).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1	  

	  
        To help rein in costs and prevent abuse, in recent years many employers have

implemented dependent verification (DV) programs, which aim to ensure that ineligible persons

are not enrolled in their health plan as dependents. Typically, DV policies require employees to

present documentation proving the status of dependents, like marriage licenses for spouses and

birth certificates for children.


        While almost non-existent a decade ago, DV programs are gaining popularity in both the

public and private sectors. As one news account noted:


        "Dependent eligibility audits," in which companies demand proof that spouses and
        children qualify for medical benefits, are swiftly becoming both fashionable and
        financially rewarding for companies frantic to curb the runaway costs of health coverage.
        Companies such as Boeing General Motors and American Airlines have been asking
        workers to send in marriage licenses, birth certificates, student IDs, and tax returns. The
        goal: to cull the benefits rolls of ineligibles, which could include ex-spouses, stepchildren
        who live elsewhere, or 29-year-old college grads still being claimed as dependents. In the
        last year, the number of benefit audits "has just exploded," says Watson Wyatt human
        resources consultant Susan Johnson (Epstein and McGregor [2007]).

Of the 507 large firms surveyed in 2010 by the management consulting firm Towers Watson

[2010, p. 7], 55 percent had a dependent verification program in their health plan in 2008, 61

percent in 2009, and 69 percent in 2010.


        These programs are potentially important not only to the bottom lines of private sector

enterprises, but to the public finances as well. Health benefits make up more than 10 percent of

state and local government employee compensation (Bureau of Labor Statistics [2012]).

Weeding out ineligible dependents is often seen as an easy way to keep benefits costs lower and

to trim public sector compensation budgets. By 2012, at least 38 states had implemented




                                                  2	  

	  
dependent verification or audit policies for state employee health plans.4 When justifying the

imposition of these policies, states almost universally cited the cost burden of ineligible

dependents as the motivating factor.


                                                           All of this begs the question of whether these programs are actually effective in reducing

ineligible enrollees and the associated costs. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that they do.

According to news reports, for example, “Goodyear Tire & Rubber trimmed 13% of its 70,000

dependents, due to ineligibility, in its 2005 audit, saving 6% on costs” (Epstein and McGregor

[2007]). Similarly, “HRAdvance, a Dallas-based human-resources company, completed an audit

of a large retailer’s health plan. The audit revealed that 12.6% of the dependents didn’t meet the

plan’s eligibility requirements and their coverage was dropped, producing projected first-year

savings to the employer of $25 million net of the audit’s cost.” (Knight [2009]). More

generally, according to an industry consultant, “employers remove an average of 8% to 12% of

dependents after conducting an audit, of which 60% to 70% are children.” (Silva [2008]). Some

evidence suggests that DV programs have been quite effective in the public sector as well. In

West Virginia, auditors have reported that over 8 percent of enrolled dependents in a population

of 137,000 dependents of state workers were ineligible (Healthcare Data Management, Inc.

[2011]).


                                                                Despite these claims, we are aware of no independent econometric work documenting

either the need for or the efficacy of dependent verification.

programs in terms of reduced claims is important, because their administration is not without

cost. Employees have the bother of finding and presenting the relevant documentation: “Even

those whose dependents are eligible may have to work hard to prove it,” (Epstein and McGregor

[2007]). For employers there are explicit costs of running the program, borne either internally or

in the form of payments to external consultants, which could be $20 to $30 per worker (Epstein

and McGregor [2007]). Employers may also have to expend time and resources negotiating

dependent verification policies with their employees’ unions, especially in the public sector. As

well, some reports indicate that DV programs lead to morale problems. When Minnesota

instituted a DV program for all state employees, press reports indicated that it caused

“headaches—and a lot of anxiety.” The president of the Minnesota Association of Professional

Employees said, “What we’re upset about is that it just seems like harassment of state

employees. And there’s a presumption of guilt that’s disturbing” (Grow [2012]). Morale is not

just an issue for the employees who have to verify their dependents’ legitimacy. The Employer

whose program is studied here recounted to us that the staff members who administered the

program also were unhappy because of abuse they received from their fellow employees.


        Beyond the costs and morale problems associated with implementing verification, DV

programs could possibly discourage eligible dependents from enrolling due to the costs

associated with gathering and presenting the required documentation. Even the enrollment of

employees, themselves, could be affected by DV if such costs induce whole families to switch

over to a spouse’s employer plan.


       While there has been no independent research on dependent verification programs for

health insurance, several studies have examined the practice of falsely claiming dependents in

                                                 4	  

	  
other contexts. For example, in tax year 1987, the federal government began requiring Social

Security numbers for all dependents (five years and older) reported on individual tax returns.

Several papers have estimated the effect of this provision on the number of dependents claimed.5

Benefits under the Earned Income Tax Credit also are a function of the number of dependents;

here too, there have been attempts to eliminate false claims (See Scholz [2008] and Holtzblatt

and McCubbin [2004]). Other related literatures focus on insurance fraud in settings including

auto (Tennyson and Salsas-Forn [2001]), home (Phua, Lee, Smith, and Gayler [2010]), and

disability (Peng, et al. [2007]). Taken together, these papers show that when there is some gain

to be had by falsely claiming dependents, a substantial number of people will do so. Nonetheless,

it is not obvious that the insights from tax and insurance fraud studies translate to the employer

health insurance setting. In the case of health insurance, the population of enrollees is relatively

small and employees might have personal relationships with each other and with their employer.

They might be disinclined to commit fraud in such an environment.


                                                           In this paper, we evaluate a DV program using health plan enrollment data from a large,

single-site employer (hereafter referred to as “the Employer”) who implemented it during the

open enrollment period for 2010. Our basic strategy is to track the enrollment status of

individuals before and after the policy was implemented, including both employees and

dependents. Because by definition DV plans directly impact only dependents, the employees

serve as a natural control for year-to-year trends in enrollment, allowing identification of the

effect of DV on the enrollment of dependents.

          See for example, Szilagyi [1990], although because of data limitations, there is no econometric

analysis

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5	  

	  
       Our main findings are: 1) Relative to all other years, dependents were 2.7 percentage

points less likely to be reenrolled in the year that DV was introduced. 2) DV did not induce

employees to leave the Employer’s plan and (say) put themselves and their dependents on the

spouse’s plan. 3) The disenrollment effect was about twice as strong for children as for spouses:

2.9 percentage points for children versus 1.5 percentage points for spouses. 4) The results

differed among some subgroups of employees. The effects were especially large for dependents

of maintenance and service staff, same-sex partners, and older children. Our estimates indicate

that approximately 20 percent of children 24 and older who were enrolled in the program were

actually ineligible. Effects for lower-earning employees were larger, but only marginally

statistically different from higher-earners.


       With the basic results on disenrollment patterns in hand, we explore several important

ancillary issues. In particular, we find that: 1) Disenrollment occurred because dependents were

actually ineligible, rather than because providing the documentation was inconvenient for the

employees. 2) There is no evidence that the removal of ineligible dependents caused the

disenrollment of eligible dependents within the same family or changed the family’s choice of

health plans. 3) The program generated annual cost savings of roughly $46 per enrolled

employee, though as we discuss below, these are primarily private gains. 4) Finally, an important

interaction with the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will likely attenuate the potential cost savings

of all DV plans from 2011 onwards: We find that a substantial fraction of the cost savings of the

DV program was generated by removing ineligible older children, and the Affordable Care Act

essentially renders all older children up to age 26 eligible, removing them as targets of DV

programs. Hence, as the state governments and private employers that have implemented DV


                                                 6	  

	  
programs adapt to the new regulatory environment, the popularity of dependent verification

programs may well diminish.


       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the

provisions of the DV program. Section 3 discusses the data, and exhibits some preliminary

calculations. In Section 4 we outline the econometric strategy, and present the basic results.

Section 5 looks at whether compliance costs have an effect on disenrollment behavior, presents

an estimate of the program’s cost savings for the Employer, speculates about the welfare effects

of the program, and discusses the interaction between DV programs and the Affordable Care Act

of 2010. Section 6 concludes.


2. Description of the Dependent Verification (DV) Plan


       We study the DV program of a large, single-site employer in the service sector that had

about 6,000 employees over the study period, of whom about 5,100 were enrolled in its health

insurance program each year. The Employer offered a standard set of insurances plans;

employees could choose among PPO (preferred-provider organization), POS (point of service),

or HMO (health maintenance organization) plans. Comparisons of the Employer’s plan

characteristics to national averages reported by the Kaiser Family Foundation show that

employee take-up rates and employee contributions to premiums were typical among employers

of similar size over the study period. As is also conventional, employees chose their health care

plan every fall. Very few employees leave the Employer between December, when enrollment

decisions are finalized, and the subsequent January, when they take effect.




                                                 7	  

	  
                                                           Prior to open enrollment for 2010, which occurred in late 2009, employees did not need

to provide documentation to verify that dependents on their health insurance policies were

eligible for inclusion. In late 2009, the Employer announced that starting during the open

enrollment period for 2010, employees would have to authenticate the status of their

dependents.6 Verification took place throughout the open enrollment period and was essentially

complete by early December. Even for the one-off and problematic cases, all verification was

complete before January 31, 2010.7 Executives at the Employer report that they decided to

implement the DV program as a cost saving measure in line with industry best practices. The DV

program was entirely designed and administered by the Employer; no consultants were involved.

The program applied different criteria for eligibility to various groups of dependents. The details

are summarized in Figure 1. In all cases, some sort of documentary evidence was required. For

spouses, for example, the employee was required to provide both a marriage certificate and a

redacted tax return from the previous year, with the tax return serving to prove that the claimed

marital status was still current.8 In subsequent years, all new enrollees were required to provide

          The Employer implemented no other changes in compensation or benefits practices at this time.

As far as we know, there were no relevant significant changes in state or federal law at the time that

the DV program was implemented, but even if there were, their impact would be absorbed by the

time effects in our econometric model.
7
          In cases where dependents were removed, they were allowed to be added back to the employee’s

coverage mid-year, provided that the proper documentation was received. However, such

dependents were not enrolled retroactively. This situation arose in only a very few cases.
8
          This raises the question of why an individual would want to keep a divorced spouse on his or her

policy. Our data do not allow us to provide a definitive answer, but it is important to note that

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    8	  

	  
such documentation, but no attempts were made to re-verify that existing dependents (who had

already passed their initial screen) were still legitimately enrolled, although the Human

Resources Department made a special effort to prevent employees from adding someone who

had been denied coverage in a previous audit.


                                                          The provisos relating to dependent children are particularly important. All biological,

adopted and foster children up to age 18 who were claimed as dependents on federal tax returns

were eligible enrollees. For many years, the Employer had also allowed older children to be

included on an employee’s policy up to the end of the year in which the child turned 25.9

However, these older children either had to be full time students who provided less than half of

their own support and who listed the employee’s address as their own permanent address, or they

had to live with the employee and the employee had to provide over one half of their support.

These conditions were identical in the year prior to and the year following introduction of the

DV program. However, prior to 2010, employees were not required to provide evidence that

these conditions were met. In the absence of verification, an enrolled dependent “child” might

have been ineligible for several reasons. First, the enrolled dependent may not have truly been a

child, but rather a grandchild, some other family relation, or no relation at all. Second, even an

actual (natural, adopted, or foster) child would have been ineligible if the child was older than

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
divorce settlements sometimes require one spouse to continue providing health insurance for the

other. The Employer explicitly notes that ex-spouses are ineligible, even if the employee has a

Qualified Domestic Relations Order requiring him or her to provide health insurance coverage.

          This cutoff was the Employer’s choice; there was no applicable federal or state mandate stating

that employer-provided policies had to include 25 year old children.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         9	  

	  
25, or the child was under 25 but did not meet the other requirements. In short, ineligible

children were either not the employee’s children or they were children but did not satisfy the

other criteria in Figure 1.


        A final issue relates to same-sex domestic partners. Prior to the DV program, an

employee who wanted to include a same-sex domestic partner on his or her policy had to provide

an affidavit of domestic partnership. The Employer provided a list of 11 documents that could

be used to support the affidavit (e.g., a Qualifying Domestic Partnership Agreement, joint bank

account, joint mortgage agreement, durable property or health care power of attorney). The

employee could in principle be requested at any time to confirm that the affidavit was truthful by

producing any three documents from the list. In practice, though, such documents were never

requested prior to the DV program. After introduction of the DV program, they routinely were.


3. Data


        Our data are drawn from the Employer’s administrative records. They are proprietary

and were provided to us on a confidential basis. All identifying information, such as Social

Security numbers, was removed from the records, although scrambled identifiers were provided

to allow us to link enrollment records for families and individuals over time. The quality of the

administrative data was excellent: only two observations were dropped because of missing data,

and only a few observations were dropped due to apparent inconsistencies. Our data cover the

period December 2007 to January 2012 for all enrolled employees and their enrolled dependents,

if any. For each individual, the data include his or her relationship to the employee, age, gender,

and the type of plan in which he or she was enrolled (HMO, PPO, POS). Finally, the data include

each employee’s job category and banded salary.
                                                10	  

	  
                                                           We observe enrollment status at two points in each calendar year. The computations of

enrollment and disenrollment rates used throughout the analysis are based on comparisons of the

enrollment status of individuals on December 1 of a given year (after open enrollment decisions

are made for the following year but before they go into effect) and January 31 of the subsequent

year (after the decisions are in effect).10 In the analysis that follows, we examine re-enrollment

across plan years, counting employees or dependents who were enrolled in December but not in

the subsequent January as having disenrolled. It is possible that some individuals did not show

up as enrolled because the employed family member left the Employer between December and

January, but according to staff in the Human Resources department, such departures were no

more common than between any other pair of adjacent calendar months. More importantly, as

explained below, our econometric strategy takes into account any month-to-month turnover that

is similar across years or is similar in a single year among both employees and dependents in the

same family.


                                                           Our analysis sample includes only the employees and their family members who are

enrolled in the Employer’s plans at some point.11,12 The unit of observation is a person-year.

               The new plan choices actually go into effect on January 1. However, the specialists in the

Employer’s benefits office reported that there are sometimes errors and discrepancies in the records

at the start of the year, so it is safer to use the information as of January 31, after most of the

corrections have been made.
11
          Because not all employees enroll, our analysis sample is only a subset of the entire population of

employees. According to the Human Resources staff, the characteristics of the members of this

subset are similar to those of the remainder of the employee population.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    11	  

	  
That is, each year that an individual was enrolled is associated with an observation for that

individual. For example, if an individual (employee or dependent) was enrolled in 2008 and

2009, then he or she would account for two observations. Table 1 shows summary statistics

computed over all observations. The first column shows the figures for enrolled employees, the

second for dependent spouses and the third for dependent children.


                                                          The figures indicate that the number of enrolled dependents is slightly larger than the

number of enrolled employees, underscoring the potential contribution of dependents to total

plan costs. About half of enrollees are female, though women are somewhat more likely to be

dependents than employees. The average employee who has insurance coverage through the

Employer enrolls one dependent, generating an average family size of 2 in the sample.


                                                          The last row of Table 1 reports the fraction of individuals enrolled in December of a year

who are still enrolled in January of the following year. The average re-enrollment rate among

employees from December to January is 0.98. The rates are slightly lower for spouses and

children.


                                                          Figure 2 provides a first look at the possible impacts of the DV program. It shows the

reenrollment rates of employees and dependents from December to January for 2007-08 through

2011-12. We focus on re-enrollment, rather than all flows into enrollment in order to remove the

               This is a common feature of studies analyzing administrative health plan data, and one that poses

no particular econometric challenge here, since our focus is on whether previously-enrolled

employees and dependents (a group which we observe) re-enroll differentially across the policy

change (an outcome which we also observe).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    12	  

	  
noise associated with new hires and other families who enter the system in a given year. Because

our focus is on re-enrollment, any effects of the DV program should appear only in the policy

change year: In the years after program implementation, any new dependents flowing into

enrollment will have been verified as eligible, leaving no stocks of ineligibles for the program to

bar during the annual re-enrollment period. The key question, therefore, is whether there are

differences between re-enrollment in 2009-10, when the program was introduced, and the years

preceding and following.


                                                           The first two panels show the results for employees without and with dependents,

respectively. By definition, employees’ eligibility for health insurance was not affected by the

introduction of the DV program, so that, in effect, they serve as a control group. Consistent with

this notion, regardless of whether or not they had dependents, their re-enrollment rate in 2009-10

is similar to the other years, between 98 and 99 percent. In contrast to the stability of re-

enrollment behavior for employees, the third panel shows that the re-enrollment rate for

dependents in 2009-10 is substantially lower (93.7 percent) than either before (96.1 percent for

2008-09) or after (97.1 percent for 2010-11).13 Taken together, the three panels suggest that the

increased disenrollment rates for dependents in the year the DV program was introduced were

not due to some overall change in the environment that affected employees and dependents alike.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
13
               After the implementation of the program, re-enrollment would return to its pre-program steady

state so long as the natural re-enrollment rates of the pre- and post-DV populations do not differ.

More precisely, the condition required to return to pre-DV re-enrollment rates is that the re-

enrollment rate of eligible dependents be the same as re-enrollment rate of ineligibles. There is no a

priori reason to expect differential re-enrollment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    13	  

	  
       Although the program targeted only dependents, it is conceivable that the enrollment of

employees could be impacted indirectly by affecting their dependents. This could happen, for

example, if in response to the policy an entire family migrated to a spouse’s health plan at

another employer. Nonetheless, as noted above, Panel B shows that, just as with employees

without previously enrolled dependents, employees with such dependents continue to re-enroll

themselves in 2009-2010 at rates similar to adjacent years. This provides further evidence of the

suitability of using (all) employees as a control group.


       The dependent re-enrollment rate in 2011 appears higher than in the policy change year

(2010) or the two years preceding it. We provide some evidence below that this phenomenon is

related to the dependent coverage provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which went into

effect in 2011 and mandated that employers must offer coverage to children up to age 26

regardless of whether the children reside with the parent or are dependent on the parent in any

way. Indeed, as shown in the next section, the increased reenrollment in 2011 in our data is

concentrated entirely among older children, which is consistent with the notion that this change

was induced by the ACA. We discuss the interaction between the ACA and dependent

verification programs in more detail below.


       While Figure 2 is interesting and informative, it leaves some important loose ends. First,

we don’t know whether the apparently large difference that we observe in 2009-10 is due to

ineligibles disenrolling or just random variation. Second, this coarse-grained summary does not

allow us to examine in detail which groups of dependents and employees are associated with the

most ineligible enrollments. Finally, the graphs exploit neither the panel nature of our data, nor

the information that links family members to one another. As we show below, this information

                                                 14	  

	  
can be used to make inferences about whether dependents who disenrolled due to DV were

actually ineligible or merely discouraged from re-enrolling due to the costs of complying with

the program. We now develop an econometric approach for addressing these issues.


4. Econometric Strategy and Results


       4.1 Setup


       We estimate a series of linear probability models that take the following form:

                                                               !"#!

         re-­‐enroll!"# =    α! + 𝛾 ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡! +                    𝛿! ∗ 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟!                                                                            
                                                           !!!""#

                              !"#!

                         +            𝜆! ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡! ×𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟!    +    𝑿𝒊𝒋𝒕 𝜷 +    𝜀!"#
                             !!!""#



In this equation, individuals are indexed by i and families by j, and re-enrollit equals one if

individual i re-enrolled in the Employer’s health plan in January of year t. The sample is

comprised only of individuals enrolled in December of year t – 1, and includes up to 5

enrollment transitions for each person: December 2007 to January 2008, December 2008 to

January 2009, December 2009 to January 2010, December 2010 to January 2011, and December

2011 to January 2012. We focus on this narrow window around the start of the new year to

reduce the likelihood of picking up disenrollment that is due to natural attrition over the course

of a full year. The time effects capture any influences common to the enrollment decisions of all

potential enrollees in a given year. Yeart is an indicator for observations in January of year t; the

omitted year is 2008. The indicator dependenti equals one if the individual is a dependent (either

a spouse or child), and zero otherwise. Hence, the coefficients on the interactions between

                                                      15	  

	  
dependenti and the time effects tell us whether there was a change in the probability of a

dependent being enrolled in a given year relative to the change for employees. The coefficients

on these interaction terms are analogous to the differences between the employee reenrollment

and dependent reenrollment rates in Figure 2. In short, we are estimating a differences-in-

differences model, in which the impact of the DV program is measured by the coefficient on

dependenti x 2010. A negative significant coefficient would indicate that the program was in fact

curbing the re-enrollment of dependents who were ineligible but nonetheless were enrolled prior

to the program.


                                                           The other covariates in Xijt include individual i’s age and gender, and the employed

family member’s age, gender, salary (8 quantiles), staff group (8 categories), and business unit (3

categories).14 The term εijt is a random error; standard errors are clustered at the family level,

which subsumes clustering observations for individuals across the panel.


                                                           Because the model does not assume linear time trends, even this basic specification

allows for falsification tests. Specifically, a violation of our identifying assumption would show

up as a non-zero coefficient on any of the interactions between dependent status and the 2009,

2011, and 2012 year effects (coefficients λ2009, λ2011, and λ2012). That is, none of the coefficients

on these variables should be significantly different from zero.

          This set of categories is more detailed than what we report in the summary statistics for tractability

and in order to preserve the Employer’s anonymity.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    16	  

	  
         A slightly more complex specification allows us to take advantage of the panel nature of

the data as well as to exploit the fact that we can identify individuals in the same family. This

specification contains a family fixed effect interacted with each year effect:

The coefficients on the family-by-year effects, Δ!" , reflect any enrollment patterns that are

common to all family members in any given year. The inclusion of the family-by-year effects

thus ensures that the coefficient of interest (on dependenti x 2010) captures only deviations of the

enrollment of the dependent from the rest of the family, including and especially the employee.


         4.2 Basic results.


         The basic results are reported in Table 2. Column (1) shows the estimates when the only

variables on the right hand side are the time effects, the dichotomous variable for dependent

status (dependenti), and their interactions. Column (2) adds the control variables; column (3)

adds the family fixed effects, and column (4) adds interactions between the family and time

effects. The results are remarkably similar across the various specifications, and can be

summarized as follows. 1) The coefficient on dependenti x 2010 is between -0.023 and -0.027,

depending on the specification, and in all cases it is significant at the 0.001 level. This 2.3 to 2.7

percentage point reduction in the probability of being enrolled (corresponding to around 120 to


                                                          17	  

	  
140 individuals) is consistent with the notion suggested by Figure 2: the DV program succeeded

in reducing the number of ineligible dependents enrolled. Although this estimate is lower than

those reported by some organizations, it is in line with figures from others. It is, for example,

just about equal to the proportion of ineligibles that an audit at the University of Nebraska

claimed to have turned up several years ago (Lechner [undated]). 2) On the other hand, the

coefficients on the interactions between dependenti and the time effects other than the year in

which the DV plan was introduced are all insignificant. The coefficients on dependenti x 2009,

dependenti x 2011, and dependenti x 2012 represent three opportunities to falsify the identifying

assumption that dependent re-enrollment trends did not diverge from employee re-enrollment

trends, except during the policy change year. Hence, this finding that they are not statistically

different from zero (except for a single coefficient on dependenti x 2012 in column (3), which is

not significant in any other specification) lends credibility to our identification strategy. 3) The

coefficients on the time effects in columns (1) and (2) are small in magnitude and generally

insignificantly different from zero. Thus, for employees there is no overall trend in reenrollment

over time. In the column (3) specification these effects are significant, but even so there is no

jump in 2010, implying that the policy change had no detectable impact on the enrollment of

employees themselves. 4) The coefficients on dependenti indicate that, in general, dependents are

2 or 3 percentage points less likely to reenroll than employees. The higher turnover in

enrollment for dependents is unsurprising, because spouses may find insurance through their

own employers and may take children with them, and some fraction of enrolled children

naturally age out of coverage eligibility every year. Although not unexpected, it is reassuring to

see this intuitive result.

                                                           Our basic model assumes that the effect of the DV program was the same across all types

of dependents, regardless of their characteristics and the characteristics of the employees with

whom they were associated. We now explore the outcomes when this assumption is relaxed.


                                                           Differences by type of dependent. Some dependents are spouses; others are children. To

allow for different responses to the introduction of DV, we create the indicator variables childi,

which equals one if the dependent was a child, and spousei, which equals one if the dependent

was a spouse. We include these variables (instead of dependenti) in our basic regression, as well

as interactions between them and the time effects. The results are in column (1) of Table 3. For

brevity we report only the coefficients on the interaction terms. The results suggest that the

disenrollment effect is about twice as strong for children as for spouses—2.9 percentage points

for children versus 1.5 percentage points for spouses. Both are statistically significant at the 0.05

level.15


                                                           We next examine whether the effect of DV varies with the dependent’s age. To do so, in

column (2) we augment our model with triple interactions between the child x [year] variables

and an indicator for turning 24 before the end of the plan year. While there is inevitably some

arbitrariness in choosing an age cutoff, 24 years seems a natural threshold, given that, as

indicated in Figure 1, it was the age at which the eligibility criteria became additionally

               In a model that includes all controls and family fixed effects, the difference between the child and

spouse coefficients is significant (p = .01). In a model that includes family-by-year effects, the

magnitude of the difference is similar but the standard errors are larger, rendering the difference

insignificant (p = .14.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    19	  

	  
stringent.16 The additional interaction terms mean that the child x [year] coefficients in column

(2) have a different interpretation from their counterparts in column (1), as the former reflect the

enrollment trends of younger children only.


                                                           The results indicate that the effect of the program among younger children was small and

not statistically significant. Among older children, however, the program impact was dramatic.

Re-enrollment among children 24 and older declined by 19.5 (=18.6 + 0.9) percentage points in

the year of the reform. On this basis, we think that the most likely explanation for disenrollment

among children is not that employees were falsely claiming that (say) nieces and nephews were

their children, because this could happen at any age. An alternative explanation is that

employees were lying about the ages of their older children in order to meet the age

requirements. However, staff from the Employer’s Human Resources department told us that

misrepresenting a child’s age was highly unlikely, because the date of birth in the Employer’s

records was routinely cross checked against claims submitted by health providers. Another

possibility is that the compliance costs of verifying dependent status were particularly high for

older children, but this seems unlikely as well. For younger children, parents were required to

provide birth certificates and redacted tax forms; the incremental effort for older children would

generally involve nothing more than presenting a tuition bill or signing a statement attesting to

the child’s status. We conclude that the most likely reason for the large effects among older

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
16
               In any case, the substantive result that effects are larger among older children is not sensitive to

the choice of age cutoff, although the effect is strongest at age 24, supporting the importance of the

additional eligibility criterion at age 24. See the online appendix, in which we provide estimates with

the age threshold for the interaction set to each age between 18 and 26.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    20	  

	  
children is that they did not meet the various criteria listed in Figure 1 that pertained specifically

to older ages. That is, older children were probably ineligibly enrolled because they were not

students, they were not living at home with the parent, and/or the parent wasn’t providing at least

half of the child’s support.17


                                                           As an aside, we note that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandated that beginning in

2011, all children be eligible for inclusion on their parents’ health plans until the end of the year

at which the child turns 26, regardless of the child’s marital status or whether the child is

financially supported by his parents. The impact of this provision of the ACA is evident in

column (2), where the coefficient on child x older x 2011 implies a 14.9 percentage point

increase for children 24 and older. We return below to discussing the interactions between the

ACA and DV programs.


                                                           Differences by type of employee. We next explore whether the disenrollment effects

differ across groups of employees. Table 4 shows parameter estimates for subsamples based on

employee’s income and type of job. We first explore whether the effects of DV differ between

higher-earning (above the 25th percentile) and low-earning (below the 25th percentile) employees.

Comparing the figures in columns (1) and (2), we see that the point estimate of the disenrollment

effect is much larger for families in which the employee’s earning are below the 25th percentile

(4.4 percentage points) than above it (1.8 percentage points). The difference between the two

groups is marginally statistically significant (p=.10).

               Unlike the case for children, triple interactions between the spouse’s age and the spouse x [year]

variables (reported in the appendix) suggested no robust differences in program impacts for older

versus younger spouses.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    21	  

	  
similar results: thresholds set at the 10th, 25th, 40th, or 50th percentiles yield larger effects for the

lower income group, but in all cases other than the 25th percentile, the differences by income are

not statistically significant.18


                                                           In columns (3) and (4), we display results by job type. For tractability, we collapse the 3

business units and 8 staff groups into 2 job types, “maintenance/service” and “other,” a category

that includes professionals, managers, and support staff. The most striking finding is the size of

the disenrollment effect for families in which employees are classified as maintenance/service.

The program decreased re-enrollment among this group by 6.7 percentage points, an effect that is

statistically different and about four times larger than for other types of employees.19 It is not

immediately clear why the disenrollment effects should be so large for maintenance and service

workers. Because the regression controls for income, the fact that maintenance and service

workers have relatively low incomes is probably not the explanation. The Employer’s Human

Resources staff pointed out to us that many of these employees are not native speakers of

English, and conjectured that prior to the DV program, these workers simply might not have

understood fully the criteria for putting a dependent onto one’s health insurance policy.


                                                           Finally, in Table 5 we examine the differences between the impact of the DV program on

spouses and partners in same-sex versus opposite-sex couples. Because the models with family-

               All percentiles are approximate. All computations assessing statistical significance in this paragraph

are based on specifications in which all observations are pooled and the income cutoffs are

interacted with dependent*2010.
19
               Further subdividing the non-maintenance workers in column (4) into more detailed subgroups

yields similar coefficients to those in column (4), but they are estimated with less precision.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    22	  

	  
by-year effects are less precisely estimated, we include specifications both with and without

them. The results indicate that disenrollment of spouses/partners is much larger among same-sex

couples (14.0 percentage points) than among opposite-sex couples (1.7 percentage points), and

the difference is statistically significant. Why was there such a large impact upon same-sex

couples? Prior to the implementation of DV in 2010, employees who wanted to include a same-

sex partner or spouse on their policy had to sign an affidavit attesting that all the qualifications

(as outlined in Figure 1) had been met. The Employer reserved the right to check the relevant

documentation, but in practice, never did so. However, under the DV program, the documents

were actually checked. Apparently, a substantial proportion of same-sex relationships did not

meet one of more of the qualifications, so these partners and spouses were dropped from the

policies.


5. Mechanisms and Implications


        5.1 Spillovers


        A DV program might have impacts beyond the targeted ineligibles. In particular, there

are at least three ways in which the program could have affected the enrollment decisions and

plan choices of eligible employees and dependents. First, employees who could no longer enroll

their ineligible dependents in the Employer’s plans might have chosen to switch to a spouse’s

employer plan that accepted the barred dependent, in order to keep their family under a single




                                                  23	  

	  
plan. However, Panel B of Figure 2 suggests this was not the case—there was no discernible

change in employee re-enrollment patterns when DV was introduced.20


                                                           Second, the policy might have induced eligible enrollees to switch plans within the menu

offered by the Employer. Because all family members must be on the same plan (HMO, PPO, or

POS), removing an ineligible dependent could change a family’s relative valuations of the plans

by altering the composition of the family members who would be covered by them. We

investigated this possibility by comparing plan-switching behavior of employees who enrolled at

least one dependent in the prior year with that of employees enrolling only themselves, since the

latter group could not be affected by this mechanism.21 There was no significant difference

between the two groups, again providing no evidence of unintended spillovers.


                                                           Third, even if the employee remains enrolled, families may have adjusted to the policy by

removing both eligible and ineligible dependents to a spouse’s plan at another employer. This

would be particularly appealing for spouses whose employers do not charge incremental

premiums for family members added to a family plan. This issue is discussed in the next

subsection.


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
20
               Supplemental regressions (available in the online appendix) confirm that there were no significant

differences in re-enrollment between employees with and without dependents, offering no evidence

of enrollment spillovers to employees.

21
               Specifically, we estimated a linear probability model in which the left hand side variable was an

indicator for whether the employee changed plan choice, and the right hand side included the

interactions employee x [year] as well as triple interactions of employee x had dependents x [year].

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    24	  

	  
       5.2 Is Disenrollment a Symptom of Cheating or Compliance Costs?


       So far, we have shown that the dependent verification program succeeded in reducing the

number of enrolled dependents without causing the disenrollment of eligible employees. But this

begs the question of whether these dependents were truly ineligible or if employees were simply

discouraged from enrolling eligible family members because of the costs of finding and

presenting the required documentation. It seems unlikely that any such compliance costs could

exceed the anticipated benefits of enrolling legitimate dependents, since the average payout of

the insurer on behalf of each enrollee was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, some critics of

DV programs have argued that they are intended specifically to discourage legitimate dependents

from enrolling. A commenter on one online article opined that DV programs “disqualify

legitimate dependents because they know that 5 to 8 % of employees will not read the paperwork

or do anything about the audit until it is too late to fix it" (Hobson [2010]).


       To investigate this issue, we begin with the following proposition: If an employee with

several dependents incurs the compliance costs of re-enrolling one or two of them, then the

marginal cost of enrolling an additional dependent is probably small. Consider, for example, an

employee who enrolled a spouse and a child in 2009. To re-enroll the spouse in 2010, the

employee would have to bring a marriage certificate and a redacted 2008 tax return to Human

Resources. In order to re-enroll the child, the incremental paperwork would consist of only a

birth certificate. No additional trip to the Human Resources department would be needed, and no

additional tax document would be required, because the same 2008 tax return would serve to

verify both the spouse and child. Therefore, if we were to observe an employee dropping one

dependent while re-enrolling the other, it would provide some evidence against the compliance

                                                  25	  

	  
costs story. Likewise, an employee frustrated or confused by the DV program would probably

not choose to re-enroll only a subset of his family members.


       In short, we can assess the importance of compliance costs by examining whether

employees with several dependent family members dropped all or only some of them at the time

of the policy change. To do so, we construct a sample that is limited to families with two or more

enrolled dependents in the previous year, and then re-configure the data so that the unit of

observation is a family-year (as opposed to a person-year, which is the case in the analyses

presented up to now). We next use this sample to estimate a series of linear probability models of

family-level re-enrollment. In our first regression, the left-hand-side variable takes a value of one

if the employee drops all of his or her dependents in the plan year. The right hand side variables

include year effects and our standard set of employee-level covariates. If employees chose to re-

enroll none of their dependents because of frustration or high compliance costs, we would expect

a positive coefficient on the indicator for 2010, the year when the program was introduced. In the

second regression, the left-hand-side variable takes a value of one only if the number of

dependents re-enrolled falls to some level above zero, and in the third, the dependent variable

equals one only if exactly one dependent is dropped. The right hand side variables are the same

as in the first model. If employees re-enroll some but not all of their dependents, we would

expect a positive coefficient on the 2010 indicator in these latter two models. Such a finding

would be consistent with the notion that compliance costs are not an important consideration.




                                                 26	  

	  
                                                           The results are reported in Table 6.22 The three columns correspond to the three models

just described. In column (1), the coefficient on the indicator for 2010 is a precisely estimated

zero, suggesting that the DV program had no discernible impact on the likelihood of employees

dropping all of their family members. Columns (2) and (3) show that there was a significant

jump in the probability of dropping some (but not all) dependents in 2010, compared to the years

preceding and following. Taken together, the results in Table 6 indicate that it was not the

inconvenience of gathering and delivering documentation to the Human Resources department

that drove the decline in dependent re-enrollment we report above, because the employees who

dropped a dependent in response to the policy change did, in fact, gather and deliver verification

documents for their other family members.


                             Table 6 also provides some evidence that the program didn’t cause spillover disenrollment

among eligible dependents. Such an effect might occur, for example, if barring an ineligible

child from enrollment induced an eligible spouse to decline coverage in order to enroll the child

in his or her own employer’s plan. Similarly, among families in which the spouse already had

coverage from his or her own employer, if the family could move the ineligible child dependent

to the spouse’s plan, it would provide a strong incentive to move the remaining children to the

spouse’s plan as well, since the marginal cost of adding a second or third child to a family health

plan is often zero (and the marginal savings of removing the remaining children from the

Employer’s plan would have been substantial). Column (1) of Table 6, which shows that

               The coefficients in this table are not directly comparable to others in the paper because the unit of

observation is a family-year rather than a person-year.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    27	  

	  
employees were no more likely to remove their entire set of dependents from coverage in the

policy change year than in other years, suggests these effects were not taking place.


                             5.3 Cost savings


                             So far, our focus has been on measuring the reduction of ineligible dependents induced by

the DV program. Assessing the benefits of the program to the Employer, however, requires

information about the associated decline in outlays for health care claims. The promoters of DV

programs assert that these reductions are large. As one news report said, “Audit firms say

companies are often surprised by the savings…[T]he average annual health-care cost is about

$3,000 per dependent” (Epstein and McGregor [2007]). In this context, an important question is

whether the dependents who were dropped from coverage due to the program were more or less

expensive than average. One might expect that ineligible enrollees would be relatively

expensive, since the value of illegitimately enrolling in a plan is highest for exactly those people

who face high expected medical costs.


                             The Employer was able to provide us with data on costs only for plan year 2009, so we

cannot follow our basic difference-in-difference strategy to estimate whether dependents who

disenrolled in 2010 were higher cost than in other years. Instead, to investigate this issue, we

simply compare the average claim amounts (payouts by the insurer on behalf of the enrollee) of

2010 renewers and non-renewers in the year prior to the change, 2009. 23 It is important to


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
23
               More precisely, cost differences are estimated from a regression of plan costs on re-enrollment

status interacted with indicators for spouse and child, and in the case of children, further interacted

with an indicator for age between 22 and 25.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    28	  

	  
understand the limitations of this exercise: The set of children and spouses who did not re-enroll

in 2010 includes both ineligible dependents who were screened out by the DV program and other

dependents who would have naturally aged out of eligibility or left coverage for other reasons.

More precisely, our estimates imply that of all the children 24 or older who did not renew

enrollment in 2010, only 57 percent were dropped as a result of the DV program and the rest left

for other reasons. Likewise, only 32 percent of the non-renewals among spouses/partners can be

attributed to the DV program.


                             With these caveats in mind, we compute that among children 24 to 2524, the average

healthcare claims in 2009 of those who were not re-enrolled in 2010 were $903 lower (p=.09)

than of those whose coverage continued across the 2010 policy change. Similarly, among

spouses and covered partners, the average costs for those who left coverage in 2010 were lower

by $1410 (p=.13) than for those who remained enrolled. Thus, we find no apparent evidence that

ineligibles tended to incur higher costs. Interestingly, this suggestive evidence that dependents

who re-enrolled had larger health costs than those who did not is consistent with the notion of

“adverse retention”—the tendency of individuals who remain in a plan to reinforce cost

differentials between plans (Altman, Cutler and Zeckhauser [1998]).


                             In any case, even if ineligible dependents did not generate disproportionately large healthcare

costs, their consumption of any health benefits nonetheless produces costs for both employers

and employees (in proportion to the incidence of health insurance costs on each). To provide a

rough gauge of the size of the total cost savings, we take the average 2009 cost of dependents

               We focus on children 24 and older because we found no significant disenrollment effects of the

DV program on younger children.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    29	  

	  
and multiply it by our implied estimate of the number of ineligible dependents who were

disenrolled due to the DV program.25 Doing so yields a total savings of $233,900 in 2010, which

amounts to $46 per enrolled employee.26


                             5.4 Welfare Issues


                                                           We have shown that the DV program reduced the number of ineligible dependents on

insurance policies, but this is far from saying that it improved social welfare, the calculation of

which involves costs and benefits accruing to a range of agents. First consider the potential

winners from the policy. Employers that institute DV plans are better off because their

expenditures for health benefits decrease. To the extent that the incidence of these expenditures

falls on employees, the employees who were not carrying ineligible dependents share this gain.

However, any such benefits must be net of the costs of administering the plans. Although the

Employer examined in this paper was not able to provide us with a figure, other sources have

suggested costs of about $20 to $30 per employee [Epstein and McGregor [2007]]. 27

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
25
               These figures are based on a regression similar to our main specification, but allowing separate

coefficients for the effects on spouses and on children above and below age 24. We then multiply

the implied disenrollment effects by the average 2009 costs of enrollees in each of these three

groups.
26
               Alternatively, one could multiply the implied disenrollment effects by the average 2009 costs among

only the enrollees who do not re-enroll in 2010. Doing so yields a total savings of $185,800 in 2010 , or $36

per enrolled employee.
27
               Though Epstein and McGregor [2007] are not specific on this point, these are likely the costs for

each verification procedure, and would recurr whenever an employer chose to re-verify an

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    30	  

	  
                                                          Who are the potential losers? If the dependents whose coverage is dropped remain

uninsured, then even in the absence of illness they (and their families) experience a decline in

utility because of the increased uncertainty they face. If an uninsured dependent does become ill,

someone has to pay the cost—the dependent, the employee, taxpayers (if the dependent ends up

on Medicaid), or a health care provider (if no one else will pay). If the dependent is put on a

spouse’s policy, then the spouse’s employer will face larger health care expenditures. As before,

depending on the incidence of employee health insurance expenditures, some of the burden may

be shifted to employees in the form of lower wages.


                                                          Two other possible effects on welfare are worth noting. First, consider adults who

respond to their ineligible status by signing up for health insurance through their own employers.

Efficiency is reduced to the extent that “job-lock” hinders their mobility in the labor market

(Monheit and Cooper [1994]). Second, while under a minimal set of assumptions it is true that

less insurance reduces an individual’s utility, we are operating in a second-best world in which

employees and their families are likely over-insured because of the implicit subsidy to employer-

provided health insurance embodied in the personal income tax. Hence, efficiency could be

enhanced to the extent that ineligible dependents end up with more modest insurance coverage.


                                                          In short, a complete calculation of the impact of DV plans on social welfare requires that

a variety of effects be taken into account. To our knowledge, there is no data set that would

allow one to undertake an analysis like this. It is clear, though, that the reduction in employers’

health insurance costs would play a central role in any such a calculation.

dependent population once, and then check only new dependent enrollees

                             5.5 The Affordable Care Act


                             The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated that beginning in 2011, all employer-sponsored

health insurance must offer coverage to children up to age 26. No other criteria can be set in

order to qualify. Evidence from the CPS indicates that the number of uninsured 19-25 year-olds

fell by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2011 (DeNavas-Walt, et al. [2012]).


                             The Employer’s health care plan was grandfathered; it could have kept the previous age

cutoff in place beyond the beginning of 2011. Nevertheless, the Employer chose to become

ACA-compliant effective September 1, 2010, and offered a special enrollment period at that

time.28 As Figure 2 shows, this pattern is consistent with our data—dependent re-enrollment

shows an uptick in 2011 (one year after the implementation of the DV program) and then a

reversion in 2012 back to the pre-program trend. The reason for the one-time spike is that prior

to 2011, the Employer covered children up to age 25. The ACA extended coverage to age 26 in

2011. Therefore, for 2011 only, there was a new inflow and retention of 26 year-olds without any

outflow of 27 year-olds, creating a high net re-enrollment rate. In 2012, the outflow of 27 year-

olds began, generating steady-state re-enrollment rates similar to the pre-2010 trend.	  


                             An alternative, though we believe incorrect, interpretation of the 2011 spike in re-enrollment

is that it is simply due to a compositional effect—the rolls were purged of ineligible dependents,

so that by definition the members of the remaining population were more likely to be eligible for

re-enrollment. However, because all new dependents were screened for eligibility in every year


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
28
               In the weeks and months before September 1, there was no slackening in enforcement of the pre-

ACA age cutoff.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    32	  

	  
after 2010, a compositional effect would have led to a steady-state increase in the re-enrollment

rate that continued into 2012, not the spike that we actually observe for 2011 only.


       As further evidence that the 2011 increase in re-enrollment was caused by the ACA, the

estimates in Table 3 suggest that this change is driven entirely by older children: There is a large

positive coefficient on child x older x 2011, but no significant effects on the corresponding

coefficient for younger children, and no significant effects on spouse x 2011. All of this is

consistent with a story in which 25-year-olds who otherwise would have aged out of the plan, or

would have exited because they were done with full-time schooling, could instead re-enroll for

an additional year because of the ACA.


       Because some of the largest DV program effects were among older children, the ACA has

muted the potential cost savings of the program. Based on the cost calculations above, about 43

percent of the cost savings were obtained by excluding employees’ children who failed to meet

some other dependency criterion. Hence, because the ACA rendered inoperative all employers’

restrictions on dependent eligibility for children up to age 26, a significant fraction of the

potential costs savings were erased. While we are not aware of any systematic surveys of the

types of restrictions US employers placed on child dependents prior to 2011, our conversations

with the Employer’s benefits administrators lead us to believe that restrictions on the eligibility

of older children were common. Hence, our finding is likely broadly applicable because, in

effect, the ACA redefined a large set of formerly ineligible dependents as eligible under all

employer-sponsored insurance plans. Further, children usually represent an even larger fraction

of the enrolled ineligibles than we find in our setting (Silva [2008]). If so, this effect of the ACA

on the cost-savings of DV programs will be widespread and substantial.

                                                  33	  

	  
6. Conclusions


       In order to reduce their health care costs, employers across the country have introduced

dependent verification programs, whose purpose is to remove ineligible dependents from

employees’ insurance policies. As far as we know, this paper is the first attempt to assess the

efficacy of such a program. Using panel data from a large, single-plant U.S. employer, we

implement a differences-in-differences econometric strategy to estimate the effect of a dependent

verification program that the Employer implemented in 2010. We find that the program reduced

re-enrollment among dependents by 2.7 percentage points. The effect was particularly strong for

children in their mid-20s, who likely did not meet the various conditions to qualify them as being

dependent on the employees. Re-enrollment among same-sex partners and spouses fell by about

13.6 percentage points, presumably because they did not meet all the Employer’s criteria for a

bona fide relationship. We find no evidence that disenrollment was caused by the putative

inconveniences associated with gathering and presenting the required verification. Rather, the

dropped dependents were most likely simply ineligible. We also find no evidence that these

policies spilled-over to induce disenrollment or plan switching among eligible individuals within

the same families as the affected ineligibles.


       Our data did not permit us to make a precise estimate of the cost savings associated with

the DV plan, but a rough calculation suggests that it saved the Employer studied here about $46

per employee per year. However, the Affordable Care Act, which bars any enrollment

restrictions on child dependents up to age 26, has erased some of the potential gains from DV

programs. Because this provision affects all employers and because children who don’t meet

certain criteria have generally been a ripe target for dependent verification programs, we believe

                                                 34	  

	  
this effect could be quite widespread. For the employer we study, we estimate the ACA reduced

the DV program’s potential cost savings by about 40 percent. Additionally, new non-group

markets that might arise via the ACA could increase the number of options outside of traditional

employer-provided policies, hence reducing the benefits from fraudulently enrolling ex-spouses

and other ineligibles in employer plans. These institutional changes, taken together with our

estimates of program effects and cost savings, suggest that employers and governments may

perceive a weaker case for implementing or continuing dependent verification programs in the

future.

This figure shows details of the DV program introduced by the Employer for open enrollment in the fall
of 2009. Because of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the dependency requirements for children have been
eliminated (since 2011). Employees can now enroll children through the end of the year in which the child
turns 26 regardless of marital, student, or residential status.

Each point shows the fraction of individuals who were reenrolled in the health plan in January of year t,                              20
conditional on having been enrolled in the plan in December of year t − 1. The 2009-10 transition is
associated with the introduction of the dependent verification program. 95% confidence intervals are
generated from a linear probability model in which re-enrollment is regressed on year indicators interacted

The unit of observation over which means are taken is the person-year—if a person was enrolled in the
health insurance plan three different years, then he or she counts as three observations. The first column
shows figures for employees only; the second and third columns are only for spouses and children,
respectively.

The coefficients are generated by linear probability models in which the left hand side variable is one if
the individual was enrolled in the health care program in January of year t, conditional on having been in
the program in December of year t-1. The sample includes up to 5 enrollment transitions for each person:
December 2007 to January 2008, December 2008 to January 2009, December 2009 to January 2010,
December 2010 to January 2011, and December 2011 to January 2012. Controls include the individual’s
own age and own gender, and the employed family member’s age, gender, salary (8 quantiles), staff group
(8 categories), and business unit (3 categories). Family fixed effects in column 3 are subsumed in column
4, which includes family-year interactions. Column 3 does not include the employed family member’s age
due to collinearity between age, employee fixed effects, and year effects. Standard errors in parentheses
are clustered at the family level, allowing correlation of enrollment decisions across time and correlation
among the members of each family. (∗ ) indicates that 42the coefficient is significant at the 0.05 level; (∗∗ ) at

In these models, the effects for dependent spouses and children are allowed to differ and are estimated via
separate interaction terms. The coefficients are generated by linear probability models, with the sample
and control variables defined as in Table 2. Year effects and main effects for spouse and child are included
in both models. In addition, the specification in column (2) includes interactions between older and the
child × [year] variables, where older is a a dichotomous variable equal to one if the child attained age 24
prior to December 31 of the plan year, and zero otherwise. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered
at the family level, allowing correlation of enrollment decisions across time and correlation among the
members of each family. (∗ ) indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 0.05 level; (∗∗ ) at the 0.01
level; and (∗∗∗ ) at the 0.001 level.

This table shows how the coefficient estimates vary by the employee’s income and job type. Each column
shows the results when the basic model is estimated using a different subsample. The coefficients are
generated by linear probability models in which the left hand side variable is one if the individual was
enrolled in the health care program in January of year t, conditional on having been in the program in
December of year t-1. The sample includes up to 5 enrollment transitions for each person: December
2007 to January 2008, December 2008 to January 2009, December 2009 to January 2010, December 2010
to January 2011, and December 2011 to January 2012. Year effects and main effects for spouse and child
are included in every model. Controls include the individual’s own age and own gender, and the
employed family member’s age, gender, salary (8 quantiles), staff group (8 categories), and business unit
(3 categories), except in specifications in which the sample is stratified by the respective covariates. The
job categories presented in columns (3) and (4) are coarser than the the business unit and staff group
controls that were made available to us in the interest of protecting the Employer’s anonymity. Family
fixed effects interacted with each year are included. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the
family level, allowing correlation of enrollment decisions across time and correlation among the members
of each family. (∗ ) indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 0.05 level; (∗∗ ) at the 0.01 level; and

This table shows how the coefficient estimates vary between same-sex and opposite sex couples. The
sample is limited to families that include a spouse or domestic partner. Columns (1) and (2) are
estimated using a subsample of families with opposite-sex spouses/partners. Columns (3) and (4) are
estimated using a subsample of families with same-sex spouses/partners. The coefficients are generated
by linear probability models in which the left hand side variable is one if the individual was enrolled in
the health care program in January of year t, conditional on having been in the program in December of
year t-1. The sample includes up to 5 enrollment transitions for each person: December 2007 to January
2008, December 2008 to January 2009, December 2009 to January 2010, December 2010 to January 2011,
and December 2011 to January 2012. Year effects and a main effect for child and spouse are included in
every model. Child-year interactions are included but not displayed. Controls include the individual’s
own age and own gender, and the employed family member’s age, gender, salary (8 quantiles), staff group
(8 categories), and business unit (3 categories). Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the family
level, allowing correlation of enrollment decisions across time and correlation among the members of each
family. (∗ ) indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 0.05 level; (∗∗ ) at the 0.01 level; and (∗∗∗ ) at
the 0.001 level.

The linear probability models in this table are estimated with a sample that includes only families with
two or more dependents. The unit of observation is a family-year, as opposed to previous tables, in which
the unit of observation is a person-year. In column (1) the left-hand-side variable equals one only if the
number of re-enrolled dependents falls to zero from a positive number. In column (2) the left-hand-side
variable equals one only if the number of re-enrolled dependents falls, but not all the way to zero. In
column (3) the left-hand-side variable equals one only if the number of re-enrolled dependents falls by
exactly one. The sample includes up to 5 enrollment transitions for each person: December 2007 to
January 2008, December 2008 to January 2009, December 2009 to January 2010, December 2010 to
January 2011, and December 2011 to January 2012. Controls include the employed family member’s age,
gender, salary (8 quantiles), staff group (8 categories), and business unit (3 categories). Standard errors
are clustered at the family level. (∗ ) indicates that the coefficient is significant at the 0.05 level; (∗∗ ) at
the 0.01 level; and (∗∗∗ ) at the 0.001 level.
