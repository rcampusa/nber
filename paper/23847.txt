Central banks have evolved for close to four centuries. This paper argues that for two centuries
central banks caught up to the strategies followed by the leading central banks of the era; the
Bank of England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the Federal Reserve in the
twentieth century. It also argues that, by the late 20th century, small open economies were more
prone to adopt a new policy regime when the old one no longer served its purpose whereas large,
less open, and systemically important economies were more reluctant to embrace new approaches
to monetary policy. Our study blends the quantitative with narrative explanations of the
evolution of central banks. We begin by providing an overview of the evolution of monetary
policy regimes taking note of the changing role of financial stability over time. We then provide
some background to an analysis that aims, via econometric means, to quantify the similarities and
idiosyncrasies of the ten central banks and the extent to which they represent a network of sorts
where, in effect, some central banks learn from others.

    1. Introduction


Central banks have evolved for close to four centuries. Their evolution was initially

tied up with meeting the fiscal needs of nascent states to finance government

expenditures in wars and to market the government’s debt. This was certainly true

of the Riksbank, originally named the Bank of the Estates of the Realm and created in

1668 and often referred to as the first central bank1, and even the Bank of England

created in 1694, in the midst of King William III’s war with France.2

They were not initially called central banks but rather banks of issue. The term central

bank only came into use in the late nineteenth century. Henry Thornton (1802) was

arguably one of the first to lay down concepts of central banking, including the role of

autonomy. 3 Later in the nineteenth century central banks played a key role in

managing the gold standard (i.e. following the “rules of the game”).

The era of the Gold Standard, which in one form or another was to last until the 1920s,

also saw the publication of Bagehot’s Lombard Street (1873) which suggested that a

central bank should be seen as a guarantor of financial stability by being a lender of

last resort.4

The definition of financial stability has changed significantly over time. In the

eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it meant avoiding or managing banking panics,

that is, serving as a lender of last resort to the banking system and the payments


1 The Riksbank was formed as a successor to its predecessor Stockholm Banco. It didn’t immediately

fund the government but did so later. See ( Fregert (2017).
2 As Bagehot (1873) famously remarked: “It was founded by a Whig government because it was in

desperate need of money, …”.
3 “To suffer the solicitations of merchants or the wishes of government to determine the measure of

bank issues is unquestionably to adopt a very false principle of conduct.” (Thornton 1802).
4 Perhaps best captured by Bagehot’s view that “money would not manage itself”.


                                                                                                  1
system. This changed in the twentieth century with the adoption of the real bills

doctrine, followed by the Federal Reserve in its early years. The real bills doctrine

urged a central bank to head off an asset price boom because it would lead to inflation,

then depression and deflation (Meltzer 2003, chapter 1). More recently, financial

stability encompasses both being a lender of last resort and preventing imbalances

that will lead to asset price booms and busts. Also the role of lender of last resort has

expanded to include the entire financial system not just the banking system.

    The pace of central bank creation intensified in the nineteenth century reflecting a

number of forces including the fiscal motive, the maintenance of specie convertibility

and managing financial crises, especially towards the end of the century. The Banks

founded included the Banque de France (1800), the Norges Bank (1816)5, the First

and Second Banks of the United States (1791 and 1816), the Bank of Japan (1882),

the Banca d’Italia (1893), and eventually the US Federal Reserve (1913). A few other

central banks (e.g., the Reichsbank (1873), and the Swiss National Bank (1907))

reflected attempts to centralize the currency issue and facilitate financial

transactions.

Central banks, because of their special status of having government charters and

because of their size, evolved into bankers’ banks and later into lenders of last resort.

The Bank of England is generally viewed as the first central bank to successfully

develop as a lender of last resort as is discussed in the Narrative Appendix in the

NBER Working Paper version of this chapter. However, other early central banks such



5 A political element played a role here as well because of the failed finances of Denmark which at the
time had jurisdiction over Norway. See, for example, Qvigstad (2016).

                                                                                                     2
as the Riksbank, and the Banque de France, engaged in rescue operations in the

nineteenth century. Indeed, the Banque de France in 1889 arranged a lifeboat

operation of the Comptoir D’ Escompte involving other commercial banks to provide

the resources to keep the bank afloat before a recapitalization could be arranged. The

Banque used very little of its own resources in the rescue but guaranteed the

participants in the event of losses (Hautcoeur, Riva, and White 2014). According to

the authors, the idea for the famous lifeboat rescue by the Bank of England of Barings

bank in 1890 in London came from the French operation the year before. In the late

twentieth century the Federal Reserve adopted the Too Big to Fail doctrine (Bordo

2014) but its first use goes back to several big bailouts in Germany in 1931 (Bordo

and James 2015). Thus, as we show below, with the LLR function as with other central

bank functions there was considerable learning among the central banking

community. Indeed, we provide some suggestive evidence of a relationship among

ten central banks that has all the markings of a network of a kind. In addition, along

with the lender of last resort function, they evolved as both providers and protectors

of the payments system.

In the twentieth century central banks took on the role of stabilizing the

macroeconomy (i.e., maintaining price stability), stabilizing the business cycle and

maintaining full employment. Since the 2007‐2008 crisis central banks have also

been given responsibility for financial stability, namely defusing financial imbalances

and asset price booms before they destabilize the economy. In so doing central banks

have only reprised a variant of a role that explains why many were created in the first

place (e.g., see De Kock 1974).


                                                                                     3
The dual requirements of a monetary policy geared towards stable economic

outcomes and a financial stability remit have always created challenges and this is

nowhere more evident than in recent years with central banks greatly expanding

their interventions in the financial system while struggling to meet inflation

objectives.

We consider the role of central banks in designing economic policy strategy and

regime choices. Table 1 from Siklos (2002, Table 1.2) lists the year of origin and the

primary motivation for the creation of 21 central banks in what are now referred to

as advanced economies (AE). That Table is updated to provide a few more details

about the 10 central banks that are the focus of the present study. If we exclude the

European Central Bank (ECB), we find that the gap between the first central bank

created (Sweden in 1668) and the last one (Canada in 1934) is 266 years. As noted

above, in most cases, there was a fiscal motivation (e.g., war finance) or an attempt to

stem the incidence of financial crises, that is, a financial stability imperative that

largely explains the creation of several central banks. The lender of last resort

function, often thought of as the raison d’être of central banking, grew in importance

in the late nineteenth and twentieth century.

Our study blends the quantitative with narrative explanations of the evolution of

central banks. Our quantitative analysis covers the period from 1870 to 2015. The

chosen sample reflects data limitations as well as the fact that central banks before

that period did not resemble the institutions we know today. Nevertheless, where

appropriate, we also examine data since the 17th century.




                                                                                      4
We begin in section 2 by providing an overview of the evolution of monetary policy

regimes taking note of the changing role of different meanings of financial stability

over time. In section 3, we then provide some background to an analysis that aims,

via econometric means, to quantify the similarities and idiosyncrasies of the ten

central banks and the extent to which they represent a network of sorts where, in

effect, some central banks learn from others. The empirical evidence is presented in

section 4. We examine a wide variety of evidence focusing on the behavior of inflation

differentials of various kinds, their determinants in a panel setting. We also consider

some counterfactuals that ask what inflation and real GDP performance might have

looked like in select economies in our data set had central banks appeared on the

scene earlier than was actually the case. Additional counterfactuals also consider how

inflation and economic growth might have evolved had inflation targeting not been

introduced in some of the countries that eventually adopted this monetary policy

strategy.

Small open economies are especially useful harbingers of reform and change in

central banking, most clearly during the second half of the twentieth century,

particularly in the aftermath of the Bretton Woods system which arguably represents

the last gasp of large economies dictating the monetary policy strategy of smaller and

more open economies. The small open economies evince greater responsiveness to

shocks emanating from the global and dominant economies over time. They also often

experience crises whose duration is less persistent but happen frequently enough to

prompt changes in how monetary policy is carried out. The combination of these two

findings suggests a greater willingness to change course when it is needed.


                                                                                     5
Overall, however, the economies considered remain crisis prone in spite of the

introduction and greater sophistication of monetary policy and central banking.

Financial crises impose considerable economic costs even if these may have declined

with improvements in central banking. Also, because of, or in spite of, exchange rate

systems the influence of central banks is global. Finally, section 5 concludes by

summarizing lessons learned and the current prospects for central banks.

In spite of notable developments in our understanding of how macroeconomies

function and how they respond to shocks, policy makers continue to search for

common features and hence a basis for cooperation across the many financial crises

that have plagued the global economy over the centuries. Unfortunately, this kind of

strategy does not bode well for the future of central banking for at least four reasons.

First, financial crises are not alike except in so far as they all, to a greater or lesser

extent, create significant to severe economic costs. Second, the central bank remains

a critical institution within government. Autonomy or independence cannot prevent

governments from eventually getting the monetary policy they want. Third, unless

the pendulum swings back to greater sharing of sovereignty across countries, an

unlikely scenario as this is written, domestic imperatives will ultimately dictate

central banks behavior. As a result, they will cooperate but only if it is beneficial for

them to do so. Finally, even if financial crises of the kind experienced in 2007‐8 (GFC)

and 2010‐12 (Eurozone sovereign debt crisis) are a thing of the past, political

economy considerations are unlikely to relegate to history booms and busts in

financial and business cycles.




                                                                                        6
As the current recovery in the real economy continues and the stance of monetary

policy tightens the likelihood that central banks will face a litmus test rises. And it is

quite possible that the next time will be different and central banks will lose their

prominence among the institutions responsible for carrying out stabilization policies.

Early indications are that this is already happening (e.g., see Geithner 2016).

   2. The Ebb and Flow of Policy Regimes

As is the case with many other institutions that evolve over time certain features

come to dominate before receding into the background as other more important

forces emerge. The same is true of central banks. While the supporting role in the

fiscal realm dominated the early history of many central banks this receded into the

background as financial crises and real shocks led to larger and more volatile business

cycle movements than governments were willing to tolerate. To be sure there were

fiscal implications from a change in the role of the central bank but the shift implied

that monetary authorities would henceforth stand squarely between financial

markets and other major economic stakeholders.

Business cycle volatility combined with the ever present desire to maintain some

form of price stability have also played a critical role in the evolution of central

banking. As Paul Volcker, former FOMC Chairman, once pointed out: “No doubt

several factors have contributed to enhancing the reputation of central banks.

However, given the responsibility for monetary policy, shifting perceptions with

respect to the importance of price stability must have been the most important.”

(Volcker 1990)




                                                                                        7
Once governments began to intervene more heavily to reduce the amplitude of

business cycle movements central banks moved from being subservient in the face of

fiscal demands to eventually becoming a bulwark against fiscal pressures for

monetary accommodation that would threaten to spill over into intolerably high

inflation rates. Of course, recent successes in limiting excessive inflation need not

imply that a permanent solution has been found, as we shall see. Indeed, any conquest

of inflation must be weighed against the current fashion in government at

maintaining a stable and sustainable fiscal policy. Were this view to change it is

difficult, again based on the historical experience, to see how central banks can stand

in the way of eventually accommodating the fiscal stance the politicians want.6

Beginning approximately in the 1950s, and culminating in the 1990s, central banks

around the world became more autonomous. After World War II many countries

adopted a full employment objective or nationalized their central banks so that they

could serve as a tool of macroeconomic policy (e.g., the US in 1945). This significantly

changed the mandate of central banks. Some, like the Fed, were required by

legislation to follow a dual mandate –to maintain both price stability and full

employment. In the US in the 1950s the Fed, under its chairman William McChesney

Martin, attached primary importance to price stability. He believed that price stability

would encourage economic growth and high employment (e.g., see Bremner 2004).




6 Even the German Bundesbank, celebrated as the model of central bank autonomy, was, as article 12

of the 1957 Law states (since replaced when the Bundesbank joined the European System of Central
Banks): “The Deutsche Bundesbank shall be bound, in so far as is consistent with its functions, to
support the general economic policy of the Federal government.” (Deutsche Bundesbank 1957, pg.
120). Needless to say, when the government’s and the central bank’s policies are inconsistent
conflicts emerge and the Bundesbank is no stranger to these.

                                                                                                 8
By the mid‐1960s, however, with the ascent of Keynesian thinking in the economics

profession in the US administration and inside the Federal Reserve, the goal of price

stability was made subservient to that of full employment. Similar shifts in thinking

occurred in the UK, Canada and the continent of Europe (with Germany and

Switzerland notable exceptions). Many argue that the belief in the ability to exploit

the Phillips Curve tradeoff was a key force leading to the Great Inflation from 1965 to

1983. Other factors such as political pressure (e.g., in the US to finance the Vietnam

war and the Great Society), accommodating two oil price shocks, the consistent

misreading of economic activity, and faulty analytics about what drives business cycle

activity, also contributed to the Great Inflation (see Bordo and Orphanides 2013). The

Great Inflation ended in the period 1979 to 1982 thanks to the pursuit of credible

anti‐inflation policies, especially by Paul Volcker in the US and Margaret Thatcher in

the UK, with similar actions in other countries later in the decade. This helped cement

the importance of central bank independence and facilitated the wave of legislative

changes that gave the monetary authorities the authority to carry out their policies

according to their assigned mandate. However, this strategy needed to be balanced

with the requirement of democratic accountability which, simultaneously, created

the pressure to promote greater transparency.

Moreover, independence never meant that the central banks were free to engage in a

monetary policy strategy of their own choosing. Rather, the monetary authorities, at

least in advanced economies, were given or negotiated a remit received from the

political authorities. Within the limitations of the tasks set out in legislation they were

free to choose the manner in which that remit was carried out. This is the principle


                                                                                         9
that came to be called instrument independence as distinct from goal independence.

The latter is normally set by the government (see Debelle and Fischer 1994).7

These developments since the mid‐1980s represented a sea change in the conduct of

monetary policy as central banks had previously been proudly secretive. Indeed,

central banks in the advanced world began a race to determine which one was most

transparent or could provide the clearest forward guidance. This is the so‐called

“…long march toward greater transparency…” (Blinder et. al. 2008, pg. 911) that

defines central banking since the early 1990s.8

The global financial crisis of 2007‐2009 saw a reversal in all of these developments.

Central banks were seen as less independent of government and more willing to

provide fiscal support even if only indirectly. Some also saw some advantage in

becoming more ‘artful’ and less forthcoming about their plans and policies. The days

of the monetary authority standing by unless inflation and real economic activity

showed signs of being excessively high or low quickly vanished. Central banks would

do “whatever it takes” and intervene heavily and across a wide spectrum of economic

activity.

Central bank governance has also evolved over time although, along this dimension,

there are few indications today of any momentous reversals in the offing. This is

surprising since the global financial crisis has revealed a number of flaws in the

decision‐making strategy adopted by some central banks and the reliability of their

economic outlook.


7The one notable modern exception being the European Central Bank.
8This development is reflected in indicators of central bank transparency. See Siklos (2002, 2011,
2017), and Dincer and Eichengreen (2014).

                                                                                                     10
Early in their history most central banks were dominated by a single decision‐maker.

While staff no doubt provide support to the Governor, central banking was seen as a

top‐down institution with extraordinary authority vested in the Governor. Even if

Governors largely remain primus inter pares there is now recognition and perhaps

even an expectation that decisions cannot be taken without the advice of a committee

of experts whose accountability to the government varies. Moreover, it is now de

rigueur to see central banks with technical and research support as a further

indication of the professionalization of the central banking profession (e.g., see

Adolph 2013). Paralleling this development has been the growth in the number of

academics and economists as central bankers that have increasingly replaced the

bankers and bureaucrats who originally ran most central banks. Moreover, in recent

years, there is an impression that Central Bank Governors are once again playing a

seemingly outsized role in public policy discussions. The media hangs on their every

word. Meanwhile, political pressure on central banks is also on the rise. Surprisingly

perhaps, there have been fewer indications of policy makers questioning whether

there is sufficient diversity of opinions represented in policy making committees.

Indeed, using the U.S. case as an example, the slightest indication of greater Fed

dissent attracts the immediate attention of financial markets.9 To the extent there

exists dissent it is reflected in monetary policy committee members’ economic

outlook. A recent example, of course, is the so‐called Fed ‘dot plot’.10




9 Thornton and Wheelock (2014) review the history of dissents inside the FOMC. These peaked under

Volcker and declined under Greenspan only to rise under Bernanke and Yellen’s chairmanship.
10 These are found in the projections contained in the Monetary Policy Reports of the U.S. Federal

Reserve. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.

                                                                                               11
One area of central banking that has been left untouched by fads or fashion is the

virtual elimination of a private sector ownership role in central banks. With a few

notable exceptions (e.g., Switzerland) central banks were eventually nationalized and

there is no hint that this phenomenon will ever be reversed. Indeed, whereas private

ownership was part and parcel of the oldest central banks, after World War II, the

central bank became an institution entirely within government.

At this juncture in monetary and economic history what has come to dominate the

current debate is the policy strategy of central banking. Indeed, in order to

understand where we might go from here there is a need to re‐examine the evolution

of monetary strategies since their creation in Sweden almost three and a half

centuries ago.

From about the early 1990s until around 2007 monetary policy was increasingly

viewed in narrow terms as concerned with inflation control. Prior to the most recent

era, however, there was a never ending struggle between central banks and

governments that were thought to behave in a manner captured by the famous time‐

inconsistency hypothesis of Kydland and Prescott (1977). The hypothesis suggests

that central bank independence (or ‘conservatism’ in the language of Barro and

Gordon (1983) and Rogoff (1985)) is a mechanism that can avoid inflation rising

above what is deemed socially optimal by pushing back against the desire of the

political authorities to exploit the Phillips curve trade‐off. By implication, this implies

that the central bank can protect or even enhance its reputation by committing itself

to a policy that is successful at preventing the discretion that may originate from

political pressure on the monetary authorities.


                                                                                        12
Finally, a successful monetary policy requires only a single instrument, an interest

rate, to ensure low and stable inflation. Indeed, ever since central banks became a tool

for macroeconomic stabilization, especially after World War II, until the late 1980s

and early 1990s, the strategy that consisted of aiming for adequate economic growth

while limiting inflation (captured in the famous Taylor Principle) came to dominate

the consensus about how best to conduct monetary policy. Moreover, these

developments took place in parallel with acceptance that fiscal discipline is essential

to allow the central bank to meet its objective.

The foregoing sentiments were also given credence by central bankers. As Mervyn

King, former Governor of the Bank of England, once said (King 1995): “Central banks

are often accused of being obsessed with inflation. This is untrue. If they are obsessed

with anything, it is with fiscal policy.” Although this is arguably an exaggeration it

does highlight the potential threat of fiscal dominance.

Events in recent years have not changed the consensus. Indeed, most governments

and their central banks have not changed their numerical targets at all since the 2007‐

9 global financial crisis. An outside observer would be hard‐pressed to conclude that

monetary policy changed as a result of the momentous events of the past few years.

Yet, the strategy of monetary policy has changed and many central banks now have

to balance the need to maintain financial system stability defined as preventing

imbalances, in addition to achieving an inflation objective. The resort to a multiplicity




                                                                                      13
of instruments to carry out a strategy that has yet to be made clear also suggests a

regime shift in monetary policy.11

Equally important, the turmoil in global financial markets since 2007, followed by the

admittedly slow return to a state that approaches pre‐crisis conditions, led more

central banks to invoke ‘data dependence’ as a guide to monetary policy. The problem

is that, even in the heyday of the Great Moderation, when central banks were fond of

saying that they looked at everything before setting the stance of monetary policy,

post‐crisis this was seen by some as an inability, if not unwillingness, to return to

more rule‐like behavior (e.g., see Siklos 2017).

Other than the breadth and scope of the interventions by central banks in recent

years, there is some irony in that central banks are being encouraged, implicitly or

explicitly, to adopt a strategy that defined the mandate of some of the oldest central

banks, namely a concern about preventing financial instability together with

allowances for the possibility of fiscal dominance. Finally, the continued resort to

various forms of quantitative easing (QE) type policies in systemically important

economies over an extended period of time also creates the possibility of a return of

fiscal dominance through a back door.

Unlike our pre‐crisis understanding of inflation, central bankers are not yet able to

convince the public that their forays into financial market intervention are as effective

as they have claimed or have consequences that they fully understand. Part of the

problem is that so‐called Unconventional Monetary Policies (UMP) are intended to



 We define a monetary policy strategy in terms of the goals of monetary policy. In contrast, a

monetary policy regime is characterized by the instruments used to achieve the stated strategy.

                                                                                                  14
deal with short‐term difficulties in the financial system. Not surprisingly, much of the

recent literature focuses on how QE affects asset prices. Demonstrating that UMP can

help boost economic growth, return inflation to a normal level, or even convincing the

public that output growth would have been even lower without it (a counterfactual)

is much more difficult.

No wonder then, when faced with ‘pushing on a string’, the response of central banks

is to ‘push harder’ but without a convincing reason to persist with such a strategy. A

look back at the history of central banking, however, suggests that policy makers are

attempting to define a new monetary policy strategy but one which has yet to be fully

debated let alone well understood.

Central banks, it is sometimes forgotten, are creatures of sovereign states. As a result,

while they are geared towards domestic objectives these are rarely removed from

international concerns. Obviously, the prime symbol of the transmission of

international shocks is via the exchange rate.

Other than flexible inflation targeting there have been three other monetary policy

regimes that have, in one way or another, implicitly or explicitly taken a stand on the

behavior of the exchange rate. Stated differently, declaring a policy regime aimed at

some price stability objective, especially when this is combined with other goals (e.g.,

employment, another economic or political objective), should have implications for

exchange rate behavior. Examples are the gold and the gold exchange standards, the

Bretton Woods system of pegged but adjustable exchange rates, and the European

Monetary Union which created a common currency by setting an irrevocable




                                                                                      15
exchange rate between sovereign nations. Moreover, the strategy has generally

always been the same across all regimes, namely to achieve a form of price stability.

Financial system stability was generally believed to be the collateral benefit from any

strategy that aims to keep inflation low and stable. At the risk of over‐simplification,

policy makers have always sought, but did not always succeed, in defining a monetary

policy regime that could rely on a minimum of policy instruments. One of the great

appeals of flexible inflation targeting is that a single instrument is capable of meeting

the strategic objectives of monetary policy. One only has to look at most central banks’

depictions of the monetary policy transmission mechanism prior to the global

financial crisis to get confirmation of this view.

Beyond these questions is the age‐old role of exchange rates that has also re‐emerged

as a fallout from large swings in currency values as central banks follow non‐

traditional policies and deviate from the simple rules based policies that appeared to

have worked so well during the Great Moderation (Bordo and Schenk 2016). Some

central banks have also returned to using the older tools of exchange market

intervention to short circuit the market’s view of the currency’s appropriate value.

This development is also a reflection of another perennial concern of policy makers,

namely exchange rate stability. In contrast to the attempt to return to the pegged

rates of the gold standard after World War I, the post Bretton Woods era has favored

greater exchange rate flexibility. Nevertheless, one cannot entirely dismiss the

possibility of a return to some attempt to moderate exchange rate movements

especially if inflation targeting, with its reliance on a floating exchange rate, is




                                                                                      16
threatened. Since the latest global financial crisis there are signs, so far unsuccessful,

that this movement toward formal exchange rate management could take place.12

What remains unclear is the form in which this might take place. A great deal of the

difficulty is that the trade channel of exchange rate changes differs from the financial

channel. In the former a depreciation improves the balance of trade but has negative

effects on financial flows. Complicating matters is that these channels have a different

impact depending on the sophistication of the financial system (e.g., see Kearns and

Patel 2016).

Now is a propitious time to examine whether certain kinds of economies are more

prone than others to adopting new strategies and to leave the past behind. 13

Moreover, it is also germane to ask whether certain types of events, such as a financial

crisis, are likely to push an economy to a tipping point leading to a change in the

monetary policy strategy in place.

Historically, large systemically important economies were at the forefront of creating

central banks and vesting them with the authority and tools to influence economic

outcomes. By the late 20th century, however, it was the small open economies that

were seen as relatively more innovative in developing best practices in monetary




12 Ilzetzki, Reinhart and Rogoff (2017), reprising an earlier study (Reinhart and Rogoff 2004), dispute

the view held, for example, by the International Monetary Fund, that exchange rate regimes have
typically become more flexible over the past couple of decades. Many inflation targeting economies
are said to have adopted a variant of managed floating. One can, of course, quibble with their
identification strategy. For example, Canadian officials would likely object to Canada’s regime being
labelled a managed float. Nevertheless their results remind us that policy makers scrutinize exchange
rate movements as an indicator of exchange rate management.
13 In what follows we focus on historical and economic reasons for the choice of regimes and not on

the nexus between monetary thought and the adoption or rejection of particular forms of monetary
policy. Interested readers should consult Laidler (2015), and references therein.

                                                                                                   17
policy and coherent policy strategies. We provide some suggestive supporting

evidence for this insight.

This paper also argues that, by the late 20th century, small open economies were more

prone to adopting a new policy regime when the old one no longer served its purpose

whereas large, less open, and systemically important economies were more reluctant

to embrace new approaches to monetary policy.14 Small open economies are more

flexible 15 and as trade and financial globalization have progressed over time,

especially after World War II, more aware of the importance of global shocks. In

contrast, large and systemically important countries have tended to rely on a pre‐

conceived notion that they were more immune to global influences, that is, that their

policies potentially influence the rest of the world but not the other way around. It

has taken the aftermath of the global crisis of 2007‐8 for even the Fed to begin

publicly acknowledging that global conditions do matter. Assuming, as Milton

Friedman once wrote, that in the aftermath of a crisis policy makers tend to be more

receptive to the “ideas that are lying around”16 there are at least two sets of results

that can be informative about whether and what central banks learn from each other.

First, the policy response and reforms in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Second, if

the good ideas include the demonstration effect from the experience in other




14 In our data set these economies are: Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.
15 And are, in words of Capie, Wood and Castañeda (2016), are perhaps more likely to be “high trust”
societies.
16 In the Preface to the 1982 edition (pg. xiv) of Capitalism and Freedom (2002) Milton Friedman

argued: “Only a crisis—actual or perceived—produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions
that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to
develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically
impossible becomes politically inevitable.”

                                                                                                 18
economies, then the extent to which global factors influence inflation in particular

may well be to provide another indication of the likelihood of learning from others.

The combination of a flexible exchange rate regime, a concern for ensuring a form of

price stability, and more effective prudential requirements rendered small open

economies more nimble to policy shocks from various sources. Hence, innovations in

the area of deciding when to reform an existing monetary policy regime may well

originate in small open economies.17

A significant challenge in explaining the evolution of central banks across several

economies lies in part with limitations on the scope and availability of data over a

long span of time combined with what appear to be frequent breaks or interruptions

in the conduct of monetary policy. Accordingly, this paper combines a narrative

approach with some empirical evidence that is intended to support some of the claims

being made. While the empirical evidence may not be definitive it does point in the

direction of clear connections across economies in the policy regimes adopted over

time. Our work is also assisted by the recent empirical macroeconomic literature that

has led to the view that a few common factors can explain the bulk of the variance of

macroeconomic data. If this is the case then there is considerable useful information

in cross‐country estimates of the drivers of inflation and economic growth.

As we shall see below, we can also potentially exploit correlations among cross

sectional units to consider a series of counterfactuals. Several central banks have



17There are, of course, some exceptions such as the UK, an early adopter of many innovations in the
conduct of monetary policy that persist to this day. Similarly, in other important cases, such as in
Europe, politics overwhelms economics leaving the tension between the desire to have a common
currency while relying on monetary policy to deliver economic outcomes its members aspire to, largely
unresolved. See, for example, James (2012).

                                                                                                 19
existed for a long time although, in historical terms, the institution is comparatively

young. Hence, one way to ascertain their influence is to ask ‘what if ’ kinds of

questions to better understand their economic impact as policy regimes and

strategies have evolved over time.

One asks whether countries that did not have a central bank while others did would

have ended up with better macroeconomic performance had they created a central

bank earlier. Relying on panel data since at least 1870, or before, for at least 10

economies we can generate hypothetical estimates of inflation and real GDP growth

under a counterfactual scenario such as the one just described. Until the 1990s, major

changes in policy regimes were often adopted more or less simultaneously by several

countries. However, regimes often ended as a result of examples from the smaller

economies. It is, therefore, worth asking whether the data are suggestive of a learning

mechanism whereby a change in the policy regime originates first from smaller, more

open economies instead of from the dominant economies in the international

monetary system.

   3. Policy Regimes in Historical Perspective

Convenience dictates that exchange rate regimes should be sub‐divided into the fixed

or floating varieties. Of course, fixed exchange rates regimes come in different guises

while floating rate regimes are ill defined unless an anchor for policy is chosen. In the

case of fixed exchange rates we have seen the Gold Standard, through Bretton Woods,

followed by the limited exchange rate systems that eventually gave birth to the

European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and, finally, a monetary union of the kind




                                                                                      20
that resulted in the creation of the euro. Floating regimes have generally targeted

either a monetary aggregate or, in recent decades, inflation.

Since central banks represent one of the most potent symbols of sovereignty their

ability to respond to both domestic and foreign shocks is an appropriate way to think

about policy regimes. Clearly, how the exchange rate regime is understood is one way

to identify how the balance between these two shocks defines the regime in place.

All told it is fair to say that the world economy has seen five major monetary policy

regimes adopted over the past two centuries.18 They are: the Gold and Gold Exchange

standards of pre‐World War II. Then, shortly after the Second World War ended, the

Bretton Woods system was put in place though it took several years to fully take

effect. Like its pre‐war counterpart the regime remained anchored to the notion that

exchange rate fluctuations should be limited. For a policy regime that has been

outlived by all the other major monetary arrangements, save one, it is surprising how

the Bretton Woods arrangement continues to appeal to the imagination of some

policy makers. Perhaps, as Dooley et. al. (2009) have argued, it is because the system

survived in a different form after its presumed collapse in the early 1970s.

Alternatively, as the global financial crisis reached its peak in 2008 and 2009, there

were calls from many quarters for a ‘new Bretton Woods’, culminating with the

London Summit of the G20 leaders.19

Once Bretton Woods ended, the search for an anchor of monetary policy led, in quick

succession, to variants of the Bretton Woods system, chiefly in Europe. It also led to


18Six regimes if we add the creation of central banks. See below.
19The desire for a new Bretton Woods was, like the aim for a monetary union in Europe, more
enthusiastically supported by politicians than academic economists.

                                                                                        21
the adoption of money growth targeting in a number of countries. The money growth

targeting regime survived for less time than did Bretton Woods. In the case of Europe

the volatile transition from the end of the Bretton Woods System and the pegged

exchange rate systems of the 1970s and 1980s hastened the adoption of a common

currency (the euro) and a common central bank (the ECB) among several sovereign

states, a monetary regime that had never before in history been implemented in this

manner. Yet, the drive to create a single currency in Europe was primarily driven by

political motives. Hence, while politics eventually enabled the creation of the euro it

also left the enterprise bereft of the necessary institutional structures and policy

instruments necessary for its long‐term survival which, as this is written, may be in

doubt (e.g., see James 2012, Sinn 2014, Brunnermeier, James and Landau 2016).

Nevertheless, this regime has so far still managed to outlive Bretton Woods.

While loose forms of exchange rate targeting persisted in various parts of the world

it is the spread of inflation targeting that came to define the last two or three decades

of monetary history. Indeed, on the eve of the global financial crisis, 10 advanced

economies had adopted an explicit numerical inflation target (IT) as well as 23

emerging market economies. Four other economies (i.e., the US, the Eurozone,

Switzerland, and Japan), although unwilling to acknowledge the IT label, do formally

recognize the need to aim for some inflation objective and have made public a

numerical value associated with some notion of price stability (e.g., see Siklos 2017).

Two other striking features about the foregoing brief history of policy regimes are

worth noting. First, it is often the case that the transition from one type of regime to

another, regardless of the type, has not always been a smooth one. The end of the Gold


                                                                                      22
Standard during the interwar era and the Great Inflation that spelled the end of

Bretton Woods immediately come to mind. Second, whereas there was less of a

tendency for different policy regimes to overlap each other before World War II,

following Bretton Woods there is seemingly more overlap in the adoption date of

policy regimes ranging from inflation targeting to the most binding form of a fixed

exchange rate regime, namely the Eurozone single currency area. Nevertheless, with

the exception of the UK, the adoption of IT is largely driven by small open economies

while the larger, more systemically important economies have either resisted

embracing the IT moniker or eschewed the label entirely. Table 2 provides a summary

chronology of the principal monetary regimes since central banks examined in our

sample were created.

If we focus on inflation performance only the Gold Standard always delivers the

lowest mean inflation rate followed by inflation targeting in those countries where it

was adopted. Note, however, that inflation volatility is relatively higher than in any of

the other policy regimes considered. Where IT is not adopted the period since the

euro enters into circulation provides the next best inflation outcome.20 In contrast,

Bretton Woods always delivers the highest rate of economic growth. No wonder then

that some of the G20 leaders at the 2008 Washington summit summoned the memory

of Bretton Woods (Winnett 2008). The Gold Standard comes in second place

everywhere except for the UK, France and Norway. Similarly, the relatively brief era




20Except for France where ERM has a trivially lower average inflation rate (1.52% versus 1.54%
during ERM).

                                                                                                 23
of monetary targeting often performed worse than the other policy regimes other

than for the UK.

Comparisons such as these are hazardous for several reasons. First, performance in a

particular era reflect a delay in problems that only emerge in the next era. Second,

economic growth performance cannot entirely be associated with the monetary

policy regime in place. Structural factors, often slow moving, emerge in the aftermath

of wars or technological developments that are independent of the monetary policy

in place. Finally, Stock and Watson (2004) noted some time ago that inflation

performance during the Great Moderation reflected a healthy dose of ‘good luck’ and

not ‘good policy’. The former was facilitated by relatively small shocks to the US

economy. The same type of phenomenon may well have explained inflation

performance elsewhere.

The recent financial crisis, however, has also reminded policy makers about another

important distinction that has the potential of shifting the singular focus on the role

of the exchange rate regime which has dominated the discourse about the influence

of monetary policy regimes throughout history at least until 2008. The events of the

past eight years have led to a rediscovery of the critical distinction between shocks

that originate from the real and financial sectors of the economy. The

interdependence referred to above, ostensibly guaranteed by a pure float, can be

upended when financial flows enter the picture. In particular, the subsequent global

impact of the financial shock that originated in the US in 2007 transcended how

existing exchange rate regimes operated. Indeed, the highly synchronized downturn




                                                                                    24
in economic activity and inflation was felt around the world irrespective of how

flexible exchange rate regimes were.21

Instead, it was a coherent policy strategy which included commitment to an inflation

objective at its core, a resilient and effective financial regulatory regime, together

with the flexibility and willingness to use the available fiscal space, that proved to be

the defining characteristic of economies that suffered relatively less economically,

especially during the worst moments of the global and subsequent Eurozone

sovereign debt crises in 2008 to 2010. Another important factor in the success of

these countries was the financial structure and regulatory oversight. Before the crisis,

Canada, Australia and New Zealand had nationwide universal banks and one

regulator in contrast to the U.S. Of course, these countries were not global financial

centers unlike the UK which had a similar banking and regulatory structure (see

Bordo, Redish, and Rockoff 2015). Finally, given the preference in some economies

for a policy strategy that includes less than perfect exchange rate flexibility, a

preference for anchoring expectations to an inflation objective proves relatively more

important than the de facto exchange rate regime in place, especially in some

emerging market economies. Indeed, IT regimes have been sufficiently successful at

anchoring inflation expectations to the target that, years after the GFC, below target

inflation rates are raising questions about whether central banks have become

complacent leading to calls to raise the inflation target substantially (e.g., see Ball


21 Rey (2015), for example, is another study that emphasizes the importance of a global financial cycle

since the 1990s, that is, a reflection of the monetary policy of a dominant or ‘centre country’ (viz., the
US). This has the implication of reducing the trilemma conditions for an independent monetary policy,
where a floating exchange rate plays a critical role, to a dilemma. Hence, capital account management
is necessary to preserve policy independence. Aizenman, Chinn and Ito (2016) conclude, however,
that the trilemma is alive and well, at least in emerging market economies.

                                                                                                      25
2014, and references therein). It seems that proponents of higher inflation want

fewer opportunities to hit the ZLB which can create problems for central banks in

search of still looser policies. But those who favor a tactic of raising inflation targets

cannot provide a convincing argument that higher inflation will also improve

aggregate economic performance. Estimating a threshold beyond which inflation

produces a deterioration in economic growth has proved elusive (e.g., Bruno and

Easterly 1998, Vaona 2012) Instead, the essence of their argument is that central

banks must want to avoid the ZLB and negative interest rates as much as possible

even though there is little evidence that these developments have proved difficult for

central banks to implement

4. Methodological Approaches

The preceding section suggests that evaluating the impact of central banks

throughout history is full of challenges requiring the interested observer to ask

several ‘what if’ questions. Even under ideal circumstances engaging in

counterfactuals is difficult. For example, we ask what aggregate economic activity

would look like if an institution expected to intervene in the economy to meet a

particular objective, or set of objectives, did not exist. However, as noted above,

central banks are a pervasive feature of the economic landscape for a century or more.

We have very few examples, or the necessary data, to evaluate what might happen if

the monetary authority did not exist. Additionally, monetary history teaches us that

it is difficult to neatly separate policy regimes from other events that are very likely

to also have macroeconomic effects. To illustrate, it can be hazardous to contemplate

what inflation and real economic growth might have been if a central bank had been


                                                                                       26
created earlier especially during an era when rules such as the Gold Standard were in

place. Two reasons immediately come to mind. First, central banks under the Gold

Standard were less interventionist than today’s monetary authorities. Second, the

Gold Standard is squarely focused on price level developments not inflation per se.

Nevertheless, depending on the statistical properties of the price level one may still

be able to explore central bank performance in terms of inflation.22

Nevertheless, there is considerable value in conducting counterfactual experiments if

only to get an impression of some of the potential impacts of institutional changes

such as the creation of a central bank. In part this is because rules are rarely followed

exactly as intended. This is especially true when these institutions must also consider

the international environment in which the rules are intended to be applied.

Counterfactuals, while useful, cannot entirely replace inference based on the

observed behavior of time series. Accordingly, we also perform a set of econometric

tests to help us understand not only when central bank policies may have changed

but also the extent to which these changes are transmitted from one country to

another over time.

        4.1 Breaks, Gaps and Their significance: Combining History and Econometrics

From a practical perspective the choice of a monetary policy regime is likely the result

of a shift in the behavior of one or more key economic performance indicators. Of

course, a regime change may also create additional forces that may also produce




22“Under the Gold Standard the price level has a stochastic trend because real shocks to the demand
and supply of gold caused changes in the money supply and, over the long‐term, the price level.” (Bordo
and Schwartz 1999). The stochastic trend nature of price movements implies that the stationary
component of prices can be expressed in first differences of the (log) of prices.

                                                                                                   27
changes in one or more of these indicators. For example, one can imagine that the

creation of a central bank, the abandonment of one exchange rate regime and the

adoption of another or even an explicit commitment to achieving a form of price

stability, at least statistically, is identified by a structural break. Given the particular

importance of inflation in assessing central bank performance, an obvious choice then

is to focus on the behavior of this variable. Output growth is another equally valid

candidate for analysis. After all, an ostensible reason for inflation control is to create

an environment for mitigating business cycle fluctuations, at least when interpreted

through the prism of modern macroeconomic thought.

Whereas monetary policy was geared towards inflation control post‐World War II,

the Gold and Gold Exchange standards involved strategies that focus on achieving a

form of price level stability by maintaining gold convertibility through the setting of

the fixed nominal price of gold. In more modern parlance, the price of gold served as

the instrument that translated into achieving price level stability.

There exist, of course, several statistical time series based tests for structural breaks.

Since the countries in our data set may well have undergone more than one regime

shift it is natural to consider first a test that allows for multiple structural breaks. The

Bai and Perron (1998) test is likely the best known test under the circumstances and

we also adopt it here. It has the advantage that it is model based as opposed to the

standard univariate approaches to testing for breaks. Of course, if the model is mis‐

specified the advantage disappears.

All structural break tests, and many have been proposed, have their drawbacks (e.g.,

see Perron 2005). For example, Perron (1989) pointed out that the behavior of US


                                                                                         28
real GDP is best described as a trend stationary process with a structural break

around the time of the Great Depression but that the result is partly dependent on the

choice of the year of the break. As a result, unit root testing from structural break

testing cannot be easily separated. Moreover, one must also consider the possibility

that the break is akin to a one time shock or can occur gradually.23

A retrospective historical analysis may well have led to selecting a year that differs

from the statistical testing. It is precisely differences between these two

methodologies that require further analysis. 24 Moreover, as we shall see below, a

narrative approach often leads to a range of years over which a break takes place as

opposed to a single year. And when a gradual change is allowed the statistical

procedure leaves little choice but to adopt a somewhat ad hoc function or model to

capture such changes. History can provide more flexible timing for breaks but this

does not mean that there is unanimity in pinpointing, for example, when financial

crises take place and for how long.25

In one set of calculations, we assume that before the creation of the US Federal

Reserve the Bank of England serves as the benchmark for global price stability. After

1913 the Federal Reserve is then assumed to serve as the standard sought by the



23 An innovation (innovation outlier, or IO) model which assumes that the break occurs gradually, with
the breaks following the same dynamic path as the innovations, while the additive model (or additive
outlier, AO) model assumes the breaks occur immediately.
24 There is occasionally the tendency to ignore history and rely instead on statistical testing alone. This

ignores that the specification of the null and alternative hypotheses, not to mention the power of
available test, invites caution in relying too heavily on this kind of strategy. Similarly, historical
analyses are also subject to selectivity bias. Presenting both forms of evidence at least has the
advantage of prompting the researcher to look for some explanation for any discrepancy between the
timing adopted by historians and the one generated via econometric means
25 An illustration is the Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) dating of various types of financial crises. Bordo

and Meissner (2016) find fault with some of the banking and currency crises identified by Reinhart
and Rogoff. In what follows we adopt the Bordo and Meissner (2016) chronology.

                                                                                                       29
economies in our sample. The two are chosen because of the systemic importance of

both economies. Clearly, other benchmarks are possible see below). A difficulty here

is that, under the traditional Gold Standard and successive regimes tied to gold, the

instrument of policy, as previously noted, translates into a regime geared toward the

maintenance of price level stability. Once the Gold Standard ended in the middle of

the twentieth century the objective of policy evolved into a focus on inflation

performance. In what follows the discussion is in terms of inflation performance

strictly for convenience. For the Gold Standard era we derive the estimates of interest

in terms of the price level (or, rather, the log of the price level) and then take the rate

of change to ensure comparability with the post‐Gold Standard era.26

where     is inflation and B is inflation in the benchmark economy. Each economy is
indexed by i at time t. Notice that the benchmark economies are, by modern

standards, large systemically important economies. If smaller, more open, economies

adopt similar regimes over time and, as a result, deliver comparable inflation rates

then d in equation (1) is expected to be stationary. If, however, stationarity is rejected

then so is convergence of sorts between economy i and the benchmark economy. A

possibility then is that adopting a new monetary regime is conditioned on the

development, persistence, and size of any gap in inflation performance between




26For the Gold Standard (and related regimes) period we also present and provide cross‐country
comparisons in terms of the price level. Not all results are presented below.

                                                                                           30
economy i and the benchmark economy in question. 27 In other words, we treat

equation (1) as serving as a proxy for the level of dissatisfaction with the existing

policy strategy. 28 Dissatisfaction with the preferred or best performing existing

international strategy may reflect a domestic failure to follow best practice in

monetary policy. Alternatively, if the benchmark economy no longer serves as the

lodestar for how to conduct monetary policy then the source of unhappiness with the

current regime lies with the economy that is seen as the standard for others to follow.

As note above, other benchmarks are contemplated. For example, if the 10 central

banks in our study can, in fact, be treated as a global network of central banks that

learn from each other then perhaps an international measure of inflation is a more

suitable benchmark. 29 Unfortunately, no universally accepted measure of global

inflation exists. Therefore, we construct three proxies. The simplest is an arithmetic

average across the 10 economies in our data set. Next, we extract the first principal

component in a factor model of inflation, again including data from all 10 countries in

the sample.30 Finally, many researchers extract a trend or equilibrium measure of a

time series by applying the Hodrick‐Prescott (H‐P) filter. Hamilton (2017) not only

reminds us of the drawbacks and distortions induced by this filter but recommends a




27 A similar argument can be made in terms of another key economic indicator such as real GDP
growth. Arguably, economic development is influenced by structural factors that are not easily
quantified. Hence, for reasons already stated, we prefer to focus on inflation performance.
28 For the benchmark economies the level of unhappiness with the existing regime would be its own

historical experience for one or more key economic indicator or continued discrepancies vis‐à‐vis
expectations for the particular economic indicator in question. This brings up the question of
credibility in monetary policy. See Bordo and Siklos (2016) for an historical examination relying on a
similar data set as the one used in the present study. The current study is more comparative in nature.
29 Alternatively, the real price of gold is also a suitable benchmark.
30 Again, in the Gold Standard era, we can examine these same relationships in terms of the (log) of the

price level although the conclusions did not change.

                                                                                                    31
simple new alternative. In what follows we implement Hamilton’s replacement for

the H‐P filter to proxy for πtB in equation (1).

           4.2 Counterfactuals

At the simplest level counterfactuals are an attempt to answer ‘what if’ kinds of

questions. As a result, quantitative methods to obtain counterfactual results are

varied. In what follows, we apply Hsiao et. al.’s (2012) method.

To illustrate their methodology consider the following four central banks. They are,

in order of the dating of their creation (years in parenthesis; see Table 1): the Bank of

Italy (1893), the Swiss National Bank (1907), the US Federal Reserve (1913), and the

Bank of Canada (1934). Ideally, we would like some data when these institutions did

not exist in order to determine what macroeconomic performance would have been

like if a central bank had been created earlier. The treatment or intervention then

refers to the year when a central bank is created.

Next, consider Figure 1. The plot shows when central banks were created relative to

when these economies became nation or sovereign states in the modern sense of the

word. 31 A positive bar means that the central bank came into existence before

statehood or independence while a negative bar indicates how many years it took

once statehood was achieved until the monetary authority to be created. The central

banks that are identified by the vertical dashed lines are the subject of the empirical

analysis. The choices are dictated by data availability and quality over a long time

span. Details are left to the following section.




31   The traditional definition relies on a date of independence or the introduction of a Constitution.

                                                                                                          32
Almost half the central banks in our sample were in existence before statehood. As

discussed above they were, at least for a time, banks of issue and their functions

would evolve over time. However, statehood generally comes first followed by the

creation of a central bank. Indeed, in many cases, the gap between the two events is

small, a reflection of the almost symbiotic link between the concepts of sovereignty

and central banking.

Figure 2 plots the number of central banks created since the Riksbank, the world’s

first central bank, opened its doors in 1668. It is seen that central banks are largely a

creature of the 20th century. Indeed, the pace of central bank creation speeds up after

the 1950s. Hence, central banks are comparatively young institutions. However,

because so many central banks came into existence after World War II, when data

availability increases dramatically, the experimental way of conducting a

counterfactual experiment is simply not available or practical in the present context.

Therefore, an alternative approach is required and this is where a long span of

historical data is especially helpful.

Returning to the four central banks in our example, we have a substantial amount of

data about how economies performed in several economies when monetary

authorities did not exist in Italy, Switzerland, the US and Canada. While data

availability is adequate statistical challenges remain, as we shall see.

The approach proposed and implemented by Hsiao et. al. (2012) exploits information

in a cross‐section of data. Hsiao et. al. (2012) ask what economic growth in Hong Kong

would have been if sovereignty had not changed hands from the British to China in




                                                                                      33
July 1997. 32 The basic premise of the counterfactual is that there exist common

factors that drive economic variables of interest whether or not there is some

treatment or intervention. In the present context, once a central bank is created there

is the presumption that an institution is created that has some discretion. Granted the

scope of that discretion will be limited by the exchange rate regime in place, the remit

given to the institution, its autonomy from government influence, to name three

important factors. Similarly, there is not quite a comparable institutional mechanism

that is able to fully take the place of the central bank.33 Yet, economic performance,

as summarized, say, by the price level, inflation and output growth performance, in

two countries respectively with or without central banks will still respond to some

common factors.34

Therefore, we can use information in the cross‐section of inflation and real economic

growth performance in countries that had a central bank to ask how these two

variables would have behaved had a central bank been created in a country that did

not have a monetary authority over the same period.




32 They also ask what economic performance would have been if the 2003 economic partnership
agreement with mainland China had not been signed.
33 Before the creation of central banks there were, however, alternative institutional mechanisms that

effectively played some of the role later assigned to a central bank (e.g., as the US Treasury did in the
case of financial crises in the National banking era when it shifted deposits from the Independent
Treasury to key commercial banks or the role of clearing houses in issuing emergency currency
(Timberlake 1984. Gorton 1984). Also in the case of some dominant nationwide commercial banks in
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In some cases, the government would also intervene from time to
time in a manner reminiscent of what central banks would later do (e.g., as in the Finance Act of 1914
in Canada; see Siklos 2006).
34 Productivity, demographics, geographical location, even historical events may link these economies

even if they adopt different institutional frameworks. As we shall see, statistically speaking, the details
of the common drivers of economic performance are less critical than the mere fact that some of these
common factors are believed to exist.

                                                                                                       34
More formally, suppose we observe a time series for country i, at time t, denoted yitN

for the case where there is no central bank. The counterfactual assumes that there

exist (common) factors that explain y. Hence, we can write

                             yitN   i  β i* Ft   it , i  1,..., N ; t  1,...T                 (2)

where β * is a vector of coefficients that is constant over time but varies across the i

cross‐sections, F are the K common factors that vary over time, and                     is a residual
that represents the random idiosyncratic component for i, such that E( it )  0 . It is

assumed, among other things, that the idiosyncratic components are uncorrelated

across i. Therefore, E (ε t Ft' )  0 .35

Next, denote yitCB as the time series of interest when a central bank is in place.

Therefore, the expression

                                              it  y itCB  y itN                                   (3)

is the treatment effect of i at time t. Since, in our example, we don’t observe the right

hand side variables simultaneously, the observed data can be thought as being

expressed in the linear combination form

                                        1, if i is under treatment at time t
yit  it yitCB  (1   ) yitN , it                                                        (4)
                                         0,             otherwise

Under the various assumptions made by Hsiao et. al. (2012) y1Nt can be predicted

from yˆ 1Nt obtained from estimating (4). With i=1, and the remaining i assumed to be




35There are other assumptions that are less critical for the discussion that follows but should be borne
in mind. See, however, Hsiao et. al. (2012, p. 707).

                                                                                                     35
unaffected in the presence of intervention,36 the foregoing expressions suggest that

we can estimate what the price level, inflation or real GDP growth would have been

in Italy, Switzerland, Canada, or the US, each of the i=1 in the above illustration, using

data from the countries where central banks were already in existence. The only

additional piece of information required is knowledge of T#, that is, the year when the

central     bank     is    created.     From       T#    until    the     data     ends     (i.e.,   T)

y t  y tN , t  1,...,T # ,T # 1 ,...,T . In other words, we observe a central bank in all

economies examined. Hsiao et. al. (2012) also show that one can fit time series models

to 1t (e.g., AR type specifications) to determine the evolution of the treatment effect

over time and in the long‐run.

For the illustration considered so far the empirical strategy based on the

counterfactuals proposed by Hisaio et. al. (2012) imply that, in the case of the US, we

can use data from all available countries before T# =1913, with the exception of

Canada which did not have a central bank at the time. Similarly, in the case of the

Swiss national bank, we can use all available data except for US and Canadian data

since a monetary authority did not exist in these countries at T#=1907. And so on for

other available cases, assuming we have sufficient data (see below).

One potential criticism is that if the size of the other economies used to generate the

counterfactuals is too large or too small then estimates might be biased. This can be

taken into consideration by adding a weight for the relative size of each economy in


36In the case of the Hsiao et. al. (2012) application, Hong Kong may well have been affected by the
change in sovereignty but the comparator economies (e.g., neighbour economies with similar
economic characteristics; see Hsiao et. al. (2012, p. 717‐8) would not be similarly affected. In the
present context, the creation of the US Fed may have affected US economic activity but it is less likely
that these same variables would be impacted in the countries that already had central banks.

                                                                                                     36
question. The difficulty is that if these weights change over time such an adjustment

is ad hoc. We do not pursue this extension. Similarly, if location is thought to matter

then, in principle, equation (2) could be expanded to include regional dummies (e.g.,

Europe vs North America).37

A more significant drawback perhaps is that for at least 6 economies in our data set

(see the next section) we cannot ask what would have happened if a central bank

existed because, with the exception of a few series, we have insufficient data.

Finally, we can use the Hsiao et. al. (2012) to determine what would have happened

if, for example, targeting had not been adopted. Other counterfactuals can be

imagined but the combination of data limitations and significant changes in economic

structure in the economies considered here limit their usefulness. We briefly return

to this issue later.

        4.3 The Determinants of Inflation Differentials

The specification of equation (1) implies that, in a cross‐section setting, there are

likely economic and institutional determinants of inflation (or price level)

differentials across countries (and time). In the case of institutional determinants our

narratives suggest that a financial crisis, either of the global or banking varieties

especially, are likely critical determinants of these differentials and, hence, might spur

the adoption of a different monetary policy strategy. Other candidates include the




37Hsiao et. al. (2012) examine the statistical benefits of relying on the factor model approach to
generating the counterfactual series (i.e., equation (2)) and find a significant deterioration relative to
the simplest case of, say, relying only on growth rates in countries with no treatment to estimate what
would have happened in the treatment economy (i.e., Hong Kong in their example). In the estimates
presented below we report results using the simpler approach since, empirically at least, the
performance of equation (2) was superior.

                                                                                                      37
potential for fiscal dominance via the debt to GDP ratio.38 We provide a variety of

estimates of the following panel type regression written as:

                            d itj  θi j  λtj  x'it β j  εitj      (5)

where equation (5) is a standard fixed effects model (country and time effects, if

necessary) with x capturing the economic and crisis determinants of d. The index j is

added to recognize that a variety of benchmarks were considered. 39

        4.4 A Network of Central Banks?

Billio et. al. (2012) have proposed a measure of ‘connectedness’ based on principal

components analysis and Granger‐causality. If the performance of central banks,

measured in terms of the price level (prior to World War II), inflation, or real

economic growth, is more similar then this should be reflected in the number of

orthogonal factors and their explanatory power. Define N as the total number of

principal components in the 10 country data set used in this study. If central banks

are highly interconnected then this should be reflected as a small number, n, of

principal components that can explain most of the variation in the system of central

banks considered.

Alternatively, causality testing provides an indication whether a particular time

series j “Granger‐causes” (G.C.) a time series i of past values of j contain information




38 A World War or a major political conflict could be other candidate variables. These can sometimes

represent harbingers of economic changes (e.g., following World War I the Gold Exchange standard
was introduced; Bretton Woods can be traced as a fallout from World War II). Hence, it is difficult to
identify these events as separate from other economic forces that produce regime changes.
39 We specify (5) in terms of inflation for simplicity. In so doing we convert the price level data to

inflation during the Gold Standard period even if some of the tests described above are evaluated in
terms of the (log) level of prices. This complication does not affect the real economic growth
specification.

                                                                                                  38
that help predict i. The test can be carried out in a bivariate or multivariate (i.e., as in

a vector autoregression) settings. For example, continuing with equation (1) which

measures the inflation differential vis‐à‐vis a particular benchmark in the bivariate

setting, a Granger‐causality test between ditj and dktj with i≠k, would be carried out

by estimating the following two regressions, namely

                 d itj 1  a j d itj  bikj d ktj  eitj 1
                                                                                   (6)
                 d ktj 1  a j d ktj  bkij d itj  ektj 1

where a rejection of the null hypothesis that bik  0 implies that k Granger‐causes i.

We can augment equation (6) with other determinants to allow for the possibility that

there are additional factors, such as the type of exchange rate regime, or the incidence

of financial crises, to give two examples that can influence the Granger‐causality test

which have no direct association with the notion that central banks learn from each

other. Billio et. al. (2012) propose an indicator of connectedness they call the ‘degree

of Granger‐causality’ (DGC) defined as follows

                                                            N
                                                    1
                                  DGC                    
                                               N ( N  1) i 1 k  i
                                                                     (k  i) (7)


where k  i signifies that k G.C. i. A value of DGC that exceeds a certain threshold

indicates a systemic relationship between the various measures of d.

   4. Data and Empirical Evidence

               4.1 Data

Annual data, originally collected for 10 economies until 2008 by Bordo and Siklos

(2016), were updated where possible to 2015. The data used in their study represent

the accumulation of data collected and disseminated over the years by many scholars,

                                                                                         39
including Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), Bordo and Landon Lane (2013), and Schularik

and Taylor (2009), with additional historical data from some individual central banks

(viz., Norway, Sweden, USA) who have made available historical data covering a long

span of time.40

Other original sources that were used to construct the series used in Bordo and Siklos

(2016) are found at the NBER (http://www.nber.org/data/). Global financial data,

and Historical Financial Statistics of the Center for Financial Stability

(http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/hfs.php), are other data sources where

some of the series used in this study can be found.

The 10 economies examined are: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway,

Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. An appendix

provides the list of available time series and the samples over which they are

available. Additional data were collected from various issues of the Central Bank

Directory (Central Banking Publications), Siklos (2002, 2017). A file containing a list

of original sources and the sources of updates to the Bordo and Sikos (2016) data is

available.

        4.2 Empirical Results

Figures 3 and 4 plot inflation rates, where sufficient data are available, around the

time of regime changes identified by our historical narratives. Inflation five years

before and after the creation of 8 of the 10 central banks in the data set is shown.



40 Many of the links are provided in Bordo and Siklos (2016). Our data set also overlaps the recently
published Jordà‐Schularik and Taylor data set (JST; http://www.macrohistory.net/) which was also
partially constructed based on some of the earlier work of, for example, Bordo and Jonung(1995)). One
slight difference between their dataset and ours is the Canadian price level. We use data since 1910,
not 1870, to maintain consistency in the measurement of the price level. JST have data since 1870.

                                                                                                 40
Figure 3, for example, shows that it is unlikely that the prime motivating factor to

create a central bank in Sweden or the UK was a desire to control inflation. Indeed,

history clearly shows there were other factors at play. The same appears true for all

the other cases shown with the exception of Norway where inflation becomes far less

volatile after the Norges Bank opened for business in 1816. Indeed, the volatility in

inflation is related to the fact that, in most instances, the Gold Standard was in place.

Hence, the focus was on the behavior of the price level and not inflation.

The top portion of Figure 4 highlights the evolution of inflation in all 10 countries in

our data set around the time of the break‐down of Bretton Woods. Whereas inflation

differentials were fairly small by the mid‐1960s a divergence began to emerge as we

approach the decade of the 1970s. The ‘unanchoring’ or drift in inflation that emerges

following the end of Bretton Woods, underscored perhaps by the Smithsonian

agreement of 1971, produced the great divergence in inflation rates exacerbated by

the two oil price shocks of the 1970s.

The bottom portion of Figure 4 reveals that differences in inflation rates persisted for

some time as countries sought, and then failed, to find a reliable anchor for monetary

policy. By the early 1990s, however, several of the small open economies in our

sample, and the UK, adopted explicit inflation targeting. Nevertheless, all central

banks, in their own fashion, placed a much higher premium on inflation control.

Hence, by the mid‐1990s we began to see a return to much smaller inflation

differentials. Indeed, the convergence in inflation rates would intensify throughout

the second half of the decade of the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium

(not shown).


                                                                                      41
Tables 3 and 4 provide some summary statistics for some of the key series used in the

descriptive and econometric analyses. It is immediately apparent that the choice of

the benchmark has an impact on inflation and real GDP growth performance. It is

generally the case, however, that small open economies in our data set (i.e., Canada

and Sweden) perform relatively well regardless of the metric employed while a few

others, notably Italy and France, consistently under‐perform. Also note that inflation

is not noticeably affected by the exclusion of financial crises but only when the UK

and the US serve as the benchmark. Otherwise, there is a much more noticeable

impact. In contrast, real GDP growth differentials are strongly affected by the

exclusion of years when there is a GFC. Indeed, the asymmetry in inflation versus

output growth performance is striking. This has some bearing on notions of how

much central banks ought to concern themselves with real economic performance or

the strength of any link between inflation and real growth.

We can obtain a few more insights about the data by looking at Figures 5 and 6. Figure

5 displays proxies for dit as defined in equation (1). It is immediately clear that the

choice of benchmarks impacts the time properties of the data. Nevertheless, there are

some common features both pre and post‐World War II. 41 For example, the Great

Inflation of the 1970s is apparent across all proxies. Similarly, the great deflation of

the early 1920s and the Great Depression also generally show up in all variants of dit

as does the rise in inflation immediately after World War II. Note that parts A and B

of Figure 5 are, unless otherwise noted, cross‐sectional averages.



41   The sub‐samples were partly chosen to facilitate visual comparisons across filters and across time.

                                                                                                     42
Parts C and D of Figure 5 displays the behavior of deviations in the price level or a

normalized indicator of the price level covering the Gold Standard period. Deviations

from the equilibrium price level, as proxied by Hamilton’s (2017) filter are stationary,

as noted earlier (also see table 6). The contrast between the deviation form and the

original (log) levels of the series are shown in part D, for comparison.

Figure 6 plots the deviations in domestic inflation from the global mean.42 Although

inflation is generally stationary the plots reveal sharp departures, often around the

time of financial crises of the global variety (highlighted by the shaded areas in the

figure. Note that, from this perspective, the GFC of 2008‐9 pales in comparison with

earlier GFCs. Volatility across the 10 economies also varies greatly. This may well

have implications for understanding the dynamics of inflation from a cross‐sectional

standpoint (see below).

Next, we turn to some comparisons between the narrative and statistical approaches

to dating crises. Tables 5 and 6 present a selection of results while Table 7 provides a

general summary. Table 5 distinguishes between financial crises that have been

deemed global in nature, according to Bordo and Landon Lane (2010), while the last

two columns rely on the country‐specific chronology from Bordo and Meissner

(2016). In addition, the Table identifies the joint occurrence of banking and currency

crises.

If crises are associated with a break in the time series properties of the data then

Table 6 provides some indications of when these were most likely to occur. The

manner in which the tests were applied is such that the first date shown represents


42   That is, the arithmetic mean for all ten countries in the data set.

                                                                                     43
the most likely occurrence of a statistical break in the time series in question. The last

date then represents the least likely timing of a break. Interestingly, the most recent

GFC is often, though not always, one of the least likely sources of a break, at least in

the time series property of inflation. 43 Similarly, the most prominent location of

breaks in the data often take place before World War II. The rank of breaks post World

War II is often fairly low. Of course, this is only indicative of the possibility that

developments in central banking contributed to this outcome since other factors were

also clearly at play (see below).

Table 7 provides some overall perspective on the importance of financial crises based

on both the narrative and statistical approaches. The small open economies in the

sample do comparatively well across the various indicators of crisis conditions,

especially Norway and Switzerland (e.g., see column (3)). Although this result does

not exclusively reflect the quality of monetary policy in these economies it is likely

one of the factors at play in explaining the relatively small number of statistical breaks

found in the behavior of inflation. Most of the breaks in the small open economies are

observed before World War II.

The extent to which global financial crises, based on the narrative approach, dominate

the landscape of crises in the individual countries sampled varies of course. GFCs are

least frequent in Switzerland (2 of 7 crises identified) while half, or a slightly higher

proportion of the total, accounts for crises in 4 of the 10 economies examined (US,

Germany, Norway, and Sweden). There is also considerable variation in the fraction

                                                                                               44
of crises that exceed a year in duration. It is also notable that there are differences in

the degree of agreement between the statistical and narrative dating of financial

crises. It is somewhat reassuring that, other than perhaps Switzerland, the overlap

between the quantitative and narrative interpretations of history is not small.

Nevertheless, the results also suggest that both approaches are essential for a proper

understanding of the determinants of financial crises and the potential role of the

central bank to which we now turn.

Tables 8 through 10 present a selection of panel regressions that seek to quantify the

importance of some determinants of inflation in the 10 economies in the sample.

Although the results are, broadly speaking, robust across the various filters applied

to the data, the most consistently reliable results, across various specifications and

samples, were obtained when Hamilton’s filter or global inflation were used as

proxies to generate deviations from country‐specific inflation rates.

Tables 8 and 9 differ only according to the proxy for financial crises. Bordo and

Landon Lane’s (2010) definition of GFCs is used as a determinant while, in Table 9,

Bordo and Meissner’s (2016) combined banking and currency crises serve as a proxy

for the impact of crises on inflation. 44 Finally, Table 10 estimates the same

relationship for the Gold Standard period only based on the dates provided in Table

2.

We focus on the common features found in these results and their implications.

Financial crises, whether of the global or domestic variety, affect inflation



44Combining both types of crises seem to produce better results than separately including banking
and currency crises.

                                                                                              45
performance negatively. However, the impact is quantitatively largest when the crisis

is global. In contrast, crises are found to have a much smaller impact on deviations in

inflation from a benchmark during the Gold Standard era. Output growth is also seen,

on average, as raising inflation relative to any of the benchmarks considered, other

than for the Gold Standard period. These results merely confirm that inflation and

aggregate economic activity links are severed during the Gold Standard but are a

feature of the full sample.

If fiscal dominance is proxied by the debt to GDP ratio then this too is a feature of

central banking outside the Gold Standard era. Nevertheless, even if this variable is

statistically significant it does not appear to be economically significant as it is

dwarfed by the real and financial crises variables. Equally interesting is the finding

that deviations in inflation from some benchmark are highly persistent in the Gold

Standard era while there is much less persistence in the full sample estimates. Hence,

once domestic inflation moves away from the benchmark, there is a relatively fast

return to the benchmark. In other words, to the extent that this represents a global

factor not captured by the benchmark it exerts less impact since the end of the Gold

Standard. One way of thinking about the results is that there is potentially greater

variation in inflation regimes after World War II ended relative to some global

benchmark (e.g., the US).

Three other results are notable from Tables 8 through 10. First, the exchange rate

variable does not exert any significant influence on inflation relative to the

benchmark. This suggests that the benchmark captures the global component.

Second, although oil price inflation raises inflation relative to the benchmark in all


                                                                                    46
regressions, the coefficient is economically small. Finally, once we omit fixed effects,

the determinants combine to explain a relatively small fraction of the variation in

inflation relative to some benchmark. Consistent with some of the other results there

may be sufficient idiosyncracies in inflation performance that cannot be adequately

captured in the panel framework. Alternatively, as Bernanke (2010) and Yellen

(2015), among other central bankers, have pointed out we still have much to learn

about what drives inflation dynamics.

Next, we turn to network effects in inflation performance. Table 11 and 12 evaluate

the degree of connectedness in inflation and real output growth performance. There

is clearly considerable variation in the degree of connectedness based on the

principal components analysis. Indeed, the latest ‘wave’ of globalization is clearly

seen in the data for the last two or three decades with brief spurts beginning in the

1950s and falling by the 1970s while the reduced importance of the first principal

component in the first decades of the 20th century is also evident. In contrast, there is

considerably more connectedness and persistently more so in inflation throughout

history. Nevertheless, the strong connection in inflation performance is clearly a

feature of the post‐World War II era. There is no indication that inflation targeting

per se has raised the degree of connectedness over the last two decades. However, as

noted earlier, first Bretton Woods followed by a stronger commitment to lower

inflation, together with more exchange rate flexibility, implies that the exchange rate

regime as it is defined here plays a smaller role than we think in explaining inflation

differentials.




                                                                                      47
The measure of connectedness based on G.C. tests (see Table 12) also suggests that

central banks behave as if they are part of a related network, at least insofar as

inflation differentials are concerned. Note that networks permit relationships to be

indirect. 45 Hence, the existence of a network does not imply how integrated

economies are, only that there are links, some stronger, some weaker, that tie the

inflation fortunes of the economies in question.46 Moreover, other than for ditGlobal ,

there is little empirical indication that this has changed markedly over almost century

and a half of data used here.

Finally, we turn to some counterfactual experiments. These are shown in Figures 7

through 9. Figure 7 shows what inflation would have been like if the Swiss National

Bank (middle), the US Federal Reserve (top), and the Bank of Canada (bottom) had

been in existence before they were actually created47. Data limitations imply that we

can only go back to 1870 for the SNB and Fed and 1913 for the BoC. The smallest

impact from the late introduction of central banking is observed for Canada. The

observed and counterfactual lines are almost on top of each other. It is worth noting,

however, that thanks to the Finance Act of 1907, Canada arguably had a quasi‐central

bank before the Bank of Canada’s creation (e.g., see Rich 1989).




45 This is most readily seen by visualizing networks as a collection of nodes that are linked with varying

degrees of strength. A typical application is the identification of bank networks. See, for example,
Rönnqvist and Sarlin (2016).
46 Indeed, the existence of network effects implies that economies need not be integrated for a shock

to have systemic or global effects.
47 Under the classical gold standard a central bank can only have a small impact on the price level

except in the sense that a credible central bank could temporarily use its policy rate to affect domestic
variables within the gold points which served as a target zone. See Bordo and Macdonald (2010).

                                                                                                      48
In the case of Switzerland, had the SNB been created in 1870 instead of 1907 inflation

would have been not much different, on average, but considerably less volatile.

Finally, in the US case, it is difficult to see any impact on inflation and inflation

volatility had the Fed been in place in 1870. It should be pointed out, as explained

above, that the raison d’être of the Fed lies in the search for financial stability not

inflation stability and the series of financial crises that hit the US throughout the

period shown testifies to the real problem with the monetary regime in the US.

Indeed, as shown in the next figure (Figure 8) which shows the counterfactuals for

real GDP growth, the chief benefit of an earlier central bank in the US would have been

observed through a substantial decline in the volatility of real GDP growth. 48 The

reduction in real GDP volatility is plain to see in all three cases shown with the impact

least dramatic for Canada, likely for the reason cited earlier.

Finally, we examine one more counterfactual, this time in the more recent era of

central banking. While some central banks are accountable via a numerical inflation

target (Canada, Norway, Sweden, the UK) others maintain they are equally

accountable in achieving low and stable inflation (the remaining countries listed in

Table 1) but not at the expense of an explicit recognition that real economic

performance is also part of their objective function. 49 Figure 9 then considers the

inflation and real economic growth consequences of inflation targeting (IT). We ask

what inflation and growth would have been if Canada (1991), Sweden (1993), and the


48 This result is also consistent with Miron’s (1989) finding that the founders of the Fed did not

believe their mission was to stabilize output. Instead, their role was to influence asset prices, as also
reflected in the drop in the seasonal variation of interest rates (also, see Mankiw, Miron, and Weil
(1994), and Mankiw and Miron 1991).
49 Since Norway adopted inflation targeting only in 2001 we opted not to consider this case since this

leaves us with relatively few (annual) observations.

                                                                                                      49
UK (1992) had not adopted an IT strategy. Adoption years of IT are in parenthesis.

The USA, Japan, and Switzerland did not adopt IT. Hence, these economies act as the

controls used to estimate the treatment effect of IT. We define the treatment period

as the period since Bretton Woods until IT is adopted.50

The left hand side of Figure 9 plots the observed and counterfactual estimates for

inflation while the right hand set of plots display the outcomes for real GDP growth.

It is immediately clear that inflation is almost always higher in the absence of an

inflation target. Other than for Canada, differences between observed and

counterfactual inflation rates actually exceed one or even two standard deviations

away from the mean observed inflation rates. Hence, the improvement in inflation

performance is considerable. Turning to real economic growth the evidence is more

mixed with real economic growth lower under IT than in the counterfactual case.

Once again the differences are larger for Sweden and the UK than for Canada. Note

that, among the three IT economies, Canada has the reputation as having adhered

most closely to its inflation target since the regime was introduced (e.g., see Siklos

2014).

Clearly, one can contemplate other counterfactuals but the methodology followed is

not well suited to carry them out. For example, one might have asked about what

might have happened if the gold standard had persisted beyond the 1930s, or if a

central bank had not been created after World War II. Unfortunately, the available



50 We considered other control periods with little impact on the conclusions. We also tried to include

France, Germany, and Italy, as part of the control group and our conclusions are unchanged. It should
be noted, however, that since these three economies adopted a common currency as well as
transitional arrangements in the lead up to the introduction of the euro it was deemed preferable to
exclude them from the control group.

                                                                                                   50
data does not permit the creation of a sensible set of common factors where the

treatment or intervention does not exist.

   5. Conclusions

Central banks have evolved considerably over the past three centuries. Globally, the

central bank is a comparatively young institution and its role as primary vehicle for

economic stabilization is both unique and also of fairly recent vintage. Nevertheless,

the history of monetary policy is also a turbulent one with several changes in policy

strategies adopted over time. There has clearly been an evolution of sorts, again on a

global scale, with a clear preference for some form of price stability even if many

countries eschew adopting a formal numerical target.

Just when a consensus of sorts developed that convinced policy makers that best

practice consisted in giving a central bank a clear mandate, narrowly focused on

attaining some inflationary outcome that would promote stable economic growth,

two major financial crises, beginning in 2007 until about 2012, that is, the so‐called

global financial crisis and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, led to some sober

second thinking.

Although there are few indications that price stability is no longer a desirable

objective central banks are being asked, or are adopting by default, to widen the

scope of their mandate to include evincing a concern for financial stability.

Historically, we have seen this. Indeed, long before some central banks were given a

macroeconomic stability mandate, their task was for a time largely centered on the

maintenance of financial stability. However, this took place at a time when little

thought was given about whether the monetary authority should be autonomous


                                                                                      51
from government. As we have now come to accept central bank autonomy as useful,

if not appropriate, it is less clear how this principle is squared with an expectation

that financial stability and monetary stability are both tasks that a central bank

ought to carry out. Moreover, for central banks in large economies or ones that have

a systemic impact on the global economy, this development may further restrict

their ability to improve how policy is conducted and to innovate. In the early days of

central banking this was not the case partly because these countries were the first

and also due to the greater frequency of financial crises necessitating change and

adaptation to new circumstances.

In contrast, small open economies have long been buffeted by the complications of

navigating the occasional conflict between domestic objectives and the impact of

external shocks, regardless of the exchange rate regime in place. As a result, there is

some evidence that there is more of a willingness to adopt different monetary policy

strategies than in many, but not all, of the systematically important economies, at

least based on observed choices made in recent decades. It remains to be seen

whether this finding will extend to how the maintenance of financial system stability

is managed.

The only thing that is certain is that we have not seen the last of attempts to

improve how monetary policy is conducted nor in how central banks are governed.

It is equally possible that just as the pendulum has swung back to the monetary

authorities evincing a concern for financial stability the same forces will lead to a

rewriting of the ‘contract’ between the central bank and the government. Whether

this means a loss of autonomy or the development of a contingent contract between


                                                                                        52
the central bank and government remains to be seen. Clearly, crisis times require a

different approach to policy than normal times.

second gives real GDP growth for the samples listed. The last column occasionally provides
two sets of figures because two separate regimes are considered.

Note: Inflation is 100 times the log difference of the price level. Deviations from the US and UK benchmark and global inflation.
A negative value implies below the benchmark. Standard deviations in parenthesis. Standard errors in columns (3) ,(5), (6), and
(7). For the USA the level of inflation is given in column (2). Global inflation is defined in the text and in the notes to Figure 6.
Global financial crises are the ones identified by Bordo and Landon lane (2010). Financial crises are as defined in Bordo and

Note: The benchmark means that the UK serves as the benchmark until 1912; thereafter the
benchmark is the US. For the US the first 3 columns are growth rates and not in deviation
form. Hence, the values are in italics. Full means data since 1870, data permitting. See the
appendix. Adj. means that the war years 1939‐1946 are excluded as data are missing for
some of the economies in the data set. Standard deviations in parenthesis. 100 times the first
log difference in real GDP is output growth. See the text for the definition of the global mean.
Crises are the global financial crises identified by Bordo and Landon Lane (2010).

Note: ADF refers to the Augmented Dickey‐Fuller statistic. Perron (1989) test with only an intercept break, an additive outlier
for the break, with the lagged dependent variable selected according to the Schwarz criterion, and a 10% trimmed estimate. The
breaks are found sequentially starting with the full sample (usually 1870‐2015, depending on data availability). In italics are
estimates are breaks before the central bank in question was established. * signifies rejection of the unit root null at least at the
5% level. NA means not applicable. Note that estimation samples are affected by the filter used as well as data availability. This
is especially the case for the factor model.

of banking and currency crises according to the Bordo and Meissner (2016) chronology. The
rank order is from largest to smallest number of financial crises. Column (3) is the number
of statistical breaks relying on the application of the Perron (1989) break test. See Table 6
for details about the estimation strategy. Column (4) indicates the fraction of financial crises
whose dates overlap with the ones obtained from a purely statistical analysis. Column (5)
represents the fraction of financial crises that are global in nature according to the Bordo

Note: See Table 5 for the dating of the GFC variable which is the Bordo and Landon Lane
(2010) chronology. Sample reflects adjustment for data availability and the filter used. The
absence of fixed effects follows the application of a redundant fixed effects test (F‐based
statistic; resu;ts available on request). The mean of the dependent variable is different from
zero because the precise samples over which individual filtered estimates are computed can
differ from the unbalanced sample used in estimation. This also explains that the total
number of observations is not number of years times number of cross‐sections.

Note: vertical dashed lines indicate the central banks used in this study. The bars represent
the difference between the year a central bank was established less the year of statehood or
independence. Data are from Central Bank Directory 2014 (London, UK: Central Bank
Publications) and the CIA World Factbook. The central banks explicitly labelled in the figure
are the subject of the empirical and narrative analysis in the present study.
