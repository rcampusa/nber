In this paper we estimate the causal effects on child mortality from moving into less distressed neighborhood
environments. We match mortality data to information on every child in public housing that applied
for a housing voucher in Chicago in 1997 (N=11,848). Families were randomly assigned to the voucher
wait list, and only some families were offered vouchers. The odds ratio for the effects of being offered
a housing voucher on overall mortality rates is equal to 1.11 for all children (95% CI 0.54 to 2.10),
1.50 for boys (95% CI 0.72 to 2.89) and 0.00 for girls – that is, the voucher offer is perfectly protective
for mortality for girls (95% CI 0 to 0.79). Our paper also addresses a methodological issue that may
arise in studies of low-probability outcomes – perfect prediction by key explanatory variables.

1. Introduction

       In this paper we seek to estimate the causal effects on mortality among

disadvantaged children from moving into less dangerous, economically distressed

housing and neighborhood environment. Our study takes advantage of a natural

experiment created by the random assignment of housing vouchers to public housing

families in the 3rd largest city in the U.S. (Chicago). Our study sample consists of every

public housing family that applied for a voucher in Chicago in 1997, when the city

opened its housing-voucher wait-list for the first time in a dozen years. Ours is thus one

of the largest randomized experiments involving voucher-induced changes in social

environments (together with Moving to Opportunity), and the first that we know of to

examine one particularly important and well measured health outcome – mortality.

       Health outcomes for children and adults vary dramatically across neighborhoods

within the United States, even after statistically controlling for various individual- or

family-level risk and protective factors. These patterns have generated concern among

both policymakers and scientists that health outcomes may be causally affected by

neighborhood attributes such as the physical environment (e.g., housing stock,

environmental toxins, crime), local institutions (e.g., health care providers, grocery

stores, parks), or aspects of the social environment that may shape people’s information,

preferences and norms about health-related behaviors (Kawachi and Berkman, 2003,

Sampson 2003). Yet variation across neighborhoods in health could instead reflect

differences in neighborhood compositions. Observational studies may confound the

causal effects of neighborhood and housing conditions with those of difficult-to-measure

individual or family attributes associated with both health and residential sorting.




                                              3
       As Jody Heymann and Aron Fischer (2003) have argued in their review of this

literature: “The best solution-oriented research to date has been conducted on moving

people out of hard-hit neighborhoods” through government housing programs. For

example, the one randomized mobility experiment that has been conducted to date,

Moving to Opportunity (MTO), found that MTO-assisted moves to less distressed

neighborhoods reduced obesity and mental health problems among adults, had mixed

effects on risky behaviors by youth, with girls doing better and boys on balance doing

worse as a result of the moves, and had no detectable effects on survey-reported child

health outcomes (Kling, Ludwig and Katz, 2005, Kling, Liebman and Katz, 2007,

Fortson and Sanbonmatsu, 2010). The results for children and youth in MTO are

particularly surprising in light of the large social-epidemiological literature. What

remains unclear is whether the gender difference in effects in MTO are idiosyncratic to

that sample, and, perhaps even more importantly, whether neighborhoods really do not

matter much for child health outcomes or if instead survey measures of health are too

limited to capture any impacts.

       Ours is the first study we know of to use a plausibly exogenous source of

identifying variation to estimate the effects of changes in housing and neighborhood

conditions on a particularly important, and well measured, child health outcome –

mortality. We match Vital Statistics mortality data from 1997-2005 to information on

every child age≤18 in every public housing household that applied for a housing voucher

in Chicago in 1997, when the city opened its housing voucher wait-list for the first time

in a dozen years (N=11,848). Our research design exploits the fact that families were

randomly assigned to the voucher program’s wait list, and only some families were




                                              4
offered vouchers. We estimate a discrete-time hazard model on overall mortality. Given

previous findings from MTO for important differences in the effects of neighborhood

mobility on youth outcomes, we examine mortality impacts for males and females

separately, as well as for the pooled study sample.

        The odds ratio for the effects of being offered a housing voucher on overall

mortality rates is equal to 1.11 for all children (95% CI 0.54 to 2.10), 1.50 for boys (95%

CI 0.72 to 2.89) and 0.00 for girls – that is, the voucher offer is perfectly protective for

mortality for girls (95% CI 0 to 0.79). These findings suggest that social environments

may play an important role in affecting the health outcomes of some of our nation’s most

disadvantaged children. The gender difference we find in the effects on health from

changing social environments echoes those from MTO, although as with MTO, the

reasons why responses are so different for males and females remain poorly understood.

It is interesting that in our data the suggestive (but not statistically significant) indications

of increased mortality to male youth from residential mobility are concentrated among

homicides, while declines in mortality to female youth are concentrated among deaths

due to disease and accidents.

        In addition to our substantive findings, our paper addresses a methodological

issue which we believe may increasingly arise in quasi-experimental research on low-

probability outcomes such as mortality. Among girls receiving the housing voucher, there

were no deaths after voucher assignment. This may result from having a large but not

massive data sample, a strongly protective treatment, and a low probability outcome. For

girls, the treatment is predicted to be perfectly protective, and Logit and Probit models do

not directly compute confidence intervals. We solve this issue by using “profile




                                                5
likelihood ratio confidence intervals.” These are constructed by finding the set of

parameter values that would not be rejected by a LR test at a 5% significance level.

        The next section of the paper discusses the potential mechanisms through which

changes in housing and neighborhood conditions may affect child health, and provides a

selective review of the previous empirical literature with an emphasis on studies with

strong research designs. The third section discusses our data and empirical approach.

Section four presents our findings and the final section provides some interpretation of

these results.

2. Conceptual framework and previous literature

2.1. Mechanisms

        Housing interventions that change people’s housing and neighborhood

environments could plausibly impact mortality through multiple channels, related to both

the physical and social environments of the neighborhood.

        Mobility could affect health for purely mechanical reasons, because housing and

neighborhoods are bundled with environmental health risk exposures. The physical or

institutional environment could also matter for health by affecting distance to, and hence

the price of accessing, health-related inputs. For example, a great deal of public attention

has been devoted to the possibility that disadvantaged urban neighborhoods may have

limited access to health care services, particularly preventive care, and to grocery stores

that sell fresh fruits and vegetables – or “food deserts.” Public concern has also focused

on the possibility that liquor stores, bars, and fast food outlets (or advertising for these

products) are disproportionately located in high-poverty urban communities.




                                               6
          Mobility to less dangerous and distressed housing and neighborhood conditions

could also affect health through social interactions, a possibility that has been of growing

interest among economists (see for example Manski, 2000, Becker and Murphy, 2001).

Local social environments could influence health-related behaviors through what Manski

calls “preference interactions,” if for example the preferences of one’s peers influences

one’s own drinking, through “constraint interactions,” as when elevated rates of criminal

behavior by other neighborhood residents dilute the amount police resources available to

stop and apprehend each offender, or “expectations interactions,” if people’s views about,

say, the health consequences of some behavior are shaped by the distribution of that

behavior and health outcomes in the area.

          For health outcomes to young children, we expect exposure to risk and protective

factors in the physical or institutional environment to be most relevant, as well as any

“neighborhood effects” on the behavior of parents that wind up influencing the health

inputs (and risks) that children experience. Data from the nationwide Vital Statistics

system shows that the two leading cause of death to blacks ages 1-4 in 2007 were

unintentional injuries (325 deaths) and homicides (168), which are disproportionately

likely to occur at the hands of parents or caregivers. Congenital anomalies accounted for

119 deaths in 2007 to this age group, while much less frequent were deaths from

important diseases such as cancer (55), heart disease (43), chronic lower respiratory

diseases (30), or influenza and pneumonia (29).1

          For older children and adolescents, their own behavior may be increasingly

important in determining their health outcomes. Particularly relevant may be behaviors

that put young people at risk for unintentional injuries and homicides, which for

                                              7
teenagers and adults is strongly related to anti-social behavior and lifestyle decisions that

themselves are thought by social scientists to be influenced by neighborhood

environments. For example, in Chicago in 2008 fully 92 percent of homicide offenders

and, more surprisingly, 72 percent of victims had a prior arrest record (CPD, 2008).

Nearly two-thirds of homicides were thought by police to result from altercations, while

nearly nine of every ten victims are male.

       Our study design and data provide us with limited power to disentangle the

importance of these different behavioral mechanisms. Our reduced-form estimates

instead capture the combined net influence of these different mechanisms that might be

affected by housing and neighborhood conditions on the behavior of parents and children

or youth. We try to gain some information about pathways by generating estimates

separately by gender, and by cause of death.

2.2 Relevant studies

       Previous epidemiological studies find strong correlations between neighborhood

socio-economic composition or social processes and a range of health outcomes, even

after regression-adjusting for people’s own individual health risk- and protective-factors.

For example, Waitzman and Smith (1998) find that people living in federally designated

poverty areas have higher rates of mortality even after controlling for individual

characteristics; Ross and Mirowsky (2001) find that living in a disadvantaged

neighborhood is associated with lower levels of self-reported health and physical

functioning; and Browning and Cagney (2002) find that individuals residing in

neighborhoods with greater collective efficacy report better overall health. Diez Roux et

al (2001) find that adults living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at significantly




                                               8
greater risk of developing coronary heart disease, even after controlling for income,

occupation, and education. Pickett and Pearl (2001), Kawachi and Berkman (2003), and

Macintyre and Ellaway (2003) provide excellent reviews of this literature. More recently,

Bird et al. (2010) have found that “good cholesterol” (high density lipoprotein or HDL),

and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with lower neighborhood

socioeconomic status controlling for other factors. The pediatric epidemiology literature

suggests that for children as well as adults, living in a high-poverty urban setting or

unsafe neighborhoods is associated with adverse health outcomes (Curtis, Dooley, &

Phipps, 2004; Lumeng et al., 2006).

       One concern with these studies arises from the possibility of endogenous sorting

of people into neighborhoods. Observational datasets cannot perfectly measure every

determinant of health outcomes, or of residential choices. As a result, with

epidemiological studies there is always some question about the possible confounding of

the causal effects of neighborhood environments on health with the influences of

unmeasured or hard-to-measure background factors that influence health directly and are

also associated with neighborhood selection.

       Votruba and Kling (2009) try to overcome this selection problem by examining

the effects on health from the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program, which starting in

1976 helped African-American public housing residents in Chicago to move to other

parts of the city or to very affluent, mostly-white suburban areas. Accounts of how

Gautreaux was implemented suggest that families had limited ability to choose where

they relocated (Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum, 2000). They find that mortality rates among

black males are relatively lower among those whose families relocated to neighborhoods




                                              9
where a relatively larger share of residents have a college degree. While these findings

are suggestive, Gautreaux did not randomly assign participants to locations and there is

some evidence of neighborhood self-selection.

       The one true randomized experiment that has helped move poor families out of

distressed public housing into less disadvantaged areas is the U.S. Department of

Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Moving to Opportunity (MTO)

demonstration. Starting in 1994, MTO enrolled a total of 4600 low-income public

housing families with children located in high-poverty census tracts in five cities –

Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. Among adults, medium-run

findings from the interim evaluation (4-7 years after baseline, pooling data from all five

sites) showed a lower prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30) for adults in the experimental

group than the control group (42.0% vs. 46.8%), together with some signs of increased

rates of exercise, improved diet, and improved mental health. No statistically significant

effects were detected for most other adult physical health outcomes, including self-rated

health, hypertension, physical limitations, or asthma (Kling, Liebman & Katz, 2007).

       Among MTO youth ages 15-20 at the time of the data collection (4-7 years after

baseline), analyses of an overall index of the absence of different health problems

revealed worse health for males in the experimental group relative to controls, but

positive effects on female youth (Kling, Liebman and Katz, 2007). This gender difference

in health impacts is also found in MTO impacts on a range of risky behaviors with the

one notable exception of violent-crime arrests, which seemed to decline among both male

and female youth who moved through MTO.




                                             10
No statistically significant MTO effects were found for specific measures of individual

health problems when examined separately, or for younger teens and children in the

interim MTO study (Orr et al., 2003; Fortson & Sanbonmatsu, 2010).

       One potential concern with the previous MTO research on child health stems from

the measurement of child health outcomes, which were all from parent reports of their

children’s health or child and teen self-reports. For example, MTO moves into less

economically distressed areas could improve access to medical care, which could in turn

increase awareness of health problems relative to the control group that lives in more

disadvantaged neighborhoods. It could also be that the standards that people use to decide

what counts as good or bad health, or even what rises to the level of trouble with some

specific health or functional problem, might be a function of the health status of others in

the community. To date nothing is known about the effects of MTO on objectively-

measured health outcomes for children, including one particularly important measure

(and the focus of our study) – mortality.

3. Background, Data, and Methods

3.1 Chicago’s Housing Voucher Program

       In July 1997 the firm running Chicago’s housing voucher program, CHAC, Inc.,

opened the program wait list for the first time in 12 years. 82,607 income-eligible

families applied, of whom 8,738 were in public housing at the time. All applicants were

randomly assigned to a wait-list. A total of 1,930 of the families in public housing at

baseline were offered vouchers by May 2003, at which point CHAC stopped offering

new vouchers. Our analytic sample consists of the 11,848 children ≤18 living in public

housing when their families applied for a voucher.




                                             11
3.2 Data

       The study sample is constructed using CHAC voucher application forms and

administrative records from the Illinois Department of Human Services (Jacob and

Ludwig, forthcoming), which include information about baseline addresses and socio-

demographic characteristics. Probabilistic matching was used to match our sample to

nationwide mortality records from 1997:Q3-2005:Q4 from the National Death Index

(NDI) using identifiers such names and dates of birth.

       Our main analyses focus on 69 cases with probabilistic match scores high enough

to be deemed “true” deaths by the NDI (National Death Index User’s Guide, 2009).

Previous validation studies find the NDI captures 93% of all deaths and 84% of deaths to

blacks (Calle and Terrell, 1993). Of the deaths in our sample, 54 occurred among the

9,342 control group children over our 8.5 year study period,for an annual mortality rate

of 68 per 100,000 (vs. 43 / 100,000 for blacks 1-19 nationwide in 2004) (WONDER,

2009). As a sensitivity analysis we also present results using a lower match-quality

threshold yielding 117 deaths to our sample, which provides one (admittedly imperfect)

check on the possibility that our results are driven by classification error in the matching

of mortality data to our sample.

       We use ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the NDI data to create measures of death

from specific causes: homicide, suicide, accidents, and all other causes, which for

convenience we call “disease” (the most common of which are deaths during the

perinatal period, leukemia / neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory

problems). There are too few suicides to analyze separately, so we focus on all-cause

mortality and our three specific causes.




                                             12
       For cost reasons we carried out post-lottery passive address tracking for a random

subsample of families. We link addresses to tract-level data from the 2000 census, annual

beat-level data on violent and property crimes per 1,000 residents from the Chicago

Police Department, and data from the 1995 community surveys of the Project on Human

Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, which includes measures of social disorder and

“collective efficacy,” defined by sociologists as social cohesion and local social control

measured at the level of a “neighborhood cluster” that contains 2.5 census tracts on

average (Sampson, Raudenbush and Earls, 1997). Unfortunately, no data on housing unit

quality are available for our sample.

3.3 Empirical Strategy

       We define our “treatment group” as children whose families were assigned a wait-

list number from 1-18,110, and so were offered a voucher by May 2003; the control

group is everyone assigned a higher lottery number. We first conduct an omnibus F-test

for differences between the treatment and control group using methods described in detail

elsewhere (Jacob and Ludwig, forthcoming).

       We then measure how the offer of a housing voucher affects the average post-

lottery neighborhood environments in which families live by essentially comparing the

neighborhoods of families offered vouchers with those of families randomly assigned to

the control group, known as the “intent to treat” (ITT) effect. Specifically we use

ordinary least squares to estimate equation (1) with a person-quarter panel dataset for

1997:Q3 through 2005:Q4, where y it measures child i’s neighborhood in quarter t,

PostOfferit =1 if child i’s family was offered a voucher prior to t, else 0, and X is a set of

controls including whether the family is offered a voucher some time after quarter t,



                                              13
gender, spline functions in baseline age (kinks at 1, 2, 5, 8 and 15) and calendar time

(kinks every 6 calendar quarters). We cluster standard errors at the household level to

account for serial correlation (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004).

(1)     yit    1 ( PostOfferit )  X   it

       Since not all families who are offered vouchers use them to lease up, we also

estimate the effect on neighborhood environments of using a voucher or not (the “effect

of treatment on the treated,” or TOT) by applying two-stage least squares to equations (2)

and (3). Intuitively, the TOT effect is essentially the ITT effect divided by the difference

in voucher utilization rates between treatment and control groups. We calculate the TOT

effect using PostOfferit as an instrumental variable (IV) for an indicator variable

Leasedit=1 if the family leases up with a housing voucher obtained from any source –

either the CHAC lottery or one of the smaller, specialized voucher allocations that

occurred during our study period, such as for families whose public housing projects

were demolished (Bloom, 1984, Angrist, Imbens and Rubin, 1996). As a benchmark for

judging the size of the TOT effect, π1, we present our estimate for the control complier

mean (CCM): the average outcome of children in the control group whose families would

have used a voucher if assigned to the treatment group, which can take on negative values

because of sampling variability (Katz, Kling and Liebman, 2001).

(2)     Leased it    1 PostOfferit  X   t   it

(3)     y it    1Leasedit  X   t  it ,

       For our main ITT estimates of voucher offer effects on mortality itself, we

estimate equation (1) within the framework of a discrete-time hazard model using Logit

models with Maximum Likelihood estimation (Allison, 1984). We use an unbalanced



                                                   14
person-quarter panel dataset that runs through either 2005:Q4 or the last quarter in which

the child is alive, whichever comes first. We report the coefficient β1 in odds ratio (OR)

terms for the probability of death in each quarter. The control variables are as above. As a

sensitivity analysis, we also present results that control for a broader set of covariates. We

also present the excess risk difference implied by our odds ratios, presented in terms of

deaths per 100,000 per year, and defined as the difference between the predicted risk for

the treatment group and the baseline risk (control mean, or CM):

(4) Excess risk difference = [(OR*CM) / (1 – CM + OR*CM)] - CM

       We re-estimate (1) separately for different causes of death (homicide, accident,

and disease) where deaths from other causes besides than the one being examined are

treated as censoring events. Motivated by previous findings from the MTO experiment

for a gender difference in how youth respond to residential mobility, we also estimate

equation (1) separately by gender.

       One data complication we encounter is that in our sample there are no deaths to

treatment-group females after the offer of a voucher, so a value of 1 for PostOffer is

perfectly predictive of mortality outcomes. As such the Logit coefficient on treatment is

negative infinity, and Logit standard errors are undefined. This makes typical

construction of standard errors infeasible. Without consistent standard errors (or finite

point estimates) we are unable to construct Wald test statistics for hypothesis testing or

confidence intervals constructed in the usual way (based on inverting the Wald test

statistic). Additionally, this data circumstance makes us doubtful of whether the Linear

Probability Model (which does give a point estimate and estimated standard error) can

accurately approximate the binary outcome response to treatment for girls.




                                             15
        We are still able to test null hypotheses about the parameter of interest using

Likelihood Ratio (LR) tests. In the unrestricted model, the “treated-by-post” observations

are perfectly predicted, and so contribute zero to the log likelihood. In the restricted

model, we impose the null hypothesis on the treatment parameter, maximize the

likelihood function over the remaining parameters, and use the resulting log likelihood

for the test. In our tables, we report p-values from Likelihood Ratio (LR) tests of the null

hypothesis of no impact (Lehmann and Romano, 2005).

        We can also use LR tests to construct 95% confidence intervals. To do so we find

the set of parameter values that would not be rejected by a LR test at a 5% significance

level (Lehmann and Romano, 2005). Due to the process of trying out a range of values

and testing each, the resulting confidence intervals are called “profile likelihood ratio

confidence intervals.”

        We view this problem as essentially a “small sample” problem, even though we

have large samples (N>200,000) of at-risk children-quarters. Presumably the true impact

of the voucher on mortality is not perfectly protective, but deaths are uncommon enough

that a strongly protective treatment, plus a bit of luck, can result in zero observed deaths.

We believe that this type of problem may be common in settings where researchers

combine high-quality quasi-experiments with large but not immense data samples and

low-probability outcomes (such as mortality or uncommon diseases or conditions). We

believe that profile likelihood ratio confidence intervals can be a useful approach in such

settings.

        We also replicate our mortality results by applying linear probability models to

equation (1) to estimate ITT effects and to equations (2) and (3) to obtain TOT estimates.




                                              16
We report results in terms of deaths per 100,000 children per year. We use linear

probability models for this sensitivity analysis, despite their well--known limitations,

because non-linear IV estimates can be sensitive to functional form assumptions (Angrist,

2001, Angrist and Pischke, 2009). We view the LPM results as least reliable for the girls-

only analysis, for reasons discussed just above.

4. Results

       Table 1 presents summary statistics of the baseline characteristics for the 2,506

treatment group youth and the 9,342 control youth. The p-value on the F-test of the null

hypothesis that the full set of treatment and control group means are jointly identical is

.46. Among treatment families, 66% leased up with a voucher at any point during our

study period (50% with a voucher from the CHAC lottery). Among the control group,

36% ever leased up with a voucher (none from the CHAC lottery).

       The third row of Table 2 shows that being offered a housing voucher (the ITT

effect) reduces the poverty rate in the average census tract in which families live over the

8.5 year study period (1997:Q3-2005:Q4) by 7 percentage points (95% CI -12 to -3

percentage points), compared to a control mean of 48 percent. The TOT effect is 26

percentage points (95% CI -46 to -7), compared to a control complier mean of 64 percent.

The difference between the CM and CCM implies families who would live in the most

distressed neighborhoods are the ones most likely to lease up with a voucher if offered

one. (Results by gender are in Appendix Table 1).

       The top panel of Table 3 presents our main results for the effects of being offered

a voucher (the intent-to-treat effect) on overall mortality rates for all children 18 and

under at baseline, and for males and females separately, from estimating equation (1)




                                              17
with Logit maximum likelihood. For the full sample, the odds ratio for the ITT effect on

all-cause mortality is equal to 1.11 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.10), and for males equals 1.50

(95% CI 0.72 to 2.89).

       Our main finding is that being offered a voucher is perfectly predictive of

mortality for females, so that the estimated odds ratio is 0 and the 95% likelihood ratio

confidence interval ranges from 0 to 0.79. The likelihood ratio test enables us to reject the

null hypothesis of no effect with a p-value of .03. The second panel of Table 3 replicates

our estimates controlling for all the baseline measures from Table 1, while the third panel

uses our alternative definition of death using a lower NDI match-quality threshold.

       The qualitative results for boys and girls are different (for girls the coefficient is

negative and significantly different from zero, for boys it is positive and insignificant).

To test for the equality of treatment effect across boys and girls, we estimate two models.

In the first all the coefficients are allowed to vary by sex, including that of treatment. In

the second, we constrain the treatment effect to be equal for boys and girls. However we

continue to allow the other coefficients to vary by sex. These two models are then

compared via a Likelihood Ratio test. This test results in moderate evidence against the

hypothesis of equal treatment effects (p = 0.09).

       Tables 4 and 5 present results separately for different causes of death using Logit

and linear probability models, respectively. The estimated voucher effect on deaths from

disease are of the same sign for male and female youth, but for homicides and fatal

accidents the estimated effects are of the opposite signs for males versus females. The

linear probability model results suggest the effect of using a voucher (TOT) for females is

on the order of -130.2 per 100,000 (95% CI -207.6 to -50.4), driven by declines in deaths




                                              18
from disease (-73.6, 95% CI -132.92 to -14.28) and homicide (-41.36, 95% CI -83.32 to

0.56).

5. Discussion

         Our study examines the effects of moving into less distressed housing and

neighborhood conditions with the assistance of a housing voucher, taking advantage of a

natural experiment in Chicago resulting from the random assignment of voucher

applicants to the program wait-list. We show voucher receipt causes large declines in

neighborhood disadvantage, including for example a decline in census tract poverty rates

of 26 percentage points (40 percent of the control complier mean). While we do not have

measures of housing quality for our sample, data from the American Housing Survey

suggest that 10% of public housing units vs. 7% of those in the private market have

moderate physical housing problems, with no difference in severe housing problems

(HUD 2009).

         We find that moving out of high-poverty public housing projects in Chicago leads

to large declines in mortality rates for female children and youth. Determining the exact

magnitude of this impact is somewhat difficult in our study by the fact that there are no

deaths in our sample to females after their families are offered housing vouchers, but

presumably the true underlying probability of death to these girls is not zero. The 95% CI

for the odds ratio of the estimated effect of a voucher offer on all-cause mortality for girls

in our sample is (0, 0.79), as shown in Table 3, while the average annual mortality rate

during our study period is 38.2 per 100,000 for girls in the control group (Table 5).

Together these results imply that the intent to treat effect on all-cause mortality from

being offered a housing voucher is at least -8 deaths per 100,000 per year.




                                             19
       We also find that moving out of disadvantaged public housing does not have the

same protective effects on mortality outcomes for male youth. This pronounced gender

difference in mobility impacts on mortality echoes findings from the MTO mobility

experiment for other youth outcomes (Kling, Liebman and Katz, 2007, Kling, Ludwig

and Katz, 2005). The fact that the point estimate for voucher effects on disease mortality

is of the same sign for male and female youth, but of opposite signs for homicides and

accidental deaths, suggests gender differences in mobility effects on risky behavior as a

possible behavioral mechanism underlying these findings. Although our findings for

homicides and accidents for boys are limited in their statistical power, the point estimates

are consistent with the MTO studies, finding that boys were more likely to be injured or

engage in other problem behaviors.

       The main challenge this study faces is limited statistical power due to few deaths.

This illustrates the difficult tradeoff for research in this field. Using population-level

observational data will give improved power, but at the cost of relying on less-credible

research designs. In contrast our study has the strength of a strong research design, but at

the cost of observing few deaths. It is unlikely that any study with randomized housing

treatment would be able to assemble a larger study sample, since our sample is the full

census of public housing families that applied for housing vouchers in the 3rd largest city

in the US. Finally, we can use our LR confidence intervals to provide bounds on the

magnitude of the impact, and these bound suggests a very large effect for girls - at least a

20% reduction.

       In thinking about the populations to which our findings may generalize, it is

important to recognize that our sample is extremely disadvantaged with respect to both




                                              20
their living conditions and health outcomes. While the U.S. poverty rate is around 13

percent (Census, 2010), the baseline census tracts for our sample were 60 percent poor.

Their average baseline police beats had violent crime rates of 39 per 1,000, compared to a

citywide average of 23 (CPD 2009), and nationwide average of 6 (FBI, 1997).

       In terms of the population excess risk, the Chicago Housing Authority’s 2000

annual report suggests there were 9,269 black females 18 and under living in public

housing. If the mortality rate in public housing overall was similar to our study’s control

mean, then if every public housing family that applied for a voucher in 1997 had been

offered one, the mortality rate for all youth black females in public housing would have

declined by 5 per 100,000 (17 percent).

       Our findings have implications for a wide range of housing policies that affect the

geographic concentration of poverty in America, including zoning rules that affect the

availability of low-cost housing (Roberts, 2009), siting decisions for new housing

projects (Hunt, 2009), and decisions about whether to fund housing projects versus

housing vouchers (Olsen, 2003, Friedman, 1962, Quillian, 2005). Forecasting the effects

of community-development interventions from our results is complicated by the fact that

the data available to us severely limit our ability to identify key mechanisms of action.

       Our findings also potentially have implications for health policy debates about

whether to try to equalize health spending across areas. Previous studies have shown, for

example, that a family’s own income helps explain some – but only some – of the

variation across areas in health expenditures (Sutherland, Fisher, and Skinner, 2009). Our

results suggest that the geographic concentration of poverty within an area may also

matter for health beyond each family’s own individual poverty status.

Notes: The unit of analysis is the child-calendar quarter. For cost reasons, address tracking was carried out
for just a random subset of 10% of our sample. Table comes from estimating equation (1) with ordinary
least squares, controlling for gender, an indicator for whether the family is offered a voucher at some point
after quarter t, and splines in baseline age and calendar time (see text). For ITT and TOT results, table
presents point estimate and 95% CI in parentheses. For TOT estimates, “treatment” is defined as use of any
voucher from any allocation during our study period (see text).

Notes: For counts of total number of deaths, please see Tables 3 and 4. The unit of analysis is the child-calendar
quarter. Table comes from estimating equation (1) with Logit maximum likelihood, controlling for gender, an
indicator for whether the family is offered a voucher at some point after quarter t, and splines in baseline age and
calendar time. For ITT and TOT results, table presents point estimate and 95% CI in parentheses.

Notes: The unit of analysis is the child-calendar quarter. For cost reasons, address tracking was carried out for just a random
subset of 10% of our sample. Table comes from estimating equation (1) with ordinary least squares, controlling for gender, an
indicator for whether the family is offered a voucher at some point after quarter t, and splines in baseline age and calendar time.
For ITT and TOT results, table presents point estimate and 95% CI in parentheses.
