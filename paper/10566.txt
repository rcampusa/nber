Growth Accelerations
Ricardo Hausmann, Lant Pritchett, and Dani Rodrik
NBER Working Paper No. 10566
June 2004
JEL No. O0, O5
                                       ABSTRACT

Unlike most cross-country growth analyses, we focus on turning points in growth performance. We

look for instances of rapid acceleration in economic growth that are sustained for at least eight years

and identify more than 80 such episodes since the 1950s. Growth accelerations tend to be correlated

with increases in investment and trade, and with real exchange rate depreciations. Political-regime

changes are statistically significant predictors of growth accelerations. External shocks tend to

produce growth accelerations that eventually fizzle out, while economic reform is a statistically

significant predictor of growth accelerations that are sustained. However, growth accelerations tend

to be highly upredictable: the vast majority of growth accelerations are unrelated to standard

determinants and most instances of economic reform do not produce growth accelerations.

1. Introduction

       Accelerating the process of economic growth in a sustained manner is just about
the most important policy issue in economics. Economists have long used a variety of
econometric approaches to shed light on why some countries grow faster than others.
Early work focused on cross-section econometrics, with growth rates over two or three
regressed on country characteristics and policies (Barro 1991, Barro and Sala-i-Martin
1992). More recent work has focused on levels-regressions with incomes (rather than
growth) as the dependent variable (Hall and Jones 1999, Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson 2001) and on panel econometrics which organizes the country-level data in
averages over five-year or other intervals (Islam 1995, Caselli, Esquivel, and LeFort
1996). The policy prescriptions coming out of this work have tended to be summarized
under three broad principles: openness, sound money, and property rights. There are by
now a number of good surveys and evaluations of this empirical literature, including
especially Temple (1999), Durlauf (2003), and Easterly (2003).

        A curious aspect of this literature is that it does not focus on what is perhaps the
most telling source of variation in the underlying data. As Easterly et al. (1993) first
pointed out and many others have reconfirmed since, growth performance tends to be
highly unstable. Very few countries have experienced consistently high growth rates
over periods of several decades. The more typical pattern is that countries experience
phases of growth, stagnation, or decline of varying length (Pritchett 2000). And standard
growth theory, whether of the neoclassical or the endogenous variant, suggests that our
best bet for uncovering the relation between growth and its fundamentals is to look for
instances where trend growth experiences a clear shift.

        This point can be seen from Figure 1.1, which shows the implications of a
(permanent) improvement in “growth fundamentals” at time T in the two classes of
models mentioned above. In the neoclassical growth model, growth accelerates at T, but
eventually converges back to the growth rate prevailing prior to T (unless the
fundamental in question is exogenous technological progress). In endogenous growth
models, growth accelerates permanently at time T. But in both cases, if we are interested
in identifying the relevant growth fundamentals, our best strategy would be to look for
changes that happen in the economy at or before time T. In other words, we can get
significant mileage by identifying the turning points in growth experience and asking for
what determines these transitions. If instead we lumped together data on growth without
paying attention to these turning points, we would be averaging out the most interesting
variation in the data.

        By organizing the data around the turning points in growth experience, we also
come significantly closer to answering the questions that most preoccupy policy makers.
Policy makers want to know: how likely is it that an economy undergoes a significant
acceleration of its rate of growth for a sustained period of time? What policies or other
correlates seem to be associated with such transitions? What can be said about the causes
of such transitions? Are they in line with current views as to the relative importance of
economic reforms and institutions? Policy makers may be rightly concerned about the
possibility that while the standard cross-country regressions tend to get the determinants
                                                  2

right over a sufficiently long time period, they are very poor predictors of turning points
of growth.

         They may also be concerned about the fact that growth regressions are based on
very strong assumptions about a single linear model being appropriate for all countries in
all states. There are a large number of models in which countries can be in different
“states” and can switch from state to state responding to factors that determine their long-
run equilibrium. For instance, in models with “poverty traps” the relationship between
policy variables and growth outcomes is not linear as a movement across a threshold can
cause a switch from a “trap” state to a growth state.

        Rather than postulate a common model of output determination and dynamics we
address these issues head on in this paper with empirical methods that begin by
identifying growth episodes and then examine their determinants. We define a growth
acceleration as an increase in per-capita growth of 2 percentage points or more (with
most of the episodes we identify exceeding this threshold by a wide margin). To qualify
as an acceleration, the increase in growth has to be sustained for at least eight years and
the post-acceleration growth rate has to be at least 3.5 percent per year. In addition, to
rule out cases of pure recovery, we require that post-acceleration output exceed the pre-
episode peak level of income. Using this approach, we develop some new stylized facts
about growth accelerations as well as analyze their predictability.

       Our basic results are as follows. First, we find that growth accelerations are quite
frequent. Using Penn World Tables data we identify more than 80 episodes of rapid
acceleration in economic growth that are sustained for at least eight years. The
unconditional probability that a country will experience a growth acceleration sometime
                                                             3

during a decade is around 25 percent. Second, we find that growth accelerations tend to
be correlated with increases in investment and trade, and with real exchange rate
depreciations. Third, political-regime changes are statistically significant predictors of
growth accelerations. Fourth, the nature of other determinants depends to some extent on
whether the acceleration is sustained into the longer term or not. External shocks tend to
produce growth accelerations that eventually fizzle out, while economic reform is a
statistically significant predictor of growth accelerations that are sustained. Finally, and
perhaps most importantly, we find that growth accelerations tend to be highly
unpredictable: the vast majority of growth accelerations are unrelated to standard
determinants such as political change and economic reform, and most instances of
economic reform do not produce growth accelerations.

        The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we develop a filter to identify
the instances in which countries experienced growth accelerations and discuss the
resulting sample. We also present some robustness analyses, including the use of the
World Development Indicators dataset in lieu of the Penn World Tables. Section 3
discusses the basic characteristics of growth accelerations and their correlates. Section 4
explores the predictors of growth transitions. Section 5 concludes.


2. Methods, descriptive statistics and robustness

        2.A) Methods and descriptive statistics

       We define the growth rate gt at time t over horizon n to be the least squares
growth rate of GDP per capita (y) from t to t+n ( gˆ t ,t + n ) defined implicitly by the
following:

        ln( yt + i ) = a + gˆ t ,t + n * t , i = 0,.., n

The change in the growth rate at time t is simply the change in the growth over horizon n
across that period:

        ∆g t = g t , t + n − g t −n , t

        We identify growth accelerations by looking for rapid growth episodes that satisfy
the following conditions.

        1)     gt ,t + n ≥ 3.5 ppa                         Growth is rapid
        2) ∆gt ≥ 2.0 ppa                                   Growth accelerates
        3)     yt + n ≥ max{ yi }, i ≤ t                   Post − growth output exceeds pre − episode peak

We take the relevant time horizon to be eight years (i.e., n = 7).
                                             4

         The timing of the initiation of the growth acceleration is chosen by finding the
year that maximizes the F-statistic of a spline regression with a break at the relevant year.
That is, since for some countries there are a number of consecutive years for which these
criteria of a growth episode are met, the “best” starting date is chosen by looking for the
best fit among all contiguous eligible dates. Countries can have more than one instance
of growth acceleration as long as the dates are more than 5 years apart (so a country
could accelerate from 0% to 3.5% in 1967 and then accelerate from 3.5% to 6.0% in 1972
as two distinct episodes).

       We use the Penn World Tables (PWT) 6.1 as our baseline data source since this
gives us data that go back to 1950. We eliminate from our sample all countries with
population less than 1 million, as well as all countries with fewer than 20 data points in
PWT. Since n = 7, the earliest and latest years for which we can identify episodes are
1957 and 1992, respectively.

        This filter yields a surprisingly large number of growth accelerations—83
episodes in all. Table 2.1 shows all of these episodes with the standard three-letter
country abbreviation and the year of initiation. The table is grouped by region and
decade and within each sorted by the magnitude of the growth acceleration. It is
comforting to see that our method identifies most of the well-known episodes of growth
acceleration that are commonly associated with discrete political changes or policy
reforms (e.g. China 1978, Argentina 1990, Mauritius 1971, Korea 1962, Indonesia 1967,
Brazil 1967, Chile 1986, Uganda 1989). But the fact that there are so many instances of
rapid growth indicates that growth accelerations are often produced by less noticable
changes. This is a point we will develop further when we turn to the analysis of
determinants.

        Aside from the sheer number of accelerations, the magnitude of the typical
acceleration is also striking. Conditional on a growth acceleration of at least 2 ppa, the
average acceleration was 4.7 ppa (median 4.0). This implies that in the typical episode
output stood almost 40 percent higher at the end of the episode than it would have been
without any acceleration. Moreover, there are many episodes of accelerations of 7
percentage points or more (e.g. Ghana 1965 (8.4), Pakistan 1962 (7.1), Argentina 1990
(9.2)).

        We estimate the (unconditional) probability of a growth acceleration by dividing
the number of episodes by the number of country-years in which an episode could have
occurred. The latter is calculated by summing up all the country-years in our sample and
eliminating a 4-year window after the occurrence of each episode, since our filter takes
this period as belonging to the same episode. Applying this rule we obtain 3097 possible
occasions in which an episode could have occurred. Dividing our 83 episodes by this
number we get that the average probability of a growth transition in our sample is about
2.7 percent per year. This means that a typical country would have about a 25 percent
chance of experiencing a growth transition at some point in any given decade.

              Another way of expressing the high rate of occurrence of growth accelerations is
      to note the proportion of countries that experience at least one such episode. Our data set
      allows us to search for growth accelerations for a total of 110 countries during the 36-
      year period between 1957 and 1992. (Note however that for many countries we are
      restricted to a shorter span of time.) Of these, 60 (or 54.5%) have experienced at least
      one growth acceleration and 23 (or 20.9%) have experienced two accelerations.

              Table 2.2 presents the number and probability of growth accelerations by region
      and decade. Looking at the growth experience by decades requires two caveats. The
      decade of the 1950s and 1990s have substantially fewer observations than the thirty
      intervening years. In the case of the 1990s, the absence is due to the fact that our filter
      requires the calculation of post-transition rates of growth, which means our last feasible
      year is 1992. In the case of the 1950s, the reason is the lack of pre-transition growth rates
      as well as the fact that many developing countries are absent from the dataset. With these
      caveats about the 1950s and 1990s, growth transitions exhibit a declining trend that may
      have been partially reversed in the 1990s.

              If we look at the experience by regions, the largest number of growth
      accelerations is in Asia, with 21 occurrences and an average probability of a growth
      transition of 4.3 percent for the full-sample period. We identified 18 growth accelerations
      in Africa, many more than one commonly associates with this continent, but that still
      adds up to the lowest probability of a growth transition of all the regions: only 1.97
      percent. We identified 17 growth transitions in Latin America but this adds to a below-
      average probability of 2.48 percent. We identified 12 growth transitions in Europe, but 5
      of them were in the 1950s when the region was recovering from WWII. Europe’s overall
      probability of a growth transition was 2.43 percent but with a rising trend in the 1980s
      and 1990s after very low numbers in the 60s and 70s. There are 10 growth transitions in
      the Middle East and North Africa which add up to the second highest probability.
      However, 9 of the transitions took place before 1980 and are presumably associated with
      oil booms.

        Since we are interested in both the initiation of episodes of rapid growth and in
whether or not the rapid growth is sustained, we also calculate the growth rates starting
eight years after the initiation of the episode. Obviously the longer the time period we
consider after the initiation of a growth episode, the more we lose recent accelerations.
Table 2.3 presents the growth episodes by their growth rate in the seven years preceding
their growth acceleration and in the ten years following their episode of growth
acceleration (i.e., in years [t+7, t+17]).

        This exercise distinguishes those episodes that were and were not sustained into
the longer term. We choose 2 percent growth as our threshold as this is (roughly) the
OECD average over the long term and hence is the rate which a country would need to
grow to converge with the industrial countries. Of the 69 growth episodes for which this
calculation can be undertaken, 16 had negative growth after the end of the episode, 16
had slow growth (between 0 and 2) and 37 had rapid growth. Figure 2.1 shows six
examples in which growth was sustained at a rapid pace after the first eight years of fast
growth.

       Figure 2.2 shows six examples of countries that experienced growth acceleration
followed by negative growth (Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Algeria) or slow growth
(Colombia, Brazil). Pakistan is an interesting case, as it had two episodes, one in 1962,
which was initiated from falling output in the previous seven years and was followed by
slow growth in the 1970s (1.8 ppa), and then another episode of rapid growth in 1979,
which was followed by growth of 2.3 ppa in the 1990s.

        Table 2.3 also distinguishes between those episodes that began from negative,
slow, or above average growth. While 15 of these 69 episodes were preceded by falling
output, 22/69 were initiated from slow and 32 of 60 from above average growth.

        Countries on the upper left hand corner had negative growth before and after the
growth episode. As can be seen, this group is dominated by African countries. Countries
in the lower row had high growth after the eight-year period. This group is dominated by
East Asian and European countries. This differentiation suggests that it would be
interesting to inquire about the determinants of whether a given growth acceleration is
sustained or not after the initial eight-year period. We will look more deeply into this in
section 4.

       2.B) Robustness of the definition of a growth episode.

         Before launching into further analysis of the correlates of growth episodes we will
discuss three issues with the robustness of our method of identifying growth
accelerations: (a) the parameters that define a growth episode, (b) the data used, and (c)
statistical issues.

       Parameters of the “filter”. We can illustrate the function of the filter by showing
graphically the initiation of a growth episode and then three examples of countries that
meet one or more but not all of the conditions. A classic growth acceleration is Indonesia
in 1967. In the years before 1967 growth was -0.8 ppa while in the eight years after 1967
growth was 5.5 ppa, for a growth acceleration of 6.3 percentage points.

        The key element in the filter is the combination of both a high level of growth and
a significant acceleration of growth. There are many cases in which growth improves
substantially but does not reach the threshold of “rapid.” Using an eight-year period and
the thresholds of 3.5 ppa growth and a 2.0 ppa increase are defensible, but admittedly
arbitrary. Obviously shortening the horizon of eight years identifies far more episodes
than 83. For example, using five-year growth rates identifies 125 episodes versus only 37
using ten-year horizons.

        Tightening or relaxing the thresholds of the filter produces the expected results. If
the threshold for change is 2 ppa but the growth threshold is raised to 4.0 ppa then only
68 episodes are identified versus 90 if the threshold is 3.0. With the threshold for
absolute growth at 3.5 ppa, raising the acceleration threshold to 2.5 yields only 67
episodes while lowering it to 1.5 identifies 93 episodes. We shall present a set of
robustness checks with these varying cutoffs when we discuss the predictability of
growth accelerations in section 4.

       In a similar exercise of examining the determinants of growth breaks (but which
does not distinguish between accelerations and decelerations) Jones and Olken (2004a)
use an algorithm that allows an arbitrary number of breaks and does not constrain these to
be separated by any given number of years. This has the expected effect of allowing
many “breaks” quite close together—so, while we identify one acceleration in Uganda’s
growth (in 1989) their method allows three breaks within 5 years.

        Data. Unless otherwise noted we use the Penn World Tables version 6.1 data. In
order to be sure that our estimates of growth episodes were robust to using a different
series for GDP per capita we also implemented exactly the same procedures using data
from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (see Table 2.4). Since the WDI
data begin in 1960, 27 of the 83 episodes lack adequate data for comparison. Of the 56
possible episodes for which there are WDI data 25 (45%) are identified as episodes with
exactly the same dates, 15 (27%) are identified as episodes with dates of initiation
differing by two years or less and another 6 (11%) are identified as episodes—but with
                                                   13

dates of initiation differing by more than two years.1 So on 81% of the 56 episodes there
is agreement on the basics. We take this to be encouraging.

        Ten of the 56 PWT-identified episodes produce different results when WDI data
are used. Four of the PWT episodes show an acceleration of growth but either do not
meet the threshold for rapid growth of 3.5% (MWI, GNB) or the change in growth is less
than 2 points (MYS, URY). This leaves six episodes on which the data sources just
disagree, including four instances in which the PWT data suggest an acceleration and the
WDI data show a fall in growth.

         Statistical issues. There are two major ways in which we differ from similar
literature. Papell and Ben David (1997) examine changes in growth by a similar search
over possible breaks in trend and then examine all and only “statistically significant”
changes in growth rates.2 This is not appropriate for our interests because this will
identify growth changes of very different magnitude because of the differing statistical
power caused by the underlying variability of the output series. It is possible that if a
“statistical significance” cut-off were used two countries with exactly the same
magnitude acceleration to exactly the same rate of growth but with different underlying
annual volatility could be classified differently. Since we identify growth changes of

  Bai and Perron (1998) extend this to multiple structural breaks and discuss problems with small sample
properties of such tests.

substantial magnitude our 83 episodes are also (almost) all statistically significant.3
There could be many “statistically significant” accelerations of growth that we do not
classify as episodes, because the increase in growth is economically not meaningful.

        The second issue is whether we use a log-linear trends or first differences to
estimate growth rates. Perron (1989) and others (Jones and Olken 2004a) have modeled
the evolution of output as a I(1) process so that first differences are stationary and hence
testing for “breaks” is testing differences in means of first differences. We suspect that
for our purposes nothing particularly significant hangs on this distinction in the modeling
of the evolution of output.


3. Growth accelerations: basic results

        At what income levels are growth transitions more likely? Basic convergence
stories hold that growth accelerations are more likely for poorer countries. We split the
data into income quartiles (Table 3.1) and find that for the period as a whole there is a
monotonically declining probability of a growth transition with rising levels of income as
would be implied by a global growth process that shows convergence. However, this is
not true of all decades. Probabilities slope steeply downwards in the 1970s and were
surprisingly flat in the 1990s. In the 1960s the lower half of the distribution performed
better than the upper half.4 In the 1980s the bottom half did worse than the upper half.
These patterns are not unlike the aggregate growth experience by decade, in that the
1960s were a good time for poor countries while the 1980s have been terrible.

        As a precursor to a detailed examination using regression analysis, it is interesting
to ask what simple correlates seem to be associated with the start of a growth transition.
This can be done by looking at the average value of a certain variable around the date of
the growth transition, which we take to be the years t-1, t and t+1 where t is the date of
the acceleration and compare it to the value of that same variable during the 7 previous

  However, the top quartile did better than the second quartile.

years. We ask the question whether changes in that variable are significantly different
from zero. Another aspect we can study is the correlates of growth during a growth
transition, in which case we compare the period covered between year t and year t+7 to
the average for the four years prior to the acceleration [t-1 through t-4].

        The results for both calculations are presented in Table 3.2. We study investment,
exports, imports, the real exchange rate and inflation. We find that growth accelerations
coincide with an increase in the export and import ratios which average 10.7 and 8.7
percent respectively, with increases in the investment ratio of 16 percent and by a large
real depreciation of 21.7 percent. All these results are highly statistically significant. We
do not find, however, that the terms of trade changes at the time of a growth acceleration
are significantly different from zero, although the estimated change is positive. We also
find a positive but not statistically significant increase in inflation at the time of the
transition. This result could mean that some growth accelerations take place in the
context of the resolution of a macroeconomic crisis.

         If we look instead at these same variables during the 8-year growth acceleration,
instead of just around the start of the process we find similar results except for the real
exchange rate. Export, import and investment ratios rise by an average of 14.6, 14.2 and
14.9 percent, respectively. However, real exchange rate changes are no longer
statistically different from zero and the estimated coefficient is now a fourth of the
estimated change at the time of the acceleration.

         Obviously, these results do not imply causality. However, it is interesting to note
that growth accelerations seem to require more investment, more exports and a more
competitive real exchange rate. Hence, they do not seem to happen by pure accelerations
in total factor productivity or in the increased import capacity emanating from a greater
availability of external funding.

4. Predictors of growth transitions
                                                   16

        We have shown in the preceding that growth accelerations are a fairly common
occurrence. Our data allows us to identify growth episodes over a maximum time span of
35 years (1957-1992) and yields 83 such episodes. Hence in any given year, there are
between 2 and 3 new growth transitions that are initiated around the world. In this
section, we analyze the predictability of these transitions. In particular, we ask: how well
do the standard explanatory variables do in predicting the timing of growth accelerations.
We focus on three types of predictors, relating to (a) the external context, (b) domestic
economic policies, and (c) political circumstances. We first analyze all growth
transitions taken together, and then distinguish between those that are sustained in the
longer term and those that aren’t.

        As we shall see, these three categories of explanatory variables have some
leverage in predicting growth transitions. Furthermore, sustained and unsustained growth
accelerations tend to be associated with somewhat different triggers. Perhaps the most
important conclusion of this section, however, pertains to the unpredictability of growth
accelerations. Despite a somewhat liberal interpretation of what predictability means in
this context, we find that there is only a loose link between favorable external, economic,
or political conditions (as measured by conventional explanatory determinants) and
growth accelerations. In particular, standard economic reform packages have marginal
effects on the probability that a growth transition will be initiated.

        4.A) Methods and data

         Our dependent variable is a dummy that takes the value of 1 around the time of a
growth acceleration (and 0 otherwise). More specifically, we assign a value of 1 to the
three years centered on the first year of the growth episode (i.e., the dummy equals 1 for i
= t-1, t, and t+1). The reason we allow a window around t is that there is a certain
amount of uncertainty that attaches to the identification of a specific year of growth
acceleration. A 3-year window reduces the probability that we will narrowly miss the
timing of an acceleration through quirks in the data or in our method.

       Our comparison group for a growth acceleration consists of the countries that
have not had a growth episode in that same year. So our sample consists of all countries
for which the relevant data are available, including countries that have not experienced
growth episodes. We make the following adjustments to the sample. First, for each
country, we drop the first and last seven years of data, since growth episodes could not
have been calculated for those years.5 Second, we drop all data pertaining to years
t+2…t+7 of an episode, since we are interested in predicting the timing of accelerations.

        We run probits where the dependent variable (the 3-year window around the date
of the year of growth acceleration) is regressed on several determinants. We will also
present estimates with alternative estimation strategies. All our runs contain a full set of
year effects to control for external circumstances that are common to all countries.

5
 We could also have dropped data for years in which a growth episode is not initiated (t-1, t, t+1)
somewhere in the world. However, this would have no practical effect on our sample since the years t-1, t,
t+1 of growth episodes span the entire sample from 1957 to 1992.
                                                    17



         Our explanatory variables can be categorized under three headings.

        (i) External shocks. It is plausible that many growth accelerations are triggered
by favorable external conditions. To capture this, we rely on a variable that is based on
the terms of trade. This is a dummy variable, TOT_Thresh90, which takes the value 1
whenever the change in the terms of trade from year t to t-4 is in the upper 90% of the
entire sample. This variable is meant to capture exceptionally favorable external
circumstances. We could also have used a variable related to capital inflows, but such
flows are endogenous and (presumably) forward-looking, rendering causal inference
problematic.

        (ii) Political changes. Growth accelerations can also be triggered by changes in
the underlying political balance as revealed by transformations in the political regime.
We use several variables to measure political regime change. Regchange takes a value of
1 in the five-year period beginning with a regime change as recorded in the Polity IV
dataset (Marshall and Jaggers 2002). (Regime change is defined as either a three-unit
change in the polity score or as regime interruption.) Poschange is 1 during this five-year
period if the regime change increased the Polity score (variable CHANGE in the Polity
IV dataset), denoting a movement towards greater democracy. Negchange is defined
analogously for a decrease in the polity score, and denotes a move towards greater
authoritarianism.6

        While the Polity variables are the main ones we use, we will also show results
with additional political variables. Lead Death is a dummy for the five-year period
starting with a political leader’s death. Tenure is an interaction term between Lead Death
and the length of the tenure of the dying ruler. These variables come from Jones and
Olken (2004b). War End is a dummy for the five-year period beginning with the
cessation of an armed conflict from the Correlates of War International War Database
(Singer and Small 2003).7 Civil War is a dummy for the five-year period beginning with
the ending of an armed civil war.8

        (iii) Economic reform. Perhaps the most important potential determinant from
our perspective is a change in economic policy that is conducive to higher economic
growth. To quantify such a change in economic policy, we rely primarily on an index
that was originally developed by Sachs and Warner (1995) and which has been
subsequently revised and updated by Wacziarg and Welch (2003). The Sachs-Warner
index was meant to capture changes in an economy’s openness to trade, but as argued in
Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001), the coding incorporated a number of structural features
(e.g. presence of marketing boards, socialist economic regimes) and the macroeconomic
environment (e.g. presence of a large black-market premium for foreign currency), in
addition to tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. The Wacziarg-Welch (2003) update

6
  Note that any change in the Polity score that is larger in absolute value than 20 (indicating Authority
Interruption or Authority Collapse, etc.) is coded as a zero.
7
  This variable is given as yearlef and yearlef2 in the original Correlates of War International War
Database.
8
  This variable is given as yearend1 and yearend2 in the original Correlates of War Civil War Database.
                                            18

continues with the same basic approach. This makes the Sachs-Warner-Wacziar-Welch
(SWWW) index a good candidate for a measure that captures broad economic reforms.
Hence we code Econ_Lib as a dummy that takes the value of 1 during the first five years
of a transition towards “openness” a la SWWW.

       In addition, we use a measure of financial liberalization, Finance, which is a
dummy for the first five years of a financial liberalization episode. The timing of
financial liberalization is taken from Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2001).

       4.B) Results

        Table 4.1 presents the main probit results. Our baseline specification, shown in
column (1), includes the terms-of-trade shock, political regime change, and economic
liberalization. The first two of these enter with statistically significant coefficients.
According to the estimates, a large positive terms-of-trade shock (as defined above)
increases the probability of experiencing a growth acceleration by 4.4 percentage points.
A political regime change increases this probability by 5.3 percentage points. In this
baseline specification, economic reform does not have a statistically significant impact on
growth acceleration, although its estimated coefficient is (as expected) positive.

        In the next three columns we probe the political determinants more deeply.
Column (2) decomposes the political regime change into a positive (towards democracy)
and negative (towards autocracy) component. The striking result is that while both of
these are separately significant, the impact of a movement towards autocracy is more than
three times larger (10.8 points versus 2.9 points). Column (3) shows that a political
leader’s death has a negative (but insignificant) impact on the likelihood of a growth
acceleration. When the leader’s death is interacted with the length of the leader’s tenure
(column 4), we get stronger results: a leader’s death is particularly damaging if that
leader has not been in office for very long. According to the estimates in column (4), a
leader’s death has a positive impact on growth acceleration when his tenure starts to
exceed about 10 years.

        Column (5) shows that financial liberalization has a strong positive impact on the
probability of experiencing a growth acceleration, increasing this probability by 7
percentage points. For some countries, mostly developed ones, the financial
liberalization variable is censored at 1980. In column (6), we enter a dummy variable
(Finance_Dev) that allows countries with censored values to have a different effect for
Finance, and we still get a very strong impact from financial liberalization. Note that the
estimated coefficient on economic reform turns negative when Finance is included in the
regression (but it remains insignificant). Columns (7), (8) and (9) show that armed
conflict (external or internal) does not have a significant effect on the likelihood of a
growth acceleration.

        Finally, columns (10) and (11) drop the terms of trade variable to regain
additional observations (allowing the sample size to rise from 2140 to 2903). The main
results are similar. In particular, economic reform remains insignificant and a political
                                              19

regime change in the direction of autocracy still shows up as a strong predictor of growth
acceleration.

        Our baseline results are quite robust to the method of estimation. Table 4.2
displays the results for a series of alternative methods. First, we show the results for
probits where standard errors are clustered by individual countries and corrected for
heteroskedasticity (column 1). Next we run a Tobit regressions, making use of the actual
difference in growth post-acceleration and treating non-episodes as censored at 0 (column
2). Third, we show the results from a modified logit framework suggested by King and
Zeng (2001) that is designed to better handle rare-ocurrence bias (column 3). Finally, we
run a random-effects probit (column 4). The results in all cases are not only qualitatively,
but also quantitatively similar. This is reassuring, and suggests that the probit results we
reported above are broadly representative.

        The probits in Table 4.1 utilize the entire sample of countries, including
developed countries. As another kind of robustness check, we present in Table 4.3 the
analogous results for a sample that includes only developing countries. In most respects,
the findings are quite similar. We note three small changes. First, “positive” political
regime change (i.e., democratization) is no longer statistically associated with growth
accelerations. It is only movements towards autocracy that enters with a statistically
significant and positive coefficient. Second, the estimated impact of financial
liberalization is much larger and almost double that found in the previous table. Third,
economic reform now enters with a statistically significant coefficient in runs that
exclude the terms of trade variable (columns 9 and 10).

        Our final set of robustness checks relate to the parameters of the filter and the
dataset we use. We discussed in section 2 alternative thresholds and the changes that
occur when we use WDI data instead of the PWT. We get a somewhat different set of
growth accelerations depending on choices make on each of these. To see how much
difference this makes in practice, Table 4.4 shows the results of our baseline specification
as we vary the set of growth accelerations. The main message is the robustness of the
political determinant. “Negative” political change is uniformly significant, with
coefficients that vary from 0.05 to 0.12. “Positive” political change is almost always
significant, but enters with much smaller coefficients. The terms-of-trade variable
generally enters with the correct (i.e. positive) sign and is significant, with the exception
of two instances when it enters with a negative (but insignificant) coefficient. Economic
reform remains insignificant (with the exception of one instance).

        We will further analyze and interpret these findings below. But first we want to
emphasize the limited success that our right-hand side variables collectively achieve in
predicting these major growth turnarounds. Even though many of the explanatory
variables are statistically significant, they explain very little of the growth pattern that the
data reveal. This point can be made in a number of different ways. For example, the
average in-sample predicted probability of growth acceleration generated by our baseline
probit conditional on an acceleration having taken place is only 0.101 (compared to an
unconditional prediction of 0.066). In other words, our empirical framework yields a 9-
to-1 odds against a growth takeoff for those takeoffs that actually materialized.
                                                    20



         This reflects the poor match between occurrences of growth takeoffs and
favorable external, economic or political circumstances. A lot of takeoffs take place
when those conditions appear not to be particularly favorable, at least as measured by
standard indicators. And growth takeoffs typically fail to materialize when the conditions
are indeed favorable. This is shown more systematically in Table 4.5 which displays the
proportions of growth accelerations that are preceded or accompanied by changes in our
list of determinants, and, conversely, proportions of changes in the determinants that are
accompanied or followed by growth accelerations.9 Of particular interest is the
predictive power of the economic reform variable (Econ_Lib). Since this variable rarely
enters significantly, we know that it does not have great leverage on the timing of growth
accelerations. Indeed, the table shows that only 14.5 percent accelerations are associated
with economic liberalization—or, equivelently, that 85.5 percent of growth accelerations
are not preceded or accompanied by liberalizations. And fewer than one in five episodes
(18.2 percent) of economic liberalization are followed by growth take-offs. More than
half of growth accelerations are preceded by political-regime changes; on the other hand,
only a tiny proportion of political-regime changes (13.6%) are followed by growth
accelerations.

         4.C) Sustained versus unsustained growth accelerations

        The results we have just discussed reveal some interesting, but also puzzling
associations. It is not clear a prori why transitions to autocracy should have more
favorable effects on growth accelerations than transitions to democracy. Nor is it clear
why financial liberalization should have such a potent impact on the likelihood of growth
accelerations when the impact of our broader measure of economic reform is weak at
best. It turns out that it is much easier to understand and interpret these results once we
distinguish between growth accelerations that are sustained into the longer term and those
that are not.

        Remember that our growth accelerations are defined for a time horizon of eight
years. That is, we require post-transition growth rates to be higher than pre-transition
rates by at least 2 percentage points and also to remain above 3.5 percent during this
eight-year period. We now make a distinction among accelerations according to whether
they were sustained beyond that eight year horizon. We call those episodes where the
growth rate remained above 2 percent in years [t+7 , t+17] sustained episodes, and those
where the growth rate fell below the 2 percent threshold unsustained episodes. Since this
classification requires 16 data points beyond the onset of a growth acceleration, not all
episodes can be classified as such.10 Therefore in the regressions below we have to work
with a somewhat smaller sample.

9
  As in the probits, we allow for a maximum of five years’ lag between a change in the determinant and the
growth acceleration. The timing of the latter is the three-year window centered on the dates listed in Table
2.1. Whenever this three-year window overlaps with the five-year window for the determinants, we count
it as a case where growth acceleration coincides with one of its determinants.
10
   But we did not automatically exclude all countries that do not have data from t+7 to t+17 to keep the
sample reasonable. If a country has data from t+7 to t+13, the growth rate for t+7 to t+17 is defined as the
annual average growth rate over this time.
                                                      21



        The first two columns of Table 4.6 show that the earlier results are more or less
replicated in this truncated sample. However, economic reform is now marginally
significant, while financial liberalization is marginally insignificant. We next distinguish
between sustained and unsustained accelerations and use them in turn as the dependent
variable. The results are interesting. The next four columns show that there are
significant differences in the determinants of the two types of growth accelerations. Most
striking among these differences are the following: (1) Positive terms of trade shocks are
conducive only to unsustained episodes; they have no predictive power over sustained
episodes. (2) Economic reform has a statistically and quantitatively significant impact on
the likelihood of sustained accelerations. (3) Financial liberalization’s positive impact is
confined to unsustained accelerations. (4) Positive political change (democratization) has
a significant impact on sustained episodes but not unsustained episodes.

        These results strongly suggest that sustained and unsustained growth accelerations
tend to be triggered by different conditions. Financial liberalization and positive external
shocks are associated with growth accelerations that eventually fizzle out. Fundamental
economic reform and positive political regime change increase the likelihood of sustained
accelerations.

        However, we need to repeat the same caveat as before: the predictability of these
different kinds of growth episodes still remains extremely low. The determinants of
growth episodes—whether of the sustained or unsustained kind—are very poorly
captured by our explanatory variables. The bottom panel of Table 4.5 shows the relevant
numbers. Only 16.2 percent of sustained growth episodes are preceded or accompanied
by economic liberalization, while only 9.1 percent of economic liberalizations are
followed by sustained growth take-offs. Growth accelerations seem to be driven largely
by idiosyncratic causes. To paraphrase Tolstoy, not even happy families are alike.


5. Conclusions

        We have focused in this paper on instances of significant acceleration in
economic growth. We close the paper by reiterating what we think are the two main
surprises that come out of our analysis. First, growth accelerations are a fairly frequent
occurrence. Of the 110 countries included in the sample, 60 have had at least one
acceleration in the 35-year period between 1957 and 1992—a ratio of 55 percent.
Whatever else this may say about growth, it certainly suggests that achieving rapid
growth over the medium term is not something that is tremendously difficult and it is
well within most countries’ reach (see also Rodrik 2003). This is a useful antidote to the
pessimism that often pervades policy discussions on growth.

       Second, and not unrelated to the previous finding, most growth accelerations are
not preceded or accompanied by major changes in economic policies, institutional
arrangements, political circumstances, or external conditions.11 As we have shown,

11
     For a specific instance of this finding, see Rodrik and Subramanian (2004) on India.
                                           22

standard growth determinants have some statistical leverage over the timing of
accelerations. But on the whole those determinants do a very poor job of predicting the
turning points. It would appear that growth accelerations are caused predominantly by
idiosyncratic, and often small-scale, changes. The search for the common elements in
these idiosyncratic determinants—to the extent that there are any—is an obvious area for
future research.

Cluster is a dprobit regression with standard errors clustered for each country group and corrected for heteroskedasticity.
Tobit is a tobit regression where non episodes are coded with a 0. There is no correction for heteroskedasticity.
Relogit is a logit model corrected for rare occurance bias as suggested by King and Zeng (2001).
Relogit M are the coefficients of the relogit model given as attributable risk.
This is the expected change in the probability of an episode going from a 0 in the dependent variable to a 1.
RE is a probit regression with country random effects. There is no correction for heteroskedasticity.
RE M is the marginal effect given at the mean for the dependent variable of the random effects probit regression.
