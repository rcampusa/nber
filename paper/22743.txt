                                         ABSTRACT

In advanced economies, a century-long near-stable ratio of credit to GDP gave way to rapid
financialization and surging leverage in the last forty years. This “financial hockey stick”
coincides with shifts in foundational macroeconomic relationships beyond the widely-noted
return of macroeconomic fragility and crisis risk. Leverage is correlated with central business
cycle moments, which we can document thanks to a decade-long international and historical data
collection effort. More financialized economies exhibit somewhat less real volatility, but also
lower growth, more tail risk, as well as tighter real-real and real-financial correlations.
International real and financial cycles also cohere more strongly. The new stylized facts that we
discover should prove fertile ground for the development of a new generation of macroeconomic
models with a prominent role for financial factors.

I.    Introduction

Observation is the first step of the scientific method. This paper lays empirical groundwork

for macroeconomic models that take finance seriously. The Global Financial Crisis

reminded us that financial factors play an important role in shaping the business cycle,

and there is growing agreement that new and more realistic models of real-financial

interactions are needed. Crafting such models has become one of the top challenges for

macroeconomic research. Policymakers in particular seek a better understanding of the

interaction between monetary, macro-prudential, and fiscal policies.

     Our previous research (Schularick and Taylor 2012; Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2011,

2013, 2016ab) uncovered a key stylized fact of modern macroeconomic history that we

may call the “financial hockey stick.” The ratio of aggregate private credit to income

in advanced economies has surged to unprecedented levels over the second half of the

20th century. A central aim of this paper is to show that, alongside this great leveraging,

key business cycle moments have become increasingly correlated with financial variables.

Most importantly, our long-run data provide evidence that high-credit economies may

not be especially volatile, but their business cycles tend to be more negatively skewed.

In other words, leverage is associated with dampened business cycle volatility, but more

spectacular crashes. Business cycle outcomes become more asymmetric in high-credit

economies, echoing previous research on the asymmetry of cycles (McKay and Reis 2008).

     A great deal of modern macroeconomic thought has relied on the small (and unrepre-

sentative) sample of U.S. post-WW2 experience to formulate, calibrate, and test models of

the business cycle, to calculate the welfare costs of fluctuations, and to analyze the benefits

of stabilization policies. Yet the historical macroeconomic cross country experience is

richer. An important contribution of this paper is to introduce a new comprehensive

                                              1
macro-financial historical database covering 17 advanced economies over the last 150

years. This considerable data collection effort that has occupied the better part of a decade,

and involved a small army of research assistants.

   We see two distinct advantages of using our data. First, models ostensibly based on

universal economic mechanisms of the business cycle must account for patterns seen

across space and time. Second, a very long-run perspective is necessary to capture

enough “rare events” such as major financial dislocations and “macroeconomic disasters”

to robustly analyze their impact on the volatility and persistence of real economic cycles.

   We begin by deconstructing the financial hockey stick. The central development of

the second half of the 20th century is the rise of household credit, mostly of mortgages.

Business credit has increased as well, but at a slower pace. Home ownership rates have

climbed in almost every industrialized economy and, with them, real house prices. Private

credit has increased much faster than income. Even though households are wealthier,

private credit has grown faster even than the underlying wealth. Households are more

levered than at any time in history.

   Next we characterize the broad contours of the business cycle. Using a definition of

turning points similar to many business cycle dating committees, such as the NBER’s,

we investigate features of the business cycle against the backdrop of the financial cycle.

The associations we present between credit and the length of the expansion, and between

deleveraging and the speed of the recovery, already hint at the deeper issues requiring

further analysis. Economies grow more slowly and generally more stably post-WW2.

Despite this apparent stability, financial crises since the fall of Bretton-Woods still occur

with devastating regularity.

   These broad contours lead us to a reevaluation of conventional stylized facts on

business cycles using our newer and more comprehensive data, with a particular emphasis

on real-financial interactions. The use of key statistical moments to describe business

cycles goes back at least to the New Classical tradition which emerged in the 1970s


                                              2
(e.g., Kydland and Prescott 1990; Zarnowitz 1992; Backus and Kehoe 1992; Hodrick and

Prescott 1997; Basu and Taylor 1999). Under this approach, the statistical properties of

models are calibrated to match empirical moments in the data, such as means, variances,

correlations, and autocorrelations.

      In the final part of the paper, we examine key business cycle moments conditional on

aggregate private credit levels. We find that rates of growth, volatility, skewness, and

tail events all seem to depend on the ratio of private credit to income. Moreover, key

correlations and international cross-correlations appear to also depend quite importantly

on this leverage measure. Business cycle properties have changed with the financialization

of economies, especially in the postwar upswing of the financial hockey stick. The manner

in which macroeconomic aggregates correlate with each other has evolved as leverage

has risen. Credit plays a critical role in understanding aggregate economic dynamics.


II.     A New Dataset for Macro-Financial Research

The data featured in this paper represent one of its main contributions. We have compiled,

expanded, improved, and updated a long-run macro-financial dataset that covers 17

advanced economies since 1870 on an annual basis. The first version of the dataset,

unveiled in Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2011) and Schularick and Taylor (2012), covered

core macroeconomic and financial variables for 14 countries. The latest vintage covers

17 countries and 25 real and nominal variables. Among these, there are time series that

had been hitherto unavailable to researchers, especially for key financial variables such

as bank credit to the non-financial private sector (aggregate and disaggregate) and asset

prices (equities and housing). We have now brought together in one place macroeconomic

data that previously had been dispersed across a variety of sources. This dataset is

publicly available at the NBER website.

      Table 1 gives a detailed overview of the coverage of the latest vintage of the dataset,

which gets updated on a regular basis as more data are unearthed and as time passes.

More details about the data construction appear in an extensive 100-page online appendix,

which also acknowledges the support we received from colleagues all over the world.

   In addition to country-experts, we consulted a broad range of sources, such as

economic and financial history volumes and journal articles, and various publications of

statistical offices and central banks. For some countries we extended existing data series

from previous statistical work of financial historians or statistical offices. This was the

case for Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. For other countries we chiefly

relied on recent data collection efforts at central banks, such as for Denmark, Italy, and

Norway. Yet in a non-negligible number of cases we had to go back to archival sources

including documents from governments, central banks, and private banks. Typically, we

combined information from various sources and spliced series to create long-run datasets

spanning the entire 1870–2014 period for the first time.


III.   The Financial Hockey Stick

The pivotal feature to emerge in the last 150 years of global macroeconomic history, as

was first highlighted in Schularick and Taylor (2012), is the “hockey stick” pattern of

private credit in advanced economies displayed in Figure 1. Focusing on private credit,

defined henceforth as bank lending to the non-financial private sector, we can see that

this variable maintained a relatively stable relationship with GDP and broad money until

the 1970s. After an initial period of financial deepening in the 19th century, the average

level of the credit-to-GDP ratio in advanced economies reached about 50%–60% around

1900. With the exception of the deep contraction in bank lending that was seen from the

crisis of the Great Depression to WW2, the ratio was stable in this range until the 1970s.

   Throughout this chapter we use the term “leverage” to denote the ratio of private

credit to GDP. Although leverage is often used to designate the ratio of credit to the

value of the underlying asset or net-worth, income-leverage is equally important as debt

is serviced out of income. Net-worth-leverage is more unstable due to fluctuations in

asset prices. For example, at the peak of the recent U.S. housing boom, ratios of debt to

housing wealth signaled that household leverage was declining just as ratios of debt to

income were exploding (Foote, Gerardi, and Willen 2012). Similarly, corporate balance

sheets based on market values may mislead: in 2006–07 overheated asset values indicated

robust capital ratios in major banks that were in distress or outright failure a few months

later.

    In the past four decades, the volume of private credit has grown dramatically relative

to both output and monetary aggregates, as shown in Figure 1. The disconnect between

private credit and (traditionally measured) monetary aggregates has resulted, in large part,

from the shrinkage of bank reserves and the increasing reliance by financial institutions

on non-monetary means of financing, such as bond issuance and inter-bank lending.

    Private credit in advanced economies doubled relative to GDP between 1980 and 2009,

increasing from 62% in 1980 to 118% in 2010. The data also demonstrate the breathtaking

surge of bank credit prior to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. In a little more than

10 years, between the mid-1990s and 2008–09, the average bank credit to GDP ratio in

advanced economies rose from a little under 80% of GDP in 1995 to more than 110%

of GDP in 2007. This 30 percentage points (pps) increase is likely to be a lower bound

estimate as credit creation by the shadow banking system, of considerable size in the U.S.

and to a lesser degree in the U.K., is excluded from our banking sector data.

    What has been driving this great leveraging? A look at the disaggregated credit data,

discussed in greater detail in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015), shows that the business

of banking evolved substantially over the past 140 years. Figure 2 tracks the development

of bank lending to the non-financial corporate sector and lending to households for our

sample of 17 advanced economies. The ratio of business lending relative to GDP has

remained relatively stable over the past century. On the eve of the global financial crisis,

bank credit to corporates was not meaningfully higher than on the eve of WW1.

Notes: Mortgage loans and Nonmortgage loans are expressed as a ratio to GDP averaged over the 17 countries
in the sample. Mortgage lending is to households and firms. Nonmortgage lending is unsecured lending
primarily to businesses. See text.


    Figure 3 tracks the evolution of mortgage and non-mortgage lending (mostly unse-

cured lending to businesses) relative to GDP from 1870 to the present. The graph demon-

strates that mortgage borrowing has accelerated markedly in the advanced economies

after WW2, a trend that is common to almost all individual economies. Mortgage lending

to households accounts for the lion’s share of the rise in credit to GDP ratios in advanced

economies since 1980. To put numbers on these trends: at the turn of the 19th century,

mortgage credit accounted for less than 20% of GDP on average. By 2010, mortgage

lending represented 70% of GDP, more than three times the historical level at the be-

ginning of the 20th century. The main business of banks in the early 1900s consisted of

making unsecured corporate loans. Today, however, the main business of banks is to

extend mortgage credit, often financed with short term borrowings. Mortgage loans now

account for somewhere between one half and two thirds of the balance sheet of a typical

advanced-country bank.

    It is true that a substantial share of mortgage lending in the 19th by-passed the

banking system and took the form of private lending. Privately held mortgage debt likely

accounted for close to 10 percent of GDP at the beginning of the 20th century. A high

share of farm and non-farm mortgages was held outside banks in the U.S. and Germany

too (Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal 2000). A key development in the 20th century

was the subsequent transition of these earlier forms of “informal” real estate finance into

the hands of banks and the banking system in the course of the 20th century.

    Moreover, even as we discuss the key aggregate trends, we do not mean to downplay



                                                      10
the considerable cross-country heterogeneity in the data. Table 2 decomposes for each

country the increase of total bank lending to GDP ratios over the past 50 years into growth

of household debt and business debt as well as secured and unsecured lending. The

percentage point change in the ratio of private credit to GDP in Spain was about three

times higher than in Japan and more than twice as high as in Germany and Switzerland.

However, it is equally clear from the table that the increase in the private credit-to-GDP

ratio, as well as the central role played by mortgage credit to households, are both

widespread phenomena.

   The central question that we address in the remainder of the paper is to see if and

how this secular growth of finance, the growing leverage of incomes, and the changes in

the composition of bank lending have gone hand in hand with changes in the behavior of

macroeconomic aggregates over the business cycle.


IV.   Household Leverage, Home Ownership, and House Prices

A natural question to ask is whether this surge in household borrowing occurred on

the intensive or extensive margin. In other words, did more households borrow or

did households borrow more? Ideally, we would have long-run household-level data

to address this question, but absent such figures we can nonetheless infer some broad

trends from our data. If households increased debt levels not only relative to income but

also relative to asset values, this would raise greater concerns about the macroeconomic

stability risks stemming from more highly leveraged household portfolios.

   Historical data for the total value of the residential housing stock (structures and land)

are only available for a number of benchmark years. We relate those to the total volume

of outstanding mortgage debt to get an idea about long-run trends in real estate leverage

ratios. Regarding sources, we combine data from Goldsmith’s (1985) classic study of

national balance sheets with recent estimates of wealth-to-income ratios by Piketty and

Zucman (2013). Margins of error are wide, as it is generally difficult to separate the value

of residential land from overall land for the historical period. We had to make various

assumptions on the basis of available data for certain years.

   Figure 4 shows that the ratio of household mortgage debt to the value of real estate

has increased considerably in the United States and the United Kingdom in the past three

decades. In the United States mortgage debt to housing value climbed from 28% in 1980

to over 40% in 2013, and in the United Kingdom from slightly more than 10% to 28%. A

general upward trend in the second half of the 20th century is also clearly discernible in

a number of other countries.

   Figure 5 shows that this upward trend in debt-to-asset ratios coincided with a surge in

global house prices, as discussed in Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2015). Real house prices

exhibit a hockey-stick pattern just like the credit aggregates. Having stayed constant for

the first century of modern economic growth, global house prices embarked on a steep

ascent in the second half of the 20th century and tripled within three decades of the onset

of large-scale financial liberalization.

   A second trend is equally important: the extensive margin of mortgage borrowing

also played a role. Table 3 demonstrates that the rise in economy-wide leverage has

financed a substantial expansion of home ownership in many countries. The idea that

home ownership is an intrinsic part of the national identity is widely accepted in many

countries, but in most cases it is a relatively recent phenomenon. Before WW2, home

ownership was not widespread. In the U.K. for instance, home ownership rates were in

the low 20% range in the 1920s. In the U.S., the homeownership rate did not cross the

50% bar until after WW2, when generous provisions in the G.I. bill helped push it up by

about 10 percentage points. For the sample average, home ownership rates were around

40% after WW2. By the 2000s, they had risen to 60% —an increase of about 20 percentage

points in the course of the past half century. In some countries such as Italy we observe

that homeownership rates doubled after WW2. In others, such as France and the U.K.

they went up by nearly 50%.

rates between advanced economies is still scarce. Differences in rental regulation, tax

policies, and other forms of government involvement, as well as ease of access to mortgage

finance and historical path dependencies, likely all played a role. Studies in historical

sociology, such as Kohl (2014), explain differences in homeownership rates between

the U.S., Germany, and France, as a consequence of the dominant role played by the

organization of urban housing markets. In all countries, the share of owner-occupied

housing is roughly comparable in rural areas; rather, the stark differences in aggregate

ownership rates are mainly a function of the differences in the organization of urban

housing across countries.

    Divergent trajectories in housing policy also matter. In the U.S., the Great Depression

was the main catalyst for new policies aimed at facilitating home ownership. Yet gov-

ernment interventions in the housing market remained an important part of the policy

landscape after WW2 or even intensified. In the U.S. case, the Veterans Administration

(VA) was established through the G.I. Bill in 1944. The VA guaranteed loans with high

loan-to-value ratios over 90%, with some loans passing the 100% loan-to-value mark

(Fetter 2013). 40% of all mortgages were federally subsidized in the 1950s. The G.I. Bill is

credited with explaining up to one quarter of the post-WW2 increase in the rate of home

                                                      14
ownership. In many European countries, the government already took a more active role

in the housing sector following World War I. But European housing policies tended to

focus on public construction and ownership of housing whereas in the U.S. the emphasis

was on financial support for individual homeownership through the subsidization of

mortgage interest rates or public loan guarantees.

   The experience with the Great Depression was also formative with regard to the

growing role of the state in regulating and ultimately backstopping the financial sector.

The most prominent innovation was deposit insurance. In the U.S., deposit insurance

was introduced as part of the comprehensive Banking Act of 1933, commonly known

as the Glass-Steagall Act. Some European countries like Switzerland and Belgium

also introduced deposit insurance scheme in the 1930s. In the majority of European

countries deposit insurance was introduced in the decades following World War II,

albeit with considerable institutional variety (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2013). However,

different American and European approaches to the organization of deposit insurance

are observable. This is because, at least in the early stages, European deposit insurance

schemes relied chiefly on industry arrangements. The U.S. stands out as the first country

that committed the tax payer to backstopping the banking system.

   A common effect of the depression, however, was that in almost all countries the

role of the state as a financial player increased. After the devastating consequences of

a dysfunctional financial sector had become apparent during the 1930s, the sector was

kept on a short leash. Directly or indirectly, the state became more intertwined with

finance. Among the major economies, Germany clearly went to one extreme by turning

the financial sector into little more than a handmaiden of larger policy goals in the 1930s.

In doing so, it inadvertently pioneered various instruments of financial repression (e.g.,

channeling deposits into government debt) that, in one form or the other, became part of

the European financial policy toolkit after World War II. For instance, France ran a tight

system of controls on savings flows in the postwar decades (Monnet 2014).

   In this long-run context, can we assay in any quantitative way the role played by

debt-income and debt-wealth changes over time in the evolution of leverage? To this end,

Figure 6 and Table 4 provide comparisons of borrowing, wealth, and GDP. The figure

displays three grand ratios for the average of the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany over

the post-WW2 era in 20–year windows. Panel (a) displays total private lending to the

non-financial sector (total lending) as a ratio to GDP (solid line); total lending as a ratio

to total wealth (dashed line); and total wealth as a ratio to GDP (dotted line). Panel (b)

of the same figure presents a similar but more granular decomposition to focus on the

housing market: the ratio of mortgages to GDP (solid thick line); the ratio of mortgages

to housing wealth (dashed line); and the ratio of housing wealth to GDP (dotted line).

Data on wealth come from Piketty and Zucman (2013) and are available only for selected

countries and a limited sample.

   Similarly, Table 4 displays these three grand ratios, again organized by the same

principles: panel (a), for all categories of lending and wealth; and panel (b), for mortgages

and housing wealth. The table provides data for the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany as

well as the average across all four which is used to construct Figure 6. It should be clear

from the definition of these three grand ratios that our concept of leverage, defined as the

ratio of lending to GDP, is mechanically linked to the ratio of lending to wealth times the

ratio of wealth to GDP.

    Figure 6 and panel (b) of Table 4 in particular, give a compelling reason to focus on

the ratio of mortgages to GDP rather than as a ratio to housing wealth. In the span of the


                                                     17
last 60 years, the ratio of mortgages to GDP is nearly six times larger; whereas, measured

against housing wealth, mortgages have almost tripled. Of course, the reason for this

divergence is the accumulation of housing wealth over the this period, which has more

than doubled when measured against GDP.

     Summing up, our study of the financial hockey stick has yielded three core in-

sights. First, the sharp rise of aggregate credit-to-income ratios is linked mainly to rising

mortgage borrowing by households. Bank lending to the business sector has played a

subsidiary role in this process and has remained roughly constant relative to income.

Second, the rise in aggregate mortgage borrowing relative to income has been driven

by substantially higher aggregate loan-to-value ratios against the backdrop of house

price gains that have outpaced income growth in the final decades of the 20th century.

Lastly, the extensive margin of increasing home ownership rates mattered too. In many

countries, home ownership rates have increased considerably. The financial hockey stick

can therefore be understood as a corollary of more highly leveraged homeownership

against substantially higher asset prices.


V.    Expansions, Recessions, and Credit

What are the key features of business and financial cycles in advanced economies over

the last 150 years? A natural way to tackle this question is to divide our annual frequency

sample into periods of real GDP per capita growth or expansions, and years of real GDP per

capita decline or recessions. At annual frequency, this classification is roughly equivalent

to the dating of peaks and troughs routinely issued by business cycle committees, such as

the NBER’s for the U.S. We will use the same approach to discuss cycles based on real

credit per capita (measured by our private credit variable deflated with the CPI index).

This will allow us to contrast the GDP and credit cycles.

     This characterization of the cycle does not depend on the method chosen to detrend

the data, or on how potential output and its dynamics are determined. Rather, it is

                                             18
based on the observation that in economies where the capital stock and population are

growing, negative economic growth represents a sharp deterioration in business activity,

well beyond the vagaries of random noise.1

    In a recent paper McKay and Reis (2008) reach back to Mitchell (1927) to discuss two

features of the business cycle, “brevity” and “violence” in Mitchell’s words.2 Harding

and Pagan (2002) provide more operational definitions that are roughly equivalent. In

their paper, brevity refers to the duration of a cyclical phase, expressed in years. Violence

refers to the average rate of change per year. It is calculated as the overall change during

a cyclical phase divided by its duration and expressed as percent change per year.

    These simple statistics, duration (or violence) and rate (or brevity) can be used to

summarize the main features of business and credit cycles. Table 5 show two empirical

regularities: (1) the growth cycles in real GDP (per capita) and in real credit growth using

turning points in GDP; and (2) the same comparison between GDP and credit, this time

using turning points in credit. In both cases, the statistics are reported as an average for

the full sample of 17 advanced economies, and for the Pre- and Post-WW2 subsamples.

    What are the features of the modern business cycle? Output expansions have almost

tripled after WW2, from 3.1 to 8.6 years, whereas credit expansions have roughly doubled,

from 4.2 to 8.3 years. On the other hand, recessions tend to be briefer and roughly

similar before and after WW2. Moreover, there is little difference (certainly no statistically

significant difference) between the duration of output and credit based recessions. The

elongation of output expansions after WW2 coincides with a reduction in the rate of

growth, from 4.1 to 3.0 percent per annum (p.a.), accompanied with a reduction in

volatility. Expansions are more gradual and less volatile. A similar phenomenon is visible

in recessions, where the rate of decline essentially halves from 2.9% p.a. pre-WW2 to

1.7% p.a. post-WW2.
   1 We use a per capita measure of real GDP here to account for cyclical variations in economic activity
across a wide range of historical epochs which vary widely in the background rate of population growth.

333).

    Interestingly, the behavior of credit is very similar across eras but only during expan-

sions. The rate of credit growth is remarkably stable through the entire period, from 4.7%

pre-WW2 to 4.5% post-WW2. Credit seems to grow on a par with output before WW2

(the null cannot be rejected formally with a p-value of 0.46), whereas it grows nearly

1.5 percentage points faster than output post-WW2, a statistically significant difference

(with a p-value below 0.01). In recessions, credit growth continues almost unabated in

the pre-WW2 era (it declines from 4.7% p.a. in expansion to 3.7% p.a. in recession) but it

grinds to a halt post-WW2 (from 4.5% p.a. in expansion to 0% p.a. in recession).

                                                      20
   Credit cycles do not exactly align with business cycles. This can be seen via the

concordance index, defined as the average fraction of the time two variables spend in the

same cyclical phase. This index equals 1 when cycles from both variables exactly match,

that is, both are in expansion and in recession at a given time. The index is 0 if one of the

variables is in expansion and the other is in recession, or vice versa.

   Using this definition, before WW2 the concordance index is 0.61 suggesting a weak

link between output and credit cycles. If output is in expansion, it is almost a coin toss

whether credit is in expansion or in recession. However, post-WW2 the concordance

index rises to 0.79. This value is similar, for example, to the concordance index between

output and investment cycles post-WW2.

   Another way to see the increased synchronization between output and credit cycles is

made clear in the bottom panel of Table 5. The duration of credit expansions is about 1

year longer than the duration of GDP expansions pre-WW2, but roughly the same length

post-WW2. Credit recessions are slightly longer than GDP recessions (by about 3-months

on average) but not dramatically different. Thus both types of cycle exhibit considerable

asymmetry in duration between expansion and recession phases.

   As we can also see in Table 5, things are quite different when considering the average

rate of growth during each expansion/recession phase. Whereas credit grew in expansion

at nearly 8% p.a. pre-WW2, output grew at only 1.6% p.a. After WW2, the tables are

turned. Credit grows 2 percentage points slower but output grows almost twice as fast.

On average, there is a much tighter connection between growth in the economy and

growth in credit after WW2. Perhaps the more obvious takeaway is that credit turns out

to be a more violent variable than GDP. Credit expansions and recessions exhibit wilder

swings than GDP expansions and recessions.

   These results raise some intriguing questions. What is behind the longer duration of

expansions since WW2? What connection, if any, does this phenomenon have to do with

credit? In previous research (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2013), we showed that rapid


                                             21
growth of credit in the expansion is usually associated with deeper and longer lasting

recessions, everything else equal. But what about the opposite, does rapid deleveraging

in the recession lead to faster and brighter recoveries? And what is the relationship

between credit in the expansion and its duration? Does more rapid deleveraging make

the recession last longer? In order to answer some of these questions, we stratify the

results by credit growth in the next two tables.

   In Table 6 we stratify results depending on whether credit in the current expansion is

above or below country-specific means and examine how this correlates with the current

expansion and subsequent recession. Consistent with the results reported in our previous

work (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2013), rapid credit growth during the expansion is

associated with a deeper recession, especially in the post-WW2 era. Compare here rates

of decline per annum, –1.8% versus –1.6% with the recession lasting about 5 months more.

However, it is also true that the expansion itself lasts about 3 years longer (and at a higher

per annum rate of growth). In the pre-WW2, expansions last about 9 months longer when

credit grows above average and there is little difference in the brevity of recessions.

   The shaft and the blade of our financial hockey stick thus also appear to mark a shift

in the manner in which credit and the economy interact. Since WW2, rapid credit growth

is associated with longer lasting expansions (by about 3 years) and more rapid rates of

growth (3.0% versus 2.7%). However, when the recession hits, the economic slowdown

is also deeper. In terms of a crude trade-off, periods with above mean credit growth

are associated with an additional 12% growth in output relative to a 1% loss during the

following recession, a net gain of nearly 11% over the 12 years that the entire cycle lasts

(expansion plus recession), that is, almost an extra 1% per year.

   As a complement to these results, Table 7 provides a similar stratification based on

whether credit grows above or below country-specific means during the current recession,

and then examines the current recession and the subsequent expansion. A High Credit bin

here means that credit grew above average during the recession (or that there was less

deleveraging, in some cases). The Low Credit bin is associated with recessions in which

credit grew below average or there was more deleveraging, in some cases.

    On a first pass, for the post-WW2 era only, low credit growth in a recession is

associated with a slightly deeper recession (less violent, but longer lasting, for a total

loss in output of 2.5% versus 2.25%), but with a more robust expansion thereafter (about

12% more in cumulative terms over the subsequent expansion, with the expansion lasting

about 4 years longer). There does not seem to be as marked an effect pre-WW2.

    Tables 6 and 7 reveal an interesting juxtaposition: in the post-WW2 era, whereas rapid

credit growth in the expansion is associated with a longer expansion, a deeper recession

but an overall net gain, it is below average credit growth in the recession that results in

more growth in the expansion even at a small cost of a deeper recession in the short-term.

It is natural to ask then the extent to which high credit growth cycles follow each other.

Is rapid growth in the expansion followed by a quick deceleration in the recession? Or

is there no relation? To answer these questions, one can calculate the state-transition

probability matrix relating each type of cycle binned by above or below credit growth.

This transition probability matrix is reported in Table A.1 in the appendix.

    Table A.1 suggests that knowing whether the state of the preceding expansion was in

the High Credit or Low Credit bins has little predictive power about the state in the current

recession or the expansion that follows (the transition probabilities across all possible

states are almost all 0.5). The type of recession also appears to have little influence on the

type of expansion the economy is likely to experience. However, in the post-WW2 era

we do find that a Low Credit recession is slightly more likely (p = 0.62) to be followed

by a Low Credit expansion. This contrasts with the pre-WW2 sample where a Low Credit

recession seem to affect only the likelihood (p = 0.71) that the following recession would

also be Low Credit. By and large, it is safe to say that the type of recession or expansion

experienced seems to have very little influence on future cyclical activity.

VI.    Credit and the Real Economy: A Historical and International

      Perspective

This section follows in the footsteps of the real business cycle literature. First we re-

examine core stylized facts about aggregate fluctuations using our richer dataset. Second,

we study the correlation between real and financial variables, as well the evolution of

these correlations over time in greater detail. The overarching question is whether the

increase in the size of the financial sector discussed in previous sections left its mark on

the relation between real and financial variables over the business cycle.

   We structure the discussion around three key insights. First, we confirm that the

volatility of real variables has declined over time, specially since the mid-1980s. The

origins of this so called Great Moderation, first discovered by McConnell and Pérez-

Quirós (2000), are still a matter of lively debate. Institutional labor-market mechanisms,

such as a combination of de-unionization and skill-biased technological change, are a

favorite of Acemoglu, Aghion, and Violante (2001). Loss of bargaining power by workers

is a plausible explanation for what happened in the U.S. and in the U.K. yet the Great

Moderation transcended these Anglo-Saxon economies, and was felt in nearly every

advanced economy in our sample (cf. Stock and Watson 2005). As a result, alternative

explanations have naturally gravitated toward phenomena with wider reach. Among

them, some have argued for the “better policy” explanation, such as Boivin and Giannoni

(2006). For others, the evolving role of commodity prices in more service-oriented

economies along with more stable markets are an important factor, such as for Nakov

and Pescatori (2010). Of course, sheer-dumb-luck, a sequence of positive shocks more

precisely, is Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson’s (2004) explanation. The debate rages on. And

yet, despite the moderation of real fluctuations, the volatility of asset prices has increased

over the 20th century.

   Second, the correlation of output, consumption, and investment growth with credit has


                                             25
grown substantially over time and with a great deal of variation in the timing depending

on the economy considered. Credit, not money, is much more closely associated with

changes in GDP, investment, and consumption today than it was in earlier, less-leveraged

eras of modern economic development. Third, the correlation between price level changes

(inflation) and credit has also increased substantially and has become as close as the

nexus between monetary aggregates and inflation. This too marks a change with earlier

times when money, not credit, exhibited the closest correlation with inflation.

     We start by reporting standard deviations (volatility) and autocorrelations of variables

with their first lag (persistence) of real aggregates (output, consumption, investment,

current account as a ratio to GDP) as well as those of price levels and real asset prices. In

keeping with standard practice in this literature, all variables have been detrended using

the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which removes low-frequency movements from the data.3

     Finally, we follow general practice and report results for the full sample, 1870–2013,

and also present the results over the following subsamples: the gold standard era (1870–

1913); the interwar period (1919–1938); the Bretton-Woods period (1948–1971); and the

era of fiat money and floating exchange rates (1972–2013). We exclude WW1 and WW2.

This split of the sample by time period corresponds only loosely to the rise of leverage on

a country-by-country basis. The next section of the paper directly conditions the business

cycle moments on credit-to-GDP levels for a more precise match on this dimension.


A.     Volatility and Persistence of the Business Cycle

Two basic features of the data are reported in Table 8: volatility (generally measured by the

standard deviation of the log of HP-detrended annual data) and persistence (measured

with the first order serial correlation parameter). In line with previous studies, our data

show that output volatility peaked in the interwar period, driven by the devastating
   3 Using λ = 100 for annual data. For a more detailed discussion of the different detrending methods
such as the Baxter-King bandpass filter and their impact on macroeconomic aggregates see the discussion
in Basu and Taylor (1999) as well as Canova (1998).

collapse of output during the Great Depression. The Bretton-Woods and free floating eras

generally exhibited lower output volatility than the gold standard period. The standard

deviation of log output was about 50% higher in the pre-WW2 period than after the war.

The idea of declining macroeconomic fluctuations is further strengthened by the behavior

of consumption and investment. Relative to gold standard times, the standard deviation

of investment and consumption was 50% lower in the post-WW2 years.

    At the same time, persistence has also increased significantly. In the course of the 20th

century, business cycles have generally become shallower and longer, as reported earlier.

A similar picture emerges with respect to price level fluctuations. In terms of price level

stability, it is noteworthy that the free floating era stands out from the periods of fixed

exchange rates with respect to the volatility of the price level. The interwar period also

stands out, but both relative to the gold standard era and the Bretton-Woods period, the

past four decades have been marked by a much lower variance of prices.

    Table 8 reveals a surprising insight: contrary to the Great Moderation, the standard

deviation of real stock prices has increased. As we have seen before, both output and

consumption have become less volatile over the same period. The divergence between the

declining volatility in consumption and output on the one hand, and increasingly volatile

asset prices on the other is also noteworthy as it seems to apply only to stock prices. The

standard deviation of detrended real house prices has remained relatively stable over

time. The interwar period stands out with respect to volatility of house prices, because

real estate prices fluctuated strongly after WW1, particularly in Europe, and then again

during the Great Depression, as discussed in Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2015).

    What about the behavior of different expenditure components over time? Table 9

shows that key empirical relationships established in the earlier literature are robust

to our more comprehensive dataset. Consumption is about as volatile as output (in



                                                     28
terms of relative standard deviations) although less so in the U.S. However, investment is

consistently more volatile than output (more than twice as much). Table 9 also shows that

these relationships hold for virtually all countries and across subperiods. There is some

evidence that the relative volatility of investment and government spending is declining

over time.

     We also confirm that consumption and investment are procyclical with output. This

comovement seems to increase over time, potentially reflecting better measurement. In

contrast to consumption and investment, government expenditures exhibit much less

of a systematic tendency to comove with output, suggesting perhaps a fiscal smoothing

mechanism at work. Net export changes are also only weakly correlated with output

movements.

     Overall, with more and better data we confirm a number of key stylized facts from the

literature. Output volatility has declined over time, consumption is less, and investment

considerably more volatile than output, and both comove positively with output. Govern-

ment spending and net exports generally fluctuate in a way less clearly correlated with

output. Despite broad-based evidence of declining amplitudes of real fluctuations, the

volatility of real asset prices has not declined—and, in the case of stock prices, actually

increased in the second half of the 20th century relative to the pre-WW2 period.


B.    Credit, Money, and the Business Cycle

Evaluating the merits of alternative stabilization policies is one of the key objectives of

macroeconomics. It is therefore natural to ask how have the cross-correlations of real and

financial variables developed over time. In Table 10, we track the correlations of credit

as well as money growth rates with output, consumption, investment, and asset price

growth rates. Thus, looking now at first differences, the main goal is to determine if and

how these correlations have changed over time, especially with the sharp rise of credit

associated with the financial hockey stick.

   These correlations have become larger. Table 10 shows that before WW2 the correla-

tions of credit growth and output growth were positive but low. In the post-WW2 era,

the correlations between credit and real variables have increased substantially, doubling

from one period to the other. This pattern not only holds for credit and output. It is even

more evident for investment and consumption, which were only loosely correlated with

movements in credit before WW2. Unsurprisingly in light of the dominant role played by

mortgage lending in the growth of leverage, the correlation between credit growth and

house price growth has never been higher than in the past few decades.

   The comparison with the cross-correlation of monetary aggregates with real variables

shown in Table 10 echoes our previous research (Jordà, Schularick and Taylor 2015). In the

age of credit, monetary aggregates come a distant second when it comes to the association

with macroeconomic variables. Real changes in M2 were more closely associated with

cyclical fluctuations in real variables than credit before WW2. This is no longer true in

the postwar era. As Table 10 demonstrates, in recent times changes in real credit are

generally much more tightly aligned with real fluctuations than those of money.

   The growing importance of credit is also a key finding of this part of the analysis.

In Table 11 we study the relationship between private credit, broad money, and price

inflation. Are changes in the nominal quantity of broad money or changes in credit

volumes more closely associated with inflation? Before WW2, broad money is generally

more closely associated with inflation than credit. Moreover, the relationship between

monetary factors and inflation appears relatively stable over time. Correlation coefficients

are between 0.4 and 0.55 for all sub-periods.

   The growing correlation between credit and inflation rates is noteworthy. In the pre-

WW2 data, the correlation between loan growth and inflation was positive but relatively

low. In the post-WW2 era, correlation coefficients rose and are of a similar magnitude to

those of money and inflation. The mean correlation increased from 0.33 in the pre-WW2


                                                31
era to 0.54 in the free floating period. Clearly, both nominal aggregates exhibit a relatively

tight relation with inflation, but here too the importance of credit appears to have been

growing.


VII.    Business Cycle Moments and Leverage

We have emphasized two important points in previous sections. First, we invoked the

financial hockey stick. Advanced economies over the last forty years have experienced

an unprecedented shift in bank lending relative to GDP after a preceding century of

near-stability. Second, the manner in which macroeconomic aggregates correlate with

each other has evolved over time. Moreover, such correlations can vary considerably from

one country to another within a given era.

   In this section, following up on the latter point, we focus our argument on a different

set of goalposts, but with the same purpose in mind. We now show that the alternative

approach of describing business cycle properties in terms of key moments has arguably

missed a very important driving force in the aggregate economic dynamics by ignoring

the role of credit.

   In this respect, and to zoom in on key stylized facts in the results that follow, we now

adopt a straightforward empirical approach to summarize the data, by looking at the

correlation (or, graphically, a scatter) of any given macroeconomic statistical moment of

interest (m̂) with the credit-to-GDP ratio (x̄). Formally, we take the panel data for all

countries i and all years t, construct rolling 10-year windows of data yit over the entire

sample within which we compute a country-window specific moment m̂(yit ) which we

seek to relate to the average credit-to-GDP ratio x̄it . Finally, we present the data and

correlations using a binscatter diagram. In all such diagrams that follow, the points

displayed are summary data for each moment computed when the credit-to-GDP ratio is

grouped into 20 bins. The full sample regression line is then also plotted. Country fixed

effects and a global real GDP per capita control are also included.

                                             32
A.     Central Moments are Correlated with Leverage

To start with some of the most widely employed business cycle moments, Figure 7

presents the mean, s.d., skewness and, 10th percentile of the annual growth rate of real

GDP per capita, real consumption per capita, and real investment per capita (in 10-year

rolling windows) using binscatters plotted against the (average in-window) credit/GDP

ratio for our full historical sample. Figure 8 reports the exact same binscatters, for the

exact same moments, but restricting attention to the post-WW2 sample. As a complement

and robustness check, we report pooled binscatters without country fixed effects or the

global real GDP per capita control in the appendix, and those results include variation

across both time and space.

     With four moments of three variables, the figure consists of twelve panels. It is

immediately apparent that the assumption of stable parameters is widely rejected by the

data. Nonzero slopes are clearly evident, and these slopes are statistically significantly

different from zero. Moreover, in some cases the binscatter displays possible nonlinearities

(e.g., the binscatter for the mean of real GDP growth in the first row, column (a) in Figure

7). We now discuss the results in more detail.

     In Figure 7, column (a), we see first in row 1 that mean real GDP per capita growth is

virtually uncorrelated with credit/GDP, but the mean does appear hump shaped, with

lower mean growth at very low levels of credit/GDP and also at very high levels. This

observation is consistent with an emerging notion: there can be ”too much finance.”

This literature, which argues that the link between the size of the financial sector and

economic growth may not be linear or monotonic (King and Levine 1993), with small

or even negative impacts possible when an economy is highly leveraged (Philippon and

Reshef 2013; Ceccheti and Kharroubi 2015; Arcand, Berkes, and Panizza 2015).

     In row 2 we see that the s.d. of real GDP growth is declining in credit/GDP, suggesting

a great moderation effect of sorts, whereby volatility has fallen as advanced economies

subtle angle to this story. Although the right tail of growth appears to become subdued

as credit/GDP rises, the left tail does not, as indicated by rising skewness of growth

outcomes. This rising skew fits with our earlier empirical work, in this and other papers,

and the work of others, showing that leveraged economies are more at risk of steeper

downturns and slower recoveries, often times these taking the form of financial crisis

recessions (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009, 2013; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Jordà, Schularick,

and Taylor 2013). From a theoretical standpoint, this result argues for macroeconomic

models with an allowance for banking or financial sectors whose scale can influence the

shape of recession outcomes. Even so, row 4 data on the lowest decile also suggest that

lower-tail outcomes are somewhat better under higher credit/GDP, so the volatility effect

dominates to mitigate the “rare disasters” as credit/GDP rises in this full sample setup.

   To summarize, we have shown that the key moments of real GDP per capita growth are

far from stable parameters, and historically they have varied with leverage. These results

were obtained exploiting the full sample, but the patterns in the post-WW2 sample, the

era of the financial hockey stick, may be even more interesting. In Figure 8 we therefore

repeat the analysis using only post-1950 data.

   The post-WW2 data tell an even more striking story. As before, more credit is

associated with less volatility in growth, consumption and investment, but the decline in

mean growth is much sharper. In the postwar data we are on the right side of the hump in

growth rates. Output skew also becomes more extremely correlated with credit/GDP in

the negative sense, even if the consumption and output correlations change less. Adding

up all the effects, the row 4 results on shifts in the lowest decile now indicate that lower-

tail outcomes are worse under higher credit/GDP, so the worse mean and skew effects

dominate to worsen the “rare disasters” as credit/GDP rises in the post-WW2 data.

   To present some simple summary data, in Table 12 we stratify the sample into high

and low bins, using the mean credit to GDP ratio as the threshold. We then calculate

business cycle moments with and without country fixed effects. The table shows again

that central business cycle moments change with leverage levels. But the full sample

and post-WW2 results again reveal the dramatic shifts that took place in the era of the

financial hockey stick.4

     The table thus reinforces the principal hypothesis of the paper: high credit is associated

with less volatility in growth, consumption and investment. Equally consistently, we find

that the mean drops, and skewness becomes more negative at high levels of debt. Credit

may be associated with a dampening of the volatility of the cycle, but is also associated

with more spectacular crashes, and worse tail events. In the post-WW2 period, the time

of the financial hockey stick, these patterns grow more pronounced.


B.      Cross Moments are Correlated with Leverage

Our next set of results explores whether high-frequency movements in the key macro

variables cohere with movements in credit, and whether these are stable relationships

over the wide span of historical experience. To summarize: yes, and no. Figure 9 presents

the correlation of annual growth rate of real GDP per capita, real consumption per capita,

and real investment per capita with the annual growth rate of real credit per capita using

binscatters plotted against the credit/GDP ratio for our full historical sample.

     Panel (a) shows that booms in real GDP per capita growth tend to be associated with

booms in real credit per capita, since this correlation is positive in general. However, in

low leverage economies this correlation is about 0.2, rising to more than double or 0.5 in

high leverage economies. So this reduced-form coherence of output and credit is much

amplified in more leveraged economies, an intriguing result.

     The same also holds true for both of the two key components of GDP, consumption

and investment. Panel (b) shows that the correlation of real consumption per capita
     4 The
         bins in the table use the mean credit to GDP ratio as the threshold variable. Almost identical results
are obtained if a smoothed variable, using the lagged 5-year moving average of the ratio, is employed
instead, and are therefore not reported.

growth and real credit per capita growth is positive and rising with the credit/GDP ratio.

Panel (c) shows that the correlation of real investment per capita growth and real credit

per capita growth is positive and rising with the credit/GDP ratio. These findings suggest

that the new generation of macroeconomic models need to match macro fluctuations in

such a way that both real consumption and real investment exhibit greater comovement

with credit in more leveraged worlds.

      Consistent with the above, our next analysis of cross moments asks if high frequency

movements in consumption and investment are correlated with GDP. This is a very

common business cycle moment which models have sought to match (e.g., Backus and

Kehoe 1992; Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland 1992). But again, as one might expect given the

prior results, these are not fixed parameters.

      Figure 10 presents the correlation of annual growth rates of real consumption per

capita and real investment per capita with annual growth rates of real GDP per capita,

with binscatters plotted against the credit/GDP ratio for our full historical sample. Panel

(a) shows that booms in real GDP per capita growth tend to be associated with booms in

real consumption per capita, since this correlation is positive in general. However, in low

leverage economies this correlation is about 0.4, rising to 0.7 in high leverage economies.

Panel (b) shows that booms in real GDP per capita growth tend to be associated with

booms in real investment per capita, since this correlation is also positive. However,

in low leverage economies this correlation is about 0.4, rising to 0.8 in high leverage

economies.

      Maybe this is all not so terribly surprising, since we have already seen from the previ-

ous figure that all of the growth rates of these three aggregates—output, consumption,

and investment—are more closely tied to the credit cycle as leverage rises; hence it is

to be expected that they should also tend to become more closely tied to each other.

Once again, this suggests that a key challenge for macroeconomic models is to develop a

formulation whereby the coherence of the macroeconomic aggregates operates through a

financial channel, and does so more strongly as the economy levers up.




                                                                    40
C.    International Moments are Correlated with Leverage

Our final set of results turns to the moments of notable relevance for those interested in

international business cycle models (e.g., Backus, Kehoe and Kydland 1999; Basu and

Taylor 1999). Devotees of this subfield ponder what we can learn from movements in

macro variables in multiple countries, either from looking at between-country correlations

in aggregate outcomes, and/or by looking at the moments of key cross-border indicators

like imports, exports, and the current account. We present three figures which give

an overview of our findings in this area, and which again confirm how even at the

international level, the key business cycle moments of interest in the literature have not

been fixed, immutable parameters, but have shifted in tandem with the size of domestic

financial systems.

     Using the now familiar technique of binscatters employed above, Figure 11 presents

three kinds of moments: volatility ratios of local annual growth rates of real consumption

per capita relative to real GDP per capita, local annual growth rates of real consumption

per capita relative to “world” (i.e., year sample mean) growth of real GDP per capita, and

also the volatility of “world” real GDP per capita, with each of these moments plotted

against the credit/GDP ratio for our full historical sample. The volatility ratio of local

annual growth rates of real consumption per capita relative to real GDP per capita are

fairly stable, and do not seem to depend much on leverage measured by credit/GDP;

they may even be falling slightly, albeit the ratio exceeds 1 throughout the range, which

indicates next to no international smoothing.

     This result is consistent with Backus and Kehoe (1992) and Backus, Kehoe, and

Kydland (1992). The volatility ratio of local annual growth rates of real consumption

per capita relative to world real GDP per capita falls as credit/GDP rises; but the ratio

again exceeds 1 throughout the range, which indicates limited risk sharing except in

cases with large financial systems. The volatility of world real GDP per capita has not

tended to fall as leverage rises. It may be asked how this is consistent with the earlier

result that country level real GDP per capita growth saw its s.d. fall as leverage rose, but

the answer lies in shifts in cross-country output correlations, as we shall see in a second.

These findings suggest that international macro models may need to take into account

the size of domestic financial systems when trying to replicate real world moments. In

worlds with larger financial systems, smoothing and risk sharing may be enhanced, but

at the global level, volatility may be increased, creating some potential tradeoffs (see, e.g.,

Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008).

       Figure 12 presents binscatters of four moments which capture the correlation of

local and world cycles. From first to last these are, respectively, the correlation of local

and “world” annual growth rates of real GDP per capita, real consumption per capita,

real investment per capita, and real credit per capita, with each of these shown using

binscatters plotted against the credit/GDP ratio for our full historical sample.

       Panel (a) shows that the correlation of local and “world” annual growth rates of

real GDP per capita is highly correlated with leverage measured by credit/GDP. Thus,

more leveraged economies have also tended to be economies with a local business cycle

more tightly linked to the world cycle. Panel (b) shows that the correlation of local and

“world” annual growth rates of real consumption per capita is also highly correlated

with the leverage measure. This shows that the convergence of consumption growth

to a common value, a risk sharing feature, seems to be associated with larger financial

systems. However, the prior result suggest that ceteris is not paribus, in that those same

highly leveraged economies also happen to have less risk sharing to do in the first place,

having stronger output correlations. This then helps to explain why, in the previous

figure, the consumption-output volatility ratio is relatively flat as leverage varies.

   Finally, panels (c) and (d) show that the correlation of local and “world” annual growth

rates of real investment per capita and real credit per capita are also highly correlated

with the leverage measure. Country-level investment and credit boom-and-bust cycles

tend to move more in sync with each other in a world with more leveraged economies. In

total, this set of results points to the important role that domestic and, collectively, global

financial systems might play in shaping business cycles at the local and world levels.

Greater commonality of cycles is apparent in output, consumption, investment, and credit

as financial systems lever up, and while this could reflect a purely coincidental increase

in, say, real common shocks that “just-so-happened” to arise in those periods, it is also

prima facie evidence that more leveraged economies may operate under very different

model parameters with greater transmission of real and or financial shocks possible in

worlds with more credit.

   In our very last set of results, Figure 13 presents binscatters of for key moments of the

three principal balance-of-payments variables, the annual change in the current account,

exports, and imports, all measured relative to GDP, shown in panels (a), (b), and (c) lined

up in columns. The first row of the figure shows the s.d., the second row the skewness,

and the final row the correlation with annual growth rate of real GDP per capita.

   The first row shows that the s.d. of the the annual change in CA/GDP is falling

slightly with leverage, even though the s.d. of the the annual change in Exports/GDP

and Imports/GDP are rising slightly with leverage. Thus it seems that increased volatility

of gross balance of payments flows may be more associated with leverage than is the case

for a net flow like the current account.

   The second row shows that all of the third moments show an amplification in the

negative direction with leverage, as skewness goes more negative for the annual change

in CA/GDP, Exports/GDP and Imports/GDP. In the case of the net flow in the current

account, these stylized facts suggests that models of reversals or “sudden stop” phenom-

ena may reflect some financial channels whereby a sharper correction is more likely when

the world is more leveraged. In the case of the gross flows measured by Exports/GDP

and Imports/GDP, the results could be seen to be consistent with models where the

cyclical influence of financial systems on trade flows can be particularly sharp during

contractions of credit and trade flows.

   The third row reveals subtle shifts in the cyclical correlations of the balance-of-

payments variables. The correlations of the annual change in CA/GDP, Exports/GDP,

and Imports/GDP with real GDP per capita are typically amplified by more leverage

as seen in other results. The change in CA/GDP is countercyclical (the correlation is

negative) but this effect is more negative with high leverage. The change in Exports/GDP

and Imports/GDP are both typically procyclical (the correlation is positive) but this effect

is more positive with high leverage, and for these variables Imports/GDP shows greater

procyclicality (rising from 0.2 to 0.6) than Exports/GDP (rising from 0 to 0.4) throughout

the range. This suggests that local leverage levels may hold more powerful influence

on the cyclicality of the import demand side than on the export supply side, lending

prima facie support for theories that emphasize the impact of financial sector leverage on

demand rather than supply channels.

VIII.   Conclusion

The advanced economies have become more financialized over the last 150 years, and

dramatically so since the 1970s. Never in the history of the industrial world has leverage

been higher, whether measured by private credit to the non-financial sector relative to

income as we do in much of the paper, or relative to wealth as we do for a more select

subsample of economies.

   A stark fact of our recent past, the “financial hockey stick” is a key feature of history

that is exposed by the new dataset we introduce in this paper. But beyond this, the

new data can help expand the catalog of available business cycle facts to a much longer

time frame, a wider range of countries, and a richer set of macroeconomic and financial

variables. Derived from an arduous, multi-year collection effort, the data can help to

further our progress towards a new, quantitative, macro-financial history of the advanced

economies from which we can derive new business cycle facts. The new facts seen

here have significant implications for macroeconomics, probably too many to discuss

individually, with many more yet to be discovered by others interested in exploring our

new data.

   At a basic level, our core result — that higher leverage goes hand in hand with less

volatility, but more severe tail events — is compatible with the idea that expanding

private credit may be safe for small shocks, but dangerous for big shocks. Put differently,

leverage may expose the system to bigger, rare-event crashes, but it may help smooth

more routine, small disturbances. This meshes well with two recent lines of thinking

about macrofinancial interactions.

   Many models with financial frictions in the tradition of the canonical Bernanke, Gertler,

and Gilchrist (1999) model share a mechanism by which small shocks to net worth are

amplified through financial feedback loops. The amplification channels generated by

these models typically operate through the corporate sector. However, such models based


                                            47
on corporate leverage have had mixed results when taken to the data (e.g., Kocherlakota

2000). We offer at least two explanations for this result. First, there is the observation that

the great leveraging of the second half of the 20th century took place primarily in the

household and not the corporate sector. Second, it is only with a much longer sample

that enough rare disasters can be recorded to analyze the data. Thus, we are led to

wonder if the less well-known extension by Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) with

an application to the household balance sheet has been unduly neglected.

   In other strands of the macro-finance literature, the household balance sheet is taking

center stage. Although the literature continues to build on the venerable Kiyotaki

and Moore (1997) model, increasing attention has shifted to households and mortgage

borrowing. Iacoviello (2005) is perhaps the most influential theoretical paper in this

tradition. On the empirical side, Mian and Sufi (2013, 2014) provide microeconomic

evidence on the role of housing leverage in the recent financial crisis and the pace of the

recovery from the Great Recession. Our data are entirely consistent with their findings

and with the dynamics generated by Iacoviello’s (2005) model.

   Other researchers have focused less on who does the borrowing and more on how

credit markets operate. Leverage makes the financial system less stable leading to

increasing systemic risks as new macrofinancial models with strong non-linear responses

to shocks show (e.g., Brunnermeier and Sannikov 2014). Adrian and Boyarchenko (2015)

show that higher leverage generates higher consumption growth and lower consumption

volatility in normal times at the cost of endogenous systemic financial risk. The predictions

of these models are also consistent with evidence emerging from our new data.

   Higher levels of debt may also trigger more pronounced deleveraging pressures in

case of a sharp fall in asset prices or a tightening of borrowing limits. Following the

logic laid out by Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) this may aggravate aggregate demand

shortfalls — consistent with our observation of fatter left tails in high-debt regimes.

Korinek and Simsek (2016) present a model where increasing household leverage gives


                                              48
rise to increasing aggregate demand externalities that may help explain the more severe

recessions experienced in highly leveraged economies.

   Along with financialization, we showed that advanced economies have become more

synchronized, perhaps lessening the ability to hedge financial risk internationally. More-

over, economies have become more stable over time just as asset prices have become more

volatile. In this regard, our results are in line with new research by Caballero, Fahri and

Gourinchas (2008) and Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009).

   New data open new horizons for exploration. Just as in any modern science, our

understanding of macroeconomics and finance evolves as new evidence is introduced,

whether to refute old theories, or to unearth new facts.
