1    Introduction

In this paper, we examine how open capital market policies would interact with the degree of

price rigidity in the domestic economy to affect the output-inflation tradeoffs and, similarly,

the volatilities of output and inflation in response to nominal shocks.           The analysis will

be conducted in an optimization-based “New Keynesian” framework                a la   Blanchard and

Kiyotaki (1987).   In the discussion, we extend to an open-trade and open-capital economy

the succinct exposition of Woodford (2000), which is conducted in the context of a closed

economy.

       Why is such extension potentially useful? Evidently, the degree of price stickiness is

related to the organization of markets–for instance, whether the labor market is common

or segmented.   Similarly, the degree of price stickiness can be affected by the openness of

the economy both in commodity trade and capital mobility.

       As an illustration, consider the evidence in Figure 1 below.         The left panel measures

the extent to which 4 groups of countries restrict capital movements based on the IMF’s

Annual Report on Exchange Rate Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.                       The right

panel provides their corresponding average output-inflation tradeoff parameters as estimated

by Ball, Mankiw, and Romer (1988).      The figure shows clearly that countries with greater

restrictions on capital mobility tend to have steeper Phillips curves.        This finding has been

recently substantiated by econometric estimations (see, Loungani, Razin, and Yuen (2001)).




2    The analytical framework

Consider a small open economy with a representative household that is endowed with a

continuum of goods-specific skills–uniformly distributed on the unit interval            , n]–to
                                                                                        [0         be

supplied to a differentiated product industry.       As a consumer, the representative household

has access to consumption of both domestic (distributed on          , n])
                                                                   [0       and foreign goods (dis-

        >From now on, we shall focus on the relation between aggregate supply of goods and

consumption smoothing made possible by international capital mobility.                           For this purpose,

we would not be concerned about the details of aggregate demand (including the demand for

money), international commodity trade, and the determination of the exchange rate.                                 For

simplicity, separability between consumption and real money balances is assumed for the

utility function.

        The relevant utility-maximizing conditions for our purpose include an intratemporal

condition for the choice of labor supply of type            j:
                                       vh (ht (j ); ξ t )        wt (j )
                                                            =                                                       (2)
                                        uc (Ct ; ξ t )            Pt
and an intertemporal condition for the consumption-saving choice:

                                      uc (Ct ; ξ t )
                                                          =   β (1 + r∗ ),                                          (3)
                                   uc (Ct+1 ; ξ t+1)
where   r ∗ is the world real rate of interest, assumed for simplicity to be time-invariant.                      This

latter equality is a consequence of the covered interest parity and the Fisher equation.

        As in the Dixit-Stiglitz model, demand for good                     j   satisfies


                                                          pt (j )   −   θ

                                      ct (j ) = Ct                          .                                       (4)
                                                           Pt
        The production function assumes the form


                                        yt (j ) = At f (ht (j )),

where   A is a random productivity shock.       The variable cost of supplying              yt (j ) is wt (j )f −1(yt (j )/At ),
which implies a (real) marginal cost of

                                                         wt (j )
                                 st (j ) =                                  .
                                             Pt At f  (f −1 (yt (j )/At ))
Using (2), we can replace the real wage above by the marginal rate of substitution. Imposing

                                                                    j

Among other things,                  Ytn       depends on the level of home consumption under flexible prices

(   Ctn ),   domestic and foreign prices (                  pt   and       p∗t ),   as well as the exchange rate (        εt ).    For later

purpose, we can denote                    s(Ytn , Ctn ; ξ t , At ) as snt .
             In the absence of capital flows,                    Ctn       =   Ytn   so that the natural output level is defined

When the economy is completely closed in terms of both commodity trade and capital flows

(n = 1 and Ctn = Ytn ), (6a ) further simplifies to
                                                           1 =   µs(Ytn , Ytn ; ξ t , At ).                                              (8)


In this last case, equilibrium output is completely independent of monetary policy.




3            The Phillips curve

This section derives the expectations-augmented Phillips curve of the kind hypothesized by

Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1970) for both open and closed economies.

             In order to obtain a tractable solution, we log-linearize the equilibrium conditions

around the steady state. We assume that                                β (1 + r∗ ) = 1, which is necessary for the existence
of a steady state.               In particular, we consider a                       deterministic     steady state where          ξ t = 0 and
At     =     A   with   εt   =   ε, p∗t   =    p∗ , and Ct       =   C.      Define     

deviation of any variable                      xt   from its deterministic steady state value                        x.    We can then

trendless given the assumption that                                          β (1 + r∗ ) = 1.              As a result,          Ct = 0 = Ctn .                 The Phillips

In the absence of capital flows, consumption smoothing can no longer be achieved and

consumption will fluctuate with domestic output (i.e.,                                  Ct = YtH      and   Ctn = Ytn ).         As a result,

that is produced domestically in the case of trade openness whereas                                             1   stands for the same

fraction (which is        100%)             in the case of a closed economy.                    Therefore, successive opening of

the economy will flatten the Phillips curve.

          As discussed in Woodford (2000), these sensitivity parameters are related to the de-

gree of strategic complementarity among price setters.                                          In turn, the latter depends on the

organization of markets. For instance, strategic substitutability (complementarity) will pre-

vail if all factor prices are (cannot be) instantaneously equalized across suppliers of different

goods, the case of common (segmented) factor markets. In our case, we show another exam-

ple where the organization of the world capital market matters–in particular, the integra-

tion or not of the domestic capital market into the world market.                                                Consumption smoothing,

which comes with the opening of the capital market, will increase the degree of strategic

complementarity, thus rendering prices more sticky and magnifying output responses.
