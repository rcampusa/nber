       Efficient uMyopichi Asset Pricing in Seneral Equilibrium:

            A Potential Pitfall in Excess Volatility Tests



                               ABSTRACT



    Excess volatility tests for financial market efficiency maintain

the hypothesis of risk—neutrality. This permits the specification of

the benchmark efficient market price as the present discounted value of

expected future dividends. By departing from the risk—neutrality

assumption in a stripped—down version of Lucas's general equilibrium

asset pricing model, I show that asset prices determined in a

competitive asset market and efficient by construction can nevertheless

violate the variance bounds established under the assumption of risk

neutrality. This can occur even without the problems of

non—stationarity (including bubbles). and finite samples. Standard.

excess volatility tests are joint tests of market efficiency and risk

neutrality. Failure of an asset price to pass the test may be due to

the absence of risk neutrality rather than to market inefficiency.

I.   Introduction

      In this short   note I point out some problems in conventional excess

volatility testing, which may lead to incorrect inferences concerning
financial market efficiency. The volatility tests initiated by Shiller

(1981 a,b] specify the    benchmark efficient market price as the present

discounted value of expected future dividends.1 The maintained

hypothesis of risk neutrality that permits the intertemporal first—order

condition of the consumer—investor to be purged of unobservable marginal

utilities of consumption today and tomorrow, is crucial for the validity

of the model and of the excess volatility tests. Using a stripped—down,

one good, one asset version of Lucass (19783 asset pricing model, it is

very eay to get tractable solutions for the equilibrium asset price for

the constant relative risk aversion family of utility functions.

      With logarithmic utility, the price—dividend ratio is a constant in

this model, i.e. only the current dividend affects the current asset

price, regardless of the nature of the stochastic process governing

dividends. In this setting it is easy to come up with examples where

the "bubb1efree" equilibrium asset price with logarithmic utility

violates the variance bound derived under the assumption of linear




   Or earnings. My note focuses on problems with the excess volatility
tests that are present even when the countless econometric and data
práblems that complicate empirical tests are absent. The earnings vs.
dividends problem is not present in the model used in this note.

 utility. Without bubbles and with arbitrarily largesample size, the

 efficiently determined asset price would, according to the misconceived

volatility test, exhibit excessive volatility.



II. The Model and the Equilibrium Behavior of the 1sset Price

      The model is a baby version of Lucas's [l97) model of asset prices

in an exchange economy. The competitive exchange economy is inhabited

by a representative infinite—lived household with a time—additive

utility function. There is a single non—durable consumption good. The

economy receives each period a random lendowmentH or "dividend" dt of

this non—durable good. For simplicity, dt is assumed to be strictly

positive for all t, to have bounded support and to follow a Markov

process. The household owns a share in this stream of endowments. This

share is the only asset and there are no other sources of household

income. The share is traded and priced in a competitive market.
                                                                              ct
consumption of the non—durable good by the representative household in

period t. Pt is the price in period t (in terms of period t

consumption) of a claim to the entire future stream of endowments i.e.

it is the period t "ex—dividend" price of the asset.                 is the

household's demand in period t for a share in the future endowments.

      The representative household faces the following optimization

probl em.




      1)               Max              2               0 < ,8 < 1, u' > 0,       . 0

     B i5 the consumer's subjective discount factor. The single—period

utility function, u, is twice continuously differentiable, bounded and

increasing with u(0) =         0.   u is strictly concave except when the case of

linear utility (risk—neutrality) is considered, in which case it is

concave.

     Eti5 the expectation operator, conditional on the information set

at time t. This information set includes all current and past values of

the state variable dt and the true model, including the transition

function of the Harkov process governing dt. The market—clearing asset

price function co—determined by the consumer's optimizing behavior is

the same as the price function on which consumer decisions are based:

the equilibrium is a rational expectations equilibrium.

     The (interior) intertemporal first—order condition (or 'Euler

equation") of the representative agent can be written as




                               I' (Ct+i) t+i
     3)    U'                                   +
                (ce) Pt = Et                        dt+1)]

     Using the law of iterated projections and imposing the

transversality condition given in (4), thecurrent ex—dividend share

price can be written as in (5).
                                                                  5

          Pt =
                  u'(ct)    1E [u'c+ dt+.]


     Note that by imposing (4) we choose the ububblefreefl solution to

(3). The possibility of violating the variance bounds documented below,

is therefore not due to the presence of speculative bubbles (see e.g.

Flood and Garber El9B,)).

     Equilibrium in this exchange economy without durable commodities

requires that the endowment be consumed each period or (equivalently by

Wairas' Law) that the representative household willingly holds all

shares to the future stream of endowments, i.e.



    6a) c = dt                  t    1


         or

    6b) 8=l                     tl

         Substituting (6a) into (5) yields

         Pt                B1Et(u'(dt+.) dt+.)
                  u'(dt)



    In the case of linear utility (constant u') this reduces to
                                                                        6

       Starting with the work of Shiller t1981 a, b], this expression for

the current asset price (or share price) as the present discounted value

of   currently      expected future endowments (or dividends), has motivated a

number of related tests for the efficiency of financial markets.

       Define the ex—post rational price under linear utility,              as in

(9);




              *(J)       =

                     il $1(d- Etdt+.)



       By construction, u is orthogonal to              The dt process need not

be covariance stationary. If it isnt, its unconditional moments are

undefined. The variance bounds arguments will in that case be expressed

in terms of the innovations of (possibly non—stationary) stochastic
                                                                                     7




processes, which are well—defined. For any variable x, and any finite

positive integer n, the innovation based on period t—n information is

   —                      The innovation variance is defined by
       Et_(xt).

       Var(xt)            E{[x -
                                       Et(xt)]2}

       E is the unconditional expectation operator.

       Except for the trivial case where dt is strictly deterministic, it

then follows that



                    f•   *(l)     =   Var
                                            1(1)    +   Var

       12) Var
                                            {p                t        ) Varn Pt



       If the variance of the observed asset price process were to exceed
        *(1)
               ),   the variance bound in <12> would have been violated and a
var(pt
rejection of the joint hypothesis of- asset market efficiency and risk

neutrality would have been established.

       Riskneutrality or linear utility is, however, crucial to the

correct interpretation of the results from variance bounds tests, as the

following simple example makes clear. Let u(c) belong to the class of

constant relative risk aversion utility functions:



       13)     uCc) =      -c                   1                 0)




                            inc                          (V =     0)


               The asset pricing formula (7) now becomes
                                                                               8




       14)
                                0)
                                      1       /
             Pt =      dt      .
                               i=l



      The risk—neutral case of equation (8) is recovered from (14) by

setting      =    1.       Consider instead the logarithmic case (Y   = 0).   asset

pricing is now governed by


                 (0)
                       =                  2
      15)




      Thus1 with logarithmic utility, regardless of the stochastic or

deterministic nature of the process governing d, the asset will be

priced exclusively with reference to the current realization of the

dividend process.                    behaves like the price of a real consol with a

constant coupon of d and a constant short—real interest rate                       The

intuition is the following:3 with logarithmic utility, the marginal

utility of consumption is the reciprocal of the level of consumption.

The first—order condition (5) therefore becomes:

    Equation (15)          gives   the ex—dividend price; the price inclusive of the
                                          1
current dividend would be



    I would like to thank Vittoria Lrilli for guiding my intuition.

With a perishable commodity c =                          d.     The marginal benefit from

postponing consumption in period t (the r.h.s. of (5')) is therefore

independent of dt and of current expectations of future dt+1. The

marginal cost of postponing consumption in period t should therefore

also be independent of dt and of current expectations of future dt+.

This requires that the current asset price moves proportionally with the

current dividend.

the asset market is efficient by construction, in spite of the myopic

appearance of the equilibrium asset price equation. Vet                                      may easily

fail to pass the conventional variance bounds test based on linear

utility. Consider e.g. the case where dt is a constant plus a zero

Conclusi on

     Conventional volatility tests are joint tests of rational

expectations, competitive market clearing and risk—neutrality. Relaxing

the latter assumption may (and in the examples solved for in this note)

does make it impossible to interpret violation of variance bounds as

evidence against market efficiency.

     The optimal "myopic pricing function in the case of logarithmic

utility permits the construction of easy examples of an efficiently

determined asset price exhibiting apparent excess volatility. Finally,

in the perishable commodity universe of this note, a degree of risk

aversion in excess of that given by the logarithmic case (4/ < 0),

generates a negative effect of future expected dividends on the

    efficiently determined asset price while current dividends have a more

    than proportional positive effect! Its hard indeed to test for

    efficiency.
