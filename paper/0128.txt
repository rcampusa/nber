An algorithm   is   presented   which provides a complete solution to

the   optimal estimation problem for time-varying parameters when
no   proper prior   distribution is   specified.   The key ideas involve
a   combination of the infonrtion— form Kalman filter with the     two.-
filter interpretation of the opti1 smoother. The algorithm
produces efficient estintes of the parameter trajectories over
the entire sample, arid is equally applicable when a proper prior
distribution has been specified.

1. INTRODUCTION
    In recent years a significant body of literature has appeared which
is addressed to the problem of estimating time varying regression
coefficient   (Pagan    [l97],   Rosenberg [1973a, 1973b], Sarris [1973],

Cooley   and Prescott   [1973, 1976]). The most fashionable approach to

these problems has been     to apply Kalman filtering theory to the

estimation of the coefficient trajectories. The application of
filtering theory, however, requires either a priori knowledge         or

the estimation of an initial coefficient vector.
    Rosenberg [1968, 1973] was the first        to   develop an algoritlin
for conditional estimation of the initial coefficients,         and present

formulae   for the terminal period "smoothed" estimates of the
coefficients 1 His results are incomplete, however, in that they
do not contain equations for obtaining the smoothed coefficient
trajectories with their associated variance covariance matrices.
These estimates cannot be obtained from Rosenberg's analysis for
two reasons. The first is that he does not provide estimates of the
variance-covariance matrix of the initial parameters. The second,
and more important, reason is that the form of the smoothing equations
he presents are inappropriate because they rely on corrections to the
                                        —2—




filtered traj ectories which in themselves are nonexistent in the
absence of proper prior distributions for the initial coefficients.
        One approach to the starting problem is to use an empirical
Bayesian technique like that suggested by Kaminsky et al. [l97]
or Garbade [1975J.      This   approach involves selecting a subsample
of the observations and using them to      ccrnpute a prior distribution.2

This,   in turn, is used to initialize     the filter for the remaining

observations.

        The components of a theoretically complete solution to the
initialization and smoothing problems exist in the control theory
literature. The purpose        of this note is to integrate these components

and   provide   an algorithm for optiiial smoothing   which   does not require

dichotomization     of the sample. The approach is a simple one based on
a caiibination of the information filter (Fraser [1967]) and the two
filter    interpretations of the smoother     (Fraser and Potter [1968]).

2.    THE OPTIMAL SMOOTHING ALGORITIThI

        The time varying coefficient problem is characterized by a
regression equation
(1)

and   an equation describing the evolution of the coefficients over time

The variables y and x represent the observables of the system,            is a
KxK matrix which governs the transitions of the 1< component parameter
vector .      The   disturbances e and u are independently arid identically

                        The problem is to obtain estimates of the

        Information Filters
        We   now   let               and            be the   variance-covariance     matrices
before and after making an                  observation (the "predicted" and "corrected"

matrices) arid       define        the corresponding         "infor,ntion"    matrices Mt,ti
and Mt,t =                       Finally,    define   the    forward   information   variables

()                           =
                                 Mt,t 1 bt,t1

which play the role of the estimates in the information                          form of the
filter. Estimation proceeds by assuming a diffuse prior distribution

for   the      '5,   expressed          by initializing      the   problem with

                         =   0   arid f110     0.

        The Optimal    Smoother

         It   is clear that   in   econometric applications interest should focus
on the most efficient estimates of the parameters           which   use all of the
information available. These are the smoothed estimates, bIT, arid
                                       —5—

       The   algorithm outlined above provides the best estinates of the
parameter trajectories and their     associated variances, without resorting

to empirical Bayesian procedures. It also is equally applicable when a

proper prior distribution is specified since then one merely sets M,P0

and f110M110 b110.

1. Smoothed estimates are     those   which use all of the information in the

     sample   to estisn-te the coefficient at each point in time.

2. If the transition and covariance parameters of the underlying
     coefficient process are Jiown, the empirical Bayes approach has
     computational advantages. This, however, is unlikely to be the
     case in most applications.

3.   Equation (6) has   appeared in the literature in slightly different
     form:
                       - Mt_i -l +
              Dt,                  M_i) (_l)
     This    has led some people to the conclusion that the information form
     of the filter cannot accomodate singular Q matrices. A similar
     observation applies to equation (12).
