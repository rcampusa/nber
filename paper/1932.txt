        This paper presents and interprets some rw evidence on the validity of

 the Real Business Cycle approach to business cycle analysis. The analysis is

 conducted in the context of a nnetary business cycle model which makes

 explicit one potential link between monetary policy and real allocations.

 This model is used to interpret Granger causal relations between nominal and

 real aggregates. Perhaps the nost striking empirical finding is that money

 growth does not Granger cause output growth in          the context of several
 multivariate VARs and for various sample periods during the post war period in

 the U.S. Several possible reconciliations of this finding with both real and

monetary business cycles models are discussed.      We find that it is difficult

 to reconcile our npirical results with the view that            exogenous monetary
shocks were an important independent source of variation in output growth.

1. Introduction

    During the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in

equilibrium real business cycle theories. According to these theories, the

recurrent fluctuation in outputs, consumptions, investments, and other real

quantities- -   what   shall refer to       as the business cycle phenomenon- -   is
precisely what one should expect to emerge from industrial market economies in

which consumers and firms solve intertemporal optimum problems under

uncertainty.     Moreover, fluctuations in real quantities are attributed to

exogenous technological and taste shocks combined with various sources of

endogenous dynamics including adjustment costs, time-to-build capital goods,

and the non-time-separability of preferences (e.g., Kydland and Prescott

(1982), Long and Plosser (1983), Kydland (1984), and Prescott (1986)). Common

characteristics of these models are that there is a complete set of contingent

claims to future goods and services, agents have common information sets, and

the only "frictions" in the economy are the to technological factors. In

particular, real business cycle (RBC) uDdels abstract entirely from monetary

considerations and the fact that exchange in modern economies occurs via the

use of fiat money.

    There are two interpretations of this modeling strategy.            The first

interpretation is that monetary institutions and monetary policy are assumed

to be inherently neutral in the sense that real allocations are invariant to

innovations in financial arrangements and nDnetary policy. Money is a veil

regardless of how much the veil flutters. The second interpretation is that

the market organizations and the nature of monetary policy in the sample

period being examined are such as that an RBC model provides an accurate

characterization of the real economy.       Under this interpretation RBC models




                                        2
may be useful frameworks for examining the determination of real allocations

for certain institutional environments and     classes of monetary policies.

Money may be a veil as long as the veil does not flutter too much.    In   our

view, proponents of RBC theories are rt claiming that monetary policy cannot

or has never had a significant impact on the fluctuation of real output,

investment, or consumptions. Rather we subscribe to the second interpretation

of RBC analyses as investigations of real allocations under the assumption

that, to a good approximation, monetary policy shocks have played an
insignificant role in determining the behavior of real variables.

    The assumption in equilibrium RBC models that monetary shocks have not

been an important source of aggregate fluctuations is similar to the basic

premise of certain early Keynesian ndels.        According to these nodels,

interest rates affected at most long-lived fixed investments, so the interest

elasticity of aggregate demand was perceived as being low.    Furthermore, the

principal shocks impinging on the economy had their direct effects on

aggregate demand.   In particular, investment was thought to be influenced

capriciously by "animal spirits." Thus, aggregate fluctuation was associated

primarily with real shocks.   Indeed, the economic environment was assumed to

be such that changes in the money supply (both systematic and current updated

shocks) had small impacts on real economic activity.    The latter feature of

these models led to the conclusion that fiscal policy was preferred to

monetary policy for stabilizing output fluctuation.

    More recent Keynesian-style models share some common features with both

early Keynesian and equilibrium RBC models, lxi.t they are also fundamentally

different in several important respects.      Proponents of modern Keynesian

models often argue that monetary policy shocks have not been a significant




                                      3
source of "instabilityt' in the U.S. economy.      For cample Modigliani (1977,

p.12) states that ".   .there   is ro basis for the nrnetarists' suggestion that

our post war instability can be traced to nonetary instability.. .".     Thus on

this feature of the economy, proponents of modern Keynesian models and of

equilibrium RBC theories are often in agreement.

    However, for at least two reasons, it would be misleading to argue that

equilibrium RBC models and Keynesian models are simply different versions of

business cycle models in which only (or primarily) real shocks matter for

fluctuations in real quantities. First, the propogation mechanisms by which

exogenous shocks impinge on the endogenous variables are typically very

different in the tvo classes of nr,dels.        As noted above, equilibrium RBC

models focus on such technological frictions as gestation lags in building

capital or intertemporal nonseparability of preferences in generating
endogenous sources of dynamics. Contingent claims markets are assumed to be

complete and goods and asset prices adjust freely in competitive markets.     In

contrast, Keynesian models typically emphasize various frictions that prevent

perfectly flexible goods prices and wages (e.g., Modigliani 1958, Taylor

1980).   The sources of these rigidities may be frictions associated with

incomplete markets, contractual arrangements, or imperfect competition among

firms.   These differences in propogation mechanisms may imply very different

reactions of the equilibrium RBC and Keynesian economies to the same type of

shock.

    Second, and closely related to this first consideration, the potential

roles for stabilization in these economic environments may be very different.

The inflexible prices and incomplete markets in Keynesian models have been

used to justify activist fiscal and nonetary policies designed to stabilize




                                         4
output fluctuation. Of particular relevance for our analysis is the important

role often attributed to monetary policy in affecting the cyclical behavior of

real variables in Keynesian nodels. While exogenous nonetary policy shocks

may not be important sources of aggregate fluctuations, activist monetary

policies are often deemed to have had significant effects on the propogation

of nonmonetary shocks.    Hence, though the sources of uncertainty may be real,

it seems clear that noney plays a central role in nodern Keynesian nDdels.

This interpretation of modern Keynesian models was made explicitly by

Modigliani (1977, p.1): "Milton Friedman was once quoted as saying 'We are all

Keynesians, now,     and I am quite prepared to reciprocate that we are all

monetarists      if by nonetarism is nant assigning to the stock of noney a

major role in determining output and prices".

    In contrast, equilibrium RBC models typically assume that there is a

complete set of contingent claims markets and that prices are perfectly

flexible.     One implication of these assumptions in the models that have been

examined to date is that real allocations are Pareto optimal. This, in turn,

implies that there is rx       role for a central policy authority.        Thus,

equilibrium RBC theories assume both that exogenous monetary shocks have not

been an important source of fluctuations, and that the policy rules followed

by the monetary authorities have not had an important role in propogating

nonmonetary shocks. For only under this joint hypothesis does it seem likely

that an equilibrium RBC model would accurately characterize the economy.

    This paper presents and interprets some rw evidence on the validity of

the RBC proach to business cycle analysis.       Particular attention in given

to: (1) the question of whether monetary policy shocks were an important

determinant of real economic activity during the post war period, and (2)




                                        5
 several potentially important pitfalls in interpreting the available evidence

as supporting or refuting the validity of RBC models.       The analysis of the

first question bears on the validity of any business cycle model that assumes

such shocks have been important.        Certain aspects of our findings can be

viewed as being consistent with both early Keynesian and equilibrium RBC

models. However, the extreme assumptions that underlie the former models have

been largely rejected in the recent literature (see, e.g., Modigliani l977).1

Accordingly, in discussing potential interpretations of our empirical findings

we shall focus primarily on the properties of what we call equilibrium
business cycles models- -   monetary and nonmonetary models that are specified at
the level of preferences and technology. This allows us to address directly

the strengths and weaknesses of equilibrium RBC models as explanations of

fluctuations in the U.S. economy during the post war period.

    To date, empirical investigations of RBC models have typically proceeded

by fitting these models to the data arid evaluating the extent to which the

cycles implied by the models match those exhibited by the data.        Virtually
without exception, studies of RBC models have rxt considered explicitly the

conditions under which RBC models emerge approximately or exactly as special

cases of monetary models of the business cycle. In contrast, we begin our

analysis in Section 3 by setting forth an explicit monetary business cycle

model. The presentation of this model serves three purposes.      First, we are

able to make precise one potential link between monetary policy actions and

real allocations in an equilibrium model. Money matters in this model because

agents face a cash-in-advance constraint. Therefore the money-output linkages

in our model are very iaich in the spirit of those in the recent models of

Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1984), Townsend (1982), and Svensson (1985) among




                                        6
others. Within the context of this model, we provide sufficient conditions for

an RBC ndel to provide an accurate characterization of real fluctuation in

the monetary economy. The conditions discussed are, of course, specific to the

model examined. Nevertheless, we feel they are suggestive of the type of

strong restrictions on rxnetary policy rules that will be required for RBC

models to accurately approximate other, more complicated, monetary models.

    Second, we use this nodel to interpret Granger causal relations between

nominal and real aggregates. Anticipating our results in Sections 4 and 5, we

find little npirical support for the proposition that noney growth or

inflation Granger cause output growth. Interpreted within the context of the

monetary nDdel of Section 3, these results suggest that exogenous shocks to

the monetary growth rate were not an important independent source of variation

in output growth during the post war period in the U.S.      Admittedly, this

conclusion emerges from considering a model with very simple specifications of

the production, nonetary exchange technologies as well as a specific market

structure. However, introducing more complicated market structures that lead

to sticky prices and wages as in Fischer (1977) or overlapping nominal

contracts as in Taylor (1980) would only increase the complexity of the

interaction between monetary growth and real economic activity. This added

complexity vuld make it more difficult to reconcile the thsence of Granger

causality of output growth by monetary growth with the belief that exogenous

monetary policy shocks were an important source of variation in output. More

generally, our npirical evidence suggests that nonetary nodels ich imply

that money growth rates Granger cause output growth are inconsistent with post

war U.S. data.

    Third, for certain nonetary policy rules, our monetary model implies that




                                      7
the failure to find Granger causality from money to output is not sufficient

for i   RBC   model to accurately characterize the economic aivironment.   More

precisely, we argue that even if real shocks are the predominant source of

variation in real quantities over the cycle, one may be seriously misled using

an RBC model to evaluate the implications of alternative government policies.

Essentially, nDnetary feedback policies can be set in a nanner that affects

the time series properties of output even though exogenous monetary shocks are

not important determinants of output. This may be true even though RBC models

appear to fit the data for the sample period by the usual criteria.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a

brief review of the literature on equilibrium RBC models, and our equilibrium

monetary business cycle model is presented in Section 3.     In Section 4, the

laws of motion for the quantity variables implied by an RBC model are compared

to those of the nnetary model. These two nodels are used to friterpret

bivariate vector autoregressive representations (VARs) of noney and output. A

more extensive set of empirical results are presented in Section 5.   "Variance

decompositions" for output are displayed for several inultivariate time series

models of output, monetary growth, inflation, and asset returns.      Concluding

remarks are presented in Section 6,

2. Overview of Equilibrium Business Cycle Models

    A primary goal of business cycle analysis is to explain the recurrent

fluctuations of real aggregate economic quantities about their trends and the

co-movements among different aggregate economic time series. A key assumption

of real business cycle theories is that monetary policy actions are

unimportant for explaining either the amplitude or frequency        of business

cycles. In the words of King and Plosser (1984), RBC theories view "business

cycles as   arising   from variations in the real opportunities of the private

economy, which include shifts hi government purchases or tax rates as well as

technical and environmental conditions (p.363)." In this section we briefly

summarize some of the sources of variations in private market economies that

have received the most attention in the literature on RBC models.

    In modeling aggregate fluctuations, RBC theorists        often distinguish

between the exogenous sources of uncertainty impinging on economic decisions

and the endogenous propagation mechanisms for the exogenous shocks. Adopting

this taxonomy, we shall consider, first, the various exogenous sources of

uncertainty that have typically been emphasized in the recent literature.    In

modern economies, many types of shocks impinge on the decisions of agents in

different sectors.     For the purpose of aggregate business cycle analyses, it

is typically assumed implicitly or explicitly that idiosyncratic sector or

agent-specific shocks "average out" and have no effect on aggregate

quantities.    On the other hand, the common components of individual shocks

that remain after aggregation are interpreted as the aggregate sources of

uncertainty in business cycle models. The number of these aggregate
disturbances is typically assumed to be small; often the number does not

exceed the number of real quantity variables appearing in the model.




                                        9
    Furthermore, when using RBC models to describe economic data, attention

has been restricted almost exclusively to exogenous shifts in the production

technologies of goods.   See, for example, Kydland and Prescott (1982), thng

and Plosser (1983), King and Plosser (1984), Altug (1985), and Hansen (1985).

Notably absent from these models are aggregate shocks to preferences and to

the fiscal policy rules of governments. The omission of shocks to preferences

seems to be simply a matter of taste.     Apparently, an implicit assumption in

many of the RBC theories is that large technology shocks are more likely than

large aggregate stochastic shifts in tastes.      We relax this assumption in

constructing our illustrative monetary and real business cycle models in

Sections 3 and 4.

    The absence of shocks to government purchases or tax rates can be

explained by the nature of the models that have been developed to date.

Kydland and Prescott (1982), and many others since them, have examined

economies in which there is a complete set of markets for contingent claims to

future goods, there is m private information, and there are no public goods.

Therefore, real allocations are Pareto optimal in these economies and there is

no welfare improving role for a central government. The absence of incomplete

insurance and market failures from these models can in part be attributed to

the difficulties involved in analyzing aggregate fluctuations in general

equilibrium when such "frictions" are present.   However, in some cases, their

absence also seems to be a manifestation of the belief that aggregate

fluctuation in output that approximates that observed historically can be

generated by equilibrium models without introducing these frictions. Long and

Plosser (1983), for example, state, regarding their model, 'We believe that

major features of observed business cycles typically will be found in the kind




                                     10
of model economy outlined above (p.42).'t A similar view has recently been

expressed by Prescott (1986): "Given the people's ability and willingness to

inter- and intra-temporally substitute consumption and leisure and given the

nature of the changing production set, there would be a puzzle if the American

economy did not display the business cycle phenomena. By display the business

cycle phenomena, I mean that the amplitudes of fluctuations of the key

economic aggregates and their serial correlation properties are close to that

predicted by theory (p. 1)."

    Although RBC models have relied on unobserved technology shocks to induce

fluctuations in output, investment, consumptions, and hours worked, these

models typically adopt quite parsimonious time series representations of these

shocks.   Parsimony is important if these imdels are to have refutable

implications.   It has long been known that low order stochastic difference

equations can generate recurring irregular cyclical fluctuations not unlike

those exhibited by aggregate time series. Thus, the covariograin of a given set

of variables implied by a model can be matched to the sample covariagram of

the data by specifying sufficiently rich laws of ntion for the unobserved

shocks in a model.      But it is clear that profligately parameterized

specifications of unobserved shock processes do rt yield interesting

explanations of business cycles.       RBC nodels lead to overidentifying

restrictions on the autocovariance functions by allowing for only a small

number of shocks with parsimonious time series representations.           More

complicated patterns of autocorrelations and patterns of cross-correlations

among the variables are then induced by endogenous sources of dynamics. It is

these endogenous sources of dynamics (what King and Plosser (1985) refer to as

the propagation mechanisms)    that are the centerpieces of equilibrium RBC




                                      11
theories.

    To date, RBC theorists have stressed the role of technology and agents'

preferences in magnifying the response of economic systems to exogenous

impulses. For example, Kydland and Prescott (1982) assume that it takes time

to build capital goods (i.e., more than one period or decision interval).

This time-to-build technology has an important effect on the time series

properties of investment and output. They also assume that consumers' utility

from leisure in the current period depends on past leisure decisions.

Specifically, the marginal utility of an additional unit of leisure today is

larger (smaller) the smaller (larger) is the amount of leisure consumed in

previous periods.      This specification of preferences leads to substantially

more intertemporal substitution of leisure than the comparable time-separable

specification of preferences.      Since hours worked are more sensitive to a

given change in the real wage rate with this specification of preferences,

they are better able to capture the fluctuation in aggregate hours than the

corresponding model with time-separable utility.     ISeverthe1ess, their model

falls short of providing an adequate explanation of the time series behavior

of hours worked.    Efforts are currently underway to enrich the specification

of the labor market in their nodel in an attempt to improve the fit of the

model (Hansen 1985).

   Although the nodels examined by Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Kydland

(1984) fail to fully explain fluctuation in hours worked, it is nevertheless

striking that they do so well in attempting to replicate the time series

behavior of several of the economic aggregates considered. As the authors

emphasize, their results are certainly encouraging for they show that fairly

simple dynamic equilibrium models are capable of generating the types of




                                        12
cycles that are similar to those that have been observed historically.

Moreover, these examples provide a useful reminder of the fact that

fluctuation in real quantities per se need not           reduce social welfare; real
allocations are Pareto optimal in their model.

    Those economists who believe firmly that monetary fluctuations and the

actions of the nDnetary authority are central to an understanding of business

cycles may be inclined to dismiss these nodels outright because of their

omission of monetary considerations. Yet there seems to be both indirect and

direct evidence that such a dismissal is difficult to support.                Indirect

evidence is provided by Kydland and Prescott (1982), Long and Plosser (1983),

and Kydland (1984), among        others.        These authors have shown that, for

plausible values of the parameters characterizing preferences and technology,

the variances of the shocks to technology can be chosen such that equilibrium

RBC models imply     empirical   second moments for certain real aggregates that

approximately match the corresponding sample second moments.

    More formal evidence is provided in the             provocative   studies by Sims

(l980a, l980b).     He found that nonetary shocks had little explanatory power

for industrial production during        the post    World War II period, when    lagged
values of industrial production and nominal interest rates were included.

Sims interpreted the contribution of nominal interest rates in predicting

industrial production as capturing expectations about the future productivity

of capital, which is wry much in the spirit of real business cycle analysis.

Litterman    and Weiss   (1985) corroborate Sims' findings and        also give an RBC
interpretation    to their findings.

    The models considered by Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long and           Plosser
(1983) are    representative   agent   nodels   with complete markets so that credit




                                           13
does not enter prominently in the determination of real quantities. King and

Plosser (1984) have discussed an extended version of an equilibrium RBC model

in which there is a role for organized credit markets. Their model can be

interpreted as a RBC model in hich certain (perhaps informational) frictions

in private markets lead to the creation of institutions that specialize in

issuing credit. King and Plosser proceed to argue that, while credit may have

an important influence on the nature of aggregate fluctuations, the actions

of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee may not be an important

independent source of fluctuations in real quantities and relative prices. As

evidence for this proposition, they rote that real tput seems to be

significantly correlated with inside money but is only weakly correlated with

outside money.

    More recently, critics of the view that RBC theories are accurate

characterizatons of the post war experience have noted that these findings are

also consistent with comparably simple business cycle models in which monetary

policy plays an important role. For instance, McCallum (1983a) has shown that

if the Federal Reserve followed an interest rate rule (or mixed interest

rate-monetary aggregate rule) for nost of the postwar period, then the

interest rate innovation in Sims' regressions may be a proxy for the

innovation in the policy rule of the Fed. For the same reasons, the analysis

by King and Plosser (1984) may not accurately capture the effects of nonetary

policy shocks on real output (McCallum 1985).

    Critics of RBC models have provided several additional challenges to the

conclusion that the RBC models studied to date explain the post war experience

in the U.S. Most of the studies purporting      provide evidence in support of

RBC models have examined only a limited set of own- and cross-correlations of




                                      14
aggregate quantity variables.   In particular, cross-correlations of relative

prices and asset returns with aggreate real quantities have typically not been

studied. There is r a priori reason hy the restrictions examined should be

given more weight than other restrictions on cross-correlations in evaluating

the performance of these models. When cross-correlations of asset returns and

output are examined there is substantially uDre evidence against PBC ndels

(see, for example, hra and Prescott (1985)). Moreover, when particular RBC

models are subjected to formal methods of estimation and inference which

incorporate a fairly comprehensive set of moment restrictions, the results are

not supportive of the models (e.g., Altug (1985), Eichenbaum, Hansen and

Singleton (1985), and Mankiw, Roteinberg and Summers (1985)).

    The acceptance or rejection of RBC nwdels must be based in part on an

assessment of the plausibility of the variances and autocorrelations of the

technology shocks..2   Kydland and Prescott (1982) take their structure of

preferences and technology as given and then termine the values of the

variances of the shocks to technology that are consistent with particular

second moments of observed variables. Prescott (1986) provides an estimate of

the standard deviation of the shock to technology in a simple growth model,

but this measure is in effect the standard error of the residual from

regressing the growth rate of output on the growth rates of capital and labor.

This measure is justified by his assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production

function defined over labor and capital and thus is clearly model dependent in

same manner that the Kydland-Prescott estimates of standard deviations were

model dependent. In a manner that attempts to account for maasurement errors,

Prescott estimates the ratio of the standard deviations of the percentage

changes in the technology shock and output to be approximately .40. It seems




                                      15
difficult to assess the plausibility of this estimate and related estimates

provided by Kydland and Prescott (1982), especially in light of the highly

aggregated nature of their models.

    Furthermore, we have little independent evidence about the absolute

magnitudes of these second moments, since the theories do not lead us to

specific sources for these disturbances.      Hamilton (1983) provides some

descriptive evidence that oil price shocks were an an important source of

aggregate fluctuations in the U.S. during the post war period. Also, Miron

(1985) argues that weather shocks are an important source of variation in

aggregate consumption.   This strategy of attempting to quantify the various

shocks impinging on the economy may yield important insights into the nature

of real shocks underlying business cycles.

    A complementary strategy is to assess anpirically the relative importance

of alternative types of shocks in the context of models that accommodate

various types of shocks.    RBC theorists have not attempted to assess the

relative importance of monetary versus technology shocks, for example.      A

comparison of the stochastic properties of these shocks may lead to more

convincing conclusions about RBC models than statements about the absolute

magnitudes of technology or preference shocks. In modelá that accommodate

monetary shocks, it would be possible to decompose the variation in output

into variation attributable to monetary and real shocks (assuming the model is

identified).   Then the theoretical problem of characterizing the classes of

economies and monetary policies for which real allocations are woll described

by RBC models could be addressed. To our knowledge, King and Plosser (1984)

have come closest to attempting such an exercise. However, they stop short of

constructing a monetary nxdel and evaluating the relative importance of




                                      16
alternative shocks. Constructing a model at a plausible level of generality

and performing these calculations is admittedly a formidable task. Recent work

is just beginning to provide the necessary tools needed to solve for the

stochastic equilibria of monetary nde1s (e.g., Lucas and Stokey 1984).

Nevertheless, simple illustrative monetary models can be constructed, and it

is this task to which we turn next.

3. An Equilibrium Business Cycle Model

        In this section we present an equilibrium business cycle model and discuss

some of its properties.         The model is of a     monetary economy in which

anticipated nxrnetary growth has real economic effects. Money is introduced

into the nxdel using the construct of a cash-in-advance constraint and this

constraint is the only source of nonetary nonneutrality in this ndel. In

particular, we abstract from frictions that might lead to sticky prices or

wages and agents are assumed to have rational expectations. The exclusion of

these and other sources of frictions from the economic environment should not

be interpreted as rcessarily reflecting a view that other frictions are
absent from nodern economies.      Rather, we are intentionally constructing an

economic model that is simple to analyze and which allows us to discuss

several pitfalls in interpreting the time series evidence that purportedly

supports or refutes RBC nDdels, Many of our observations are valid for a much

larger class of real and monetary models than those examined explicitly.

    The monetary business cycle model which we consider is an extended version

of the RBC model discussed by Garber and King (1983) (which is closely related

to the model in Long and Plosser (1983)).        Suppose that a representative,

competitive firm produces a nondurable consumption good Yt using the input Xt.

The production function for Yt is given by


(3.1)       yt—xAt,

where ) is a shock to the consumption good technology at date t.             The

intermediate good Xt depreciates at the rate of 100% when used in production.

The firm buys Xt from consumers in a competitive market at the unit real price

of wt. Acquisitions of the input are made so as to maximize the expected




                                         18
discounted value of future profits. For our model, this optimum problem

simplifies to the following static optimum problem: at each date t the firm

chooses xt to maximize


(3.2)      xt t -    Wt Xt.


Profits of the firm are returned each period to the shareholders in the form

of dividends, dt.

    The intermediate good, xt, is storable. The representative consumer has an

initial endowment of the intermediate good of k0. The law of motion for the

consumer's holdings of the intermediate good at the beginning of period t is

given by


(3.3)      kt =   e [kt1   -
                               xtiJ.
In (3.3), e represents a stochastic shock to the storage technology.

    In addition to holdings of the intermediate good, the wealth of the

representative consumer includes holdings of claims to the future cash flows

of the firm and money holdings. We shall let zt denote the number of shares in

the firm held by the consumer and q (Q) denote the ex-dividend real (money)

price per share in the firm.

    There are a variety of ways in which to generate valued fiat money in

theoretical models (see, e.g., the volume edited by Kareken and Wallace

(1980)). Following Lucas (1980,1984), Townsend (1982), Lucas and Stokey

(1984), and Svensson (1985), we adopt the construct of a cash-in-advance

constraint.       While this construct is known   to   have some undesirable

characteristics, it is analytically convenient and can be interpreted as

arising from a very special shopping time technology (e.g., McCallurn 1983b).

The timing conventions for monetary transactions in this economy are assumed


                                       19
to be as follows.         The consumer enters the period t with a predetermined cash

balance Mt, and a predetermined share, zt, of claims to the dividends of the

representative firm. He learns the realizations of all time t random variables

and then chooses the quantity of intermediate goods (xt) to sell to the firm

and the amount of consumption goods (ct) to purchase at the dollar price 't.

Payment for the sale of xt to the firm is received in cash after the

consumption decision. Therefore, the money received (if any)         cannot be used

to relax the cash-in-advance constraint in period t. It follows that goods

purchases must obey the cash-in-advance constraint


(3.4)    Pt Ct      Mt.


After the goods market is closed, the consumer receives in cash his share of

dividends, Dtzt, 'where Dt is the money value of dividends at date t.            In

addition, the consumer receives a lump sum monetary transfer from the policy

authority in the amount t. Finally, at the end of period t, money and equity

shares in the firm are traded.           Thus, the evolution of the nominal money

holdings by the consumer are described by the equation


(3.5)    Mt÷1 + Qzt+i         [Mt -   Ptct] + [Q + D]z +       +


where W is the per unit cash payment from the firm to the consumer for

supplying the intermediate good. Dividing both sides of (3.4) and (3,5) by P

yields the real relations


(3.6)   Mt÷1/Pt + qz1 [mt - Ct] ÷ [q + dtjzt + WtXt +

(3.7)   Ct   nit,


where lower case letters denote real quantities and rt-Jt/Pt. We shall



                                           20
henceforth assume that the constraint (3.7) is always binding. The consistency

of this assumption with the specification of other aspects of the model will

discussed subsequent to deriving the equilibrium law of motion for xt.

     The consumer is assumed to choose contingency plans for Ct, xt, Mt+1 and

zt+l so as to maximize the logarithmic intertemporal objective function


(3.8) E0t Vt Thct,

subject to the constraints (3.3) and



(3.9)     Mt+1/Pt + qz÷1 —      [q +   dt]zt + WtXt + rt.


In   (3.8), Et denotes the expectation conditioned on agents' information set at

date t and the disturbance Vt is a taste shock, which is assumed to follow

the process


(3.10)     Vt —             IaIl,

where £net is normally distributed with mean zero and variance a.

     The firstorder conditions for this optimum problem are



(3.11) Et             +          — 0,


(3,12)     -wt.t +   Et(wt+1 8t÷ et+i) — 0,

(3.13) -qt + Ett+i (q÷1 + dt+i)) — 0,

where t is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint (3.9).

Substituting (3.11) into (3.12) gives


(3.14)     Et(Wt Vt÷i/Mt+i) —   Et(fl W.1 Vt+2 e÷1/M÷2).



                                           21
Using (3.4), an equivalent way of writing (3.14) is


                 [ W-            1—      [8    e+ Lif.+2
(
                                         I  t+2 Ct+2

which has the following interpretation. By selling a unit of the intermediate

good to the firm at date t the consumer receives W dollars, which can be used

to acquire the consumption good at date t+1. Therefore, the benefits from

providing xt are evaluated using the marginal utility of consumption at date

t+l (vt+i/ct÷i). On the other hand, postponement of the sale of x for one

periods yields the physical rate of return of                       from storage. At date t-i-l

the consumer can then sell x for e+1 Wt+1 dollars, and these dollars can be

used to purchase consumption goods at date t÷2. Equation (3.14') states that

in equilibrium the consumer is indifferent between these two strategies.

Notice that the timing convention of our model implies that, in supplying the

intermediate       good to the firm at date t for a per unit nominal price W
consumers are effectively contracting for an uncertain per unit                 real   price of
          at    date t+l.

      Equation    (3.14)    can      be used to determine    the equilibrium law of motion for

xt, once a money supply rule has been specified.                    We assume that Mt follows

the   process

(3.15)     Mt÷l         Mt (t),

where St is a vector of state variables that are known at date t. (Recall that

Mt÷1 is known at the end of date t &id Mt is determined at date t-l.)

Substituting (3.15) into (3.14) and using the cash-in-advance constraint leads

to


(                 .1   Wt- V1-                  wt-+, e÷1

                                                   22
    In equilibrium, Zt                 1    (all equity claims are held) and Ct             =   Yt
(consumption equals output). Also, the first-order conditions to the firm's

optimum problem imply that the real price of the intermediate good equals the

marginal product of the good in production:

                       a—i
(3.17)   Wt   —   a   xt t•

Imposing these equilibrium conditions and using (3.16) gives

" l E•' 11÷               1       E    I P e.+1 v+2
                      f(s)J             I          (t+1)
Given that f(st) is               in agents'           information set at date        t,   it   is

straightforward to verify that


(3.19) x — 48 exp[½a6]

                                                   e   f(st1)/f(st)


satisfies (3.18). Therefore, (3.19) is the equilibrium law of motion for x.

Taking logarithms of both sides of (3,19) gives


(3.20)   ioXt                 2n[fl 4'      Xt.,i e]     + (1nf(st,,) -   2nf(st)).

More general linear time              series      representations for 2nvt could easily be

accommodated; they would only complicate the manner in which preference shocks

enter (3.20).

    Before proceeding with our discussion of (3.20),                      it is instructive to

discuss briefly whether the assumption that the cash-in-advance constraint is

always binding is consistent with our assumptions about the distributions of

the exogenous shocks.             In the context of our model, the cash-in-advance

constraint is binding if and only if the nominal interest rate on a one-period

pure discount bond that pays off one cbllar is positive.                     Thus, to check for



                                                    23
consistency e nust verify that, having imposed the constraint, the rminal

rate implied by the model is in fact positive. The rate of return on a

one-period nominal bond in this environment is given by4

     b
           'ti-a f(s)         2
                        exp(-½o6)/ - 1.


In the absence of preference shocks, a necesary and sufficient condition for

r÷1 to be positive is that the growth rate of money, f(st), exceed .             We


used the growth rate of Ml as a measure of (t)        in   our empirical analysis.

Interestingly, for the sample period 1949:1 through 1983:6, this measure of

(t) exceeds .995 (a plausible value of         for monthly decision intervals) in

all but five months. More generally, the assumption that r÷1 > 0 imposes

restrictions on the joint distribution of the taste shock,         and f(st).5

    From (3.15) it is seen that the growth rate in the money supply,

(2nMt+1-1nMt), is equal to 2nf(st).        It follows that changes in the growth

rate of the money supply affect the consumer's decision rule for supplying

the intermediate good. The dependence of xt cri monetary growth, in turn,

implies that equilibrium c.ttput and dividends are also affected by monetary

policy. As is typical of models with cash-in-advance constraints, increases in

the growth rate of money decrease output. A similar property often emerges in

corresponding models in which money is introduced directly as an argument of

the agent's utility inction or through a shopping time transactions

technology. Lucas (1985) has conjectured that a positive relation between

money growth and output growth may obtain with the addition of informational

imperfections to models with cash-in-advance contraints. The qualitative

nature of the major conclusions drawn subsequently from (3.20) and our

empirical findings are not sensitive to whether the sign of the effect of

money on output in positive or negative. What is crucial is that money affect


                                          24
real activity through more than just the current innovation in money.

    Notice, that real allocations in r monetary economy are tnaffected by

permanent and proportional increases in either the level or the growth rate of

the money supply. Thus, this monetary model displays the property of super

neutrality. The result that a once and for all change in the level of the

money stock has no effect on ouput was derived in a more general setting by

Lucas (1984). The stronger result that money is super neutral will typically

not obtain in models in which consumers make non-trivial           labor supply

decisions as well as consumption decisions.

    Examination of the logarithms of (3.1), (3.17), and (3.19) reveals several

interesting characteristics of the model set forth above:


(3.21)          =   Enfl +     £nxti + (a-l)lrwt   ÷ met
                       + mnf(st1) lnf(st),
                                  -




(3.22)      2nct a2nx +


(3.23)      2nw — ma + (a-1)2rlxt +


Notice,    first of all, that output (mnct) is a function of both e (through xt)

and )...   This is an illustration of the more general principle that sectoral
shocks associated with the production of intermediate goods will have a

cumulative effect on final output.           Furthermore, if these shocks are

positively correlated, then the variance of the sum will exceed the sum of the

own variances. That the "aggregate" technological shock impinging on final

output represents such a combination of shocks may affect what is perceived to

be a plausible value for the variance of the shock to final output.

    Equations (3.2l)-(3.23) also illustrate the well known, but often ignored,




                                        25
fact that trends in the endogenous variables may be intimately related.

Simply put, this is because all of the endogenous variables are functions of

subsets of the same set of taste and technology shocks and trends enter the

model primarily through these shocks.         It turns t that many of r
statistical results using VARs are not insensitive to the assumptions about

the nature of trends in the variables examined. The sensitivity of estimates

from multivariate autoregressive representations to the method of detrending

has been noted previously by Kang (1985) and Bernanke (1985). In Section 5 we

use equations (3.2l)-(323)      to interpret the sensitivities of our results to

the specifications of trends.

   Having deduced the equilibrium laws of ution for the real quantities in

our monetary model, we turn next to an investigation of conditions under which

an RBC model provides an accurate approximation to this economy.




                                        26
4. Interpreting Bivariate VARs using Monetary and RBC Models

     As background information for comparing the properties of the monetary and

RBC models,     it is     instructive to examine some empirical evidence.

Accordingly, we begin this section with a discussion of the findings from

estimating bivariate autoregressive time series representations of output and

money growth. A much more comprehensive set of empirical results is discussed

in Section 5.

     The Granger causality relations between output and money were investigated

using monthly data for the U.S. economy over the sample period February 1949

through June 1983.      Output was measured by the Industrial Production Index

constructed by the Federal Reserve Board. Money was measured by Ml and was

obtained from the CITLBASE data tape. Table 4.1 displays the results for the

growth rate of output (the difference in the logarithm of industrial

production) arid the second difference in the logarithm of Ml.      The second

difference of the nney stock was used, because this is the empirical

counterpart to the construct appearing in the expression for Yt in Section

3,     Both Yt and 2.enM+1 were assumed to be covariance stationary

stochastic processes.     (The issue of trends is discussed in sore detail in

Section 5.) All VARs included twelve lags of each variable and a constant.

In none of the five sample periods considered does i2.2nMt÷1 Granger cause

       at the one percent level. And only in the sample period 1959,2-1983,6

does L22nMt+1 Granger cause Yt at the five percent level.          Though not

reported in Table 4.1, the corresponding results obtained with 2nMt÷1 in

place of 22nMt÷1 were virtually identical.

     These results could plausibly be interpreted as evidence in favor of the

view that RBC models provide accurate characterizations of the behavior of




                                       27
real quantity variables for this sample period.         The remainder of this

section explores ways in which this interpretation of the evidence can be

reconciled with economic theory and ways in which advocates of various models

can be misled by this evidence.    In Subsection 4.A we study a version of the

model from Section 3 in which no cash-in-advance constraint is imposed. In

addition, we deduce conditions under which real allocations from this RBC

model correspond to those in the cash-in-advance economy. Subsection 4.B

explores the possibility of REC models providing an accurate, though not

exact, approximation to the monetary economy.



4.A. An RBC Model

    Consider the following version of the economy of Section 3 in which agents

do not face a cash-in-advance constraint.       Suppose that   agents face the

period budget constraint


(4.1)   ct + q zt+i        (dt + q) z + wt xt

In this economy the consumption good is the n.uneraire and agents are paid in

consumption goods for supplying the intermediate good to the firm.    Payments

during period t are available for immediate consumption during period t. Also

suppose that the representative consumer chooses contingency plans for Ct, Xt,

and zt+i so as to maximize the logarithmic intertemporal objective ftnction

(3.8) subject to the constraints (3.3) and (4.1). In equilibrium, ztl (share

market clears), yt—ct (consumption equals output),


(4.2)   wtxt + dt —   Yt

(dividends plus factor costs exhaust output), and the supply and demand of the




                                      28
intermediate good are equilibrated, so that (3.17) holds.         Imposing these

equilibrium conditions and using arguments similar to those leading to (3.19)

yields the following laws of motion for the quantity variables:


                         2     a-i
(4.3)   xt          exp{½a] x1 vti e,
                a
(4.4)   Ct     xt At,

(4.5)   dt =   (1-a) x At,

where the last expression follows from (4.2).

    The equilibrium laws of notion for xt in the monetary and non-monetary

economies, given by (3.19)       and    (4.3)   respectively,   differ by the
multiplicative term {f(st.i)/f(st)] and the dating of the preference shock ii.

The latter difference arises because cash payments received at date t from the

sale of the intermediate good to the firm cannot be used to acquire the

consumption good until date t+1 in the monetary model.

   When will the real allocations be identical in the nonetary and
non-monetary models described above? The difference between the dating of the

preference shock in the law of motion for xt will trivially be inconsequential

if preference shocks are absent from the nDdel.      Most of the RBC nDdels that

have been studied to date do exclude preference shocks. Alternatively, if the

preference shock follows a logarithmic random walk (a-.1), then again this

shock will not appear in the law of motion for Xt. Additionally, the monetary

term in (3.19) must be zero. This will be the case if the monetary authorities

follow a constant growth rate rule. Under these circumstances, (3.19) and

(4.3) give the same equilibrium laws of motion for x. This, in turn, implies

that the real equilibrium for the real and monetary models are identical,

sine dt and Ct are proportional to xt in both economies. Given that a=l, a



                                        29
constant monetary growth rate is both rcessary and sufficient for the real

allocations to be identical in these economies.       In addition, it can be shown

that formulas for asset prices and relative prices of goods are identical in

the monetary and RBC models under these assumptions.



4.B Comparing Monetary and Real Business Cycle Models

    Now, in fact, the monetary growth rate has not been constant over the

postwar period.       In our view, this observation alone is not sufficient to

dismiss an RBC explanation of aggregate fluctuations.        The extreme case of

monetary policy having no impact on real allocations, what we will refer to as

the strong RBC hypothesis, is presumably not what most proponants of RBC

theories have in mind when arguing that RBC models fit the data.         Instead,

such claims        are more plausibly interpreted as       statements about   the

insensitivity of real allocations to the current structure of financial

institutions, and the insignificance of exogenous shocks to the money supply

relative to exogenous real shocks. We refer to this latter interpretation as

the weak RBC hypothesis. Initially we discuss conditions under which measures

of monetary growth are rt likely to Granger cause the growth rate of output

under the weak RBC hypothesis.     Then, circumstances under which moasures of

monetary growth Granger cause the growth rate of output are discussed.

    In our illustrative monetary model, the equilibrium quantities will be

approximately unaffected by exogenous money supply shocks if the change in the

growth rate of money is not too variable relative to preference and technology

shocks. Under this condition, the last term in expression (3.21),



(4.6)    .enxt —   1n +       Enxt1   ÷ (a-l)Thvt +   2ne - r1Mt+1



                                        30
can be ignored.   The corresponding expression from the RBC model set forth in

Section 4.A is


(4.7)     nxt — 2n$ +      + nxt + (a-l)lru.'t1   ÷ 2nêt.

Comparing (4.6) and (4.7) it is seen that hen      technology and taste   shocks

predominate the two laws of motion are nearly identical, the only difference

being the dating of the preference shock.   Thus, whether or not al, the RBC

model will provide a reasonably good approximation to the monetary economy

under this assumption about monetary growth.       Furthermore, for the sample

sizes typically considered in macroeconomic time series analyses, nxney may

not Granger cause output in this system due to statistical power
considerations.

      It seems difficult to reconcile the absence of Granger causality from

money to output with the opposing view that monetary policy shocks contributed

significantly to the variability of itput thring r sample        period. Within
the   model of Section 3, one such reconciliation is achieved by assuming that

22nMt÷1 is serially uncorrelated (monetary growth follows a random walk).

Then the last term in (4.6) is serially uncorrelated.       Consequently, money

will not Granger cause output in the bivariate system [&2ny2€nM÷1]. This

will be the case even though money iocks affect itput and may have a large

variance relative to real shocks. The assumption that the change in the

monetary growth rate is serially uncorrelated is counterfactual, however (see

Table 4.1).

      More generally, suppose that the monetary   growth rate is chosen by the
policy authorities to follow the process


(4.8)     AEnMt+1 —   Y £ny1 +       .Qny..2 + y3 JnMt +
                  —   (l--y3L)'[-y12ny1 + 2ny..2J + (l-i3LY'   't


                                       31
where 1731<1,      is a random shock to the policy rule in period t that is

independent of the preference and technology shocks, and L is the lag

operator.     Taking the first difference of the output equation (3.22) and

substituting (4.8) for 22nMt÷1 and ignoring constant terms gives the

following equations:


(4.9) Yt a[(a-1)2nut + 0t - (l--y3L'(-y1 Yt-i + 2 inyt2)]
                           +          -
                                          a(l--)'3L)1 bt,
(4.10)      2frMt±1 —   (l--y3L)'[1       iny..1 + 7 lny2 +

In this example, 22nMt÷1 will not Granger cause .2nyt only under the special

assumptions that --O in (4.8) and the composite shock {(a-l)2nvt + n9t +

1nAt + t] is serially uncorrelated. The assumption that the projection of

22riMt÷1 onto its own history and the past history of ny is not a function

of 21nMtj jO, is counterfactual. Also, we are not aware of any compelling

scientific evidence which strongly suggests that either the changes or levels

of the taste and technology shocks are white noise processes.

    Of course, if the variance of the monetary policy shocks are small

relative to the variances of the real shocks, then money may not Granger cause

output even though A2lnMt+j is highly variable.             In particular, suppose that

the variance of (l--y3L)1 t is small relative to the variances of the terms

involving the other shocks, so that the monetary policy shock is not an

important independent source of variation of output in this model.                Then

inspection of (3.22), (3.23), and (4.9) reveals that monetary growth may fail

to Granger cause ttput in the nulivariate system [nxt,nct,1riwt,22nMt÷1].

This scenario presumably motivates RBC analyses.

   While it is necessarily true that real shocks should be the focal point of




                                             32
business cycle analyses if monetary shocks are relatively unimportant, as the

bivariate VARs suggest, it is premature to conclude that RBC models correctly

represent the structure   of the economy. The economic environment leading to

the use of fiat money as a medium of exchange may be very different than the

economic environment underlying RBC models.    That is, modern institutional

arrangements are associated with very different market structures than the

structures adopted in RBC models and hence monetary models may have very

different sources of endogenous dynamics.

    To illustrate this point, consider again the output equation (4.9)

associated with the money supply rule (4.8). Suppose that the linear

combination of the taste and technology shocks in (4.9)           is serially

uncorrelated. The persistence in output is then due entirely to the fact that

the monetary policy rule feeds back on lagged itput growth; there is rthing

technological about this persistence.     Yet an RBC theorist might    explore

non-time-separable specifications of technology and preferences in order to

induce autocorrelations similar to those implied by (4.9).     It seems likely

that RBC models could be developed with sufficiently rich specifications of

preferences and technology to match the autocorrelations of output quite

closely. For, as noted previously, low order stochastic difference equations

are often acceptable representations of economic aggregates.    But inferences

about the structure of the economy using an RBC model could be very

misleading. It follows that policy analysis using the RBC formulation of the

economy could lead to misguided policy prescriptions.

   As a second example of this phenomenon, suppose that 21nMt÷1 is set so as

to substantially attenuate (or completely offset) the impact of certain shocks

on Yt• Then the time series properties of 2nyt will be determined by the




                                     33
remaining, shocks in (4.6) and money growth may not Granger cause output

growth.   Nevertheless, the properties of _2nyt are clearly affected by the

particular feedback rule adopted by the monetary authorities. We suspect that

a version of this scenario could be developed in which lagged values of

22nMt÷1 also were useful in predicting E2.2nMt+1.

    Up to this point    have focused on situations in which money growth does

not Granger cause output growth.   In anticipation of empirical results using

linearly detrended data reported in Section 5, we briefly explore structural

interpretations of a Granger causal relation from nney to output.    The most

straightforward interpretation of such a statistical relation is that In fact

monetary policy actions are important determinants of aggregate real activity.

On the other hand, a statistical relation between money and output may reflect

the fact that money is proxying for unobserved shocks to tastes and

technologies. That is, if there are nre aggregate shocks to preferences and

technology than real variables included in the VAR, then in general 2M

will Granger cause the real variables. This is the interpretation of

money.output correlations adopted by Litterman and Weiss (1985).

    To illustrate a signaling role for money, consider a trivariate VAR of

Yt'            and E22nMt÷1.   In our model, when a'l, there are three real

shcks so if monetary growth follows a feedback rule like (4.8), then 2nMt÷1

will convey information about [Enyt,z.2nxtJ that is rt embodied in the past

histories of the quantity variables. Thus, noney will Granger cause output in

this setting even if monetary policy shocks are absent from the model. On the

other hand, when a—l, there are only two real shocks so that the vector of

quantities will not be Granger caused by monetary growth if the variance of

the monetary shock is small.




                                     34
    In concluding this section, we examine the question of what proportion of

the variance of c1tput is accounted for by innovations in nominal aggregates.

Attempts at answering this question raise additional questions regarding the

interpretation of VARs.     We begin by describing a procedure proposed by Sims

(1980b) for calculating variance decompositions and then review an important

objection to the procedure which has been tised by Blanchard and Watson

(1984) and Bernanke (1985), among others.         These issues are intimately

connected with the set of circumstances under which Granger-causality tests

can be used to shed light on structural, rather than statistical, issues.

    Let S- [S1t', S'] , where S1 is a j x 1 vector of real variables and
S2 is a (k-j) x 1 vector of nominal variables. We suppose that S has the

vector autoregressive representation,


(4l1)        G(L)St   Et


where G(L) is a k x k matrix polynomial in the lag operator L, I + G1L + G2L2

         which satisfies the invertibility conditions, and   is a k x 1 vector

of serially uricorrelated disturbances which may be contemporaneously

correlated.      In general the elements of the vector e will be nonlinear

functions of the innovations to agents' preferences, productivity shocks and

nominal disturbances.      Suppose that the analyst estimates the parameters of

G(L) and the contemporaneous covariance of €,


(4.12)       E€t4

The analyst wishes to partition the variance of the T-step ahead forecast

error of a particular element of S into the portions attributable to

innovations in the different components of S.

    Suppose that the forecast error variance of interest is that of the first



                                        35
component of S.c, Sit. Let L1 be the 1 x k row vector with 1 in the first

place and zero elsewhere. Also let St                    M(L)€t denote the nDving average
representation of St where M(L) is a k x k matrix of polynomials in the lag

operator which satisfies the invertibility conditions and M(L)G(L) =                  I,   with

I being the k x k identity matrix. Then the T-step ahead forecast error of

S1 can be written as


(4.13)   EtSlt÷T -        Sjt+T — Ll(-€t+T   -
                                                  MlEt÷T1. .-MT1et÷l)
                                                             .




The variance of the T-step forecast error variance of S1, is equal to,

                                                 T-i k k
(4.14)   E({Sit÷T -       EtSlt÷T]2)   —
                                                                 M.(l,j) Mr(l2)cj
                                                 r—o   j—i 1—i

where M(i,j) is the th element of the matrix Mr.

    If EE is diagonal, then the percentage of the variance in the T-step

forecast of S1. due to innovations in the th variable,

(4.15)   T-ik
                      M(l,j) aj
         r—o    j—i

As T approaches infinity the T-step ahead forecast error of S converges to

the ixiconditional variance of                         Accordingly, the percentage of the

unconditional variance of S1. which is attributable to innovations in Sit is

well approximated by calculating (4.15) for large values of T.

    In general, the matrix E is rt diagonal,                           so that some set of
normalizations or identifying restrictions im.tst be imposed on the system

before a decomposition of S can be calculated.                     More precisely, we define a

new set of error terms ct



                                                 36
(4.16)     ct =       ft
with F chosen such that


(4.17)     Eetf =           FEctcF'    FçF'

and      is a k x k diagonal positive definite matrix. Then (4.6) and


(4.18)     G(L)St =   Fct


are observationally equivalent representations of St. In general there are

an infinite number of matrices F which satisfy (4.17), so normalizations must

be imposed before calculating variance decompositions.

      The sethod suggested by Sims (1980b) for decomposing the ctor 6t into

orthogonal components, (i.e., for choosing a particular matrix F) is to

proceed with a particular ordering of the elements of S and restrict

attention to the class of matrices F which are lower block triangular.            This

amounts to setting the th offdiagona1 elements of the th row of F1 equal

to minus the coefficient on            from the projection of the t1t element of t

on elements 1 through j-1 of t'(21' ..,j'l).               In general the matrix F

depends on the ordering of the variables,          Once the matrix F has been chosen

we can substitute t Fct into (4.15) to achieve the desired decomposition.

Notice that if E is diagonal then there is a unique matrix F=I which

satisfies (4,16) and (4.17).          As Sims (1980b), Blanchard and Watson (1984),

Bernanke (1985), and Cooley and LeRoy (1985) have noted this procedure for

choosing the matrix F presumes that the structural ndel for St          is   recursive

when E is not diagonal.

      In the context of the following example, we discuss the pitfalls of Sims'




                                              37
procedure when applied to our problem.                     Consider again the representation

(4.9) for Einy. Relation (4.9) implies that the innovation to the owth

rate of output will be a linear combination of the innovations to agents'

preference shocks, sector specific technology shocks, and the change in the

growth rate of money. In order to make our example as simple as possible we

concentrate on a bivariate time series representation for Yt and 22nMt+1,

and simplify the stochastic structure of the model.                   Suppose that preference

shocks follow a random walk (a—i), e-l, and the law of motion for the

technology shock is given by,

(4.19)           .inXt —      D(LY'€At,

where D(L)      1-Ld(L) is an invertible polynomial in the lag operator, d(L) =

(d1 + d2L + d3L2 + ...), and e is a serially uncorrelated random variable.
It is convenient to modify relation (4.6) by replacing the term i2ir1Mt÷1 by

zi22nMt+1 where z(O,l). When z is equal to one, we obtain the monetary model

of Section 3.     When z is equal to zero, we obtain the RBC model discussed in

Section 4.A which imposes the strong RBC hypothesis. Under these assumptions,

the law of motion for Yt becomes



(4.20) Yt —           &2nAt   -
                                  zapt


where j4t     22nMt+1. Substituting (4.19) into (42O) and rearranging gives,



(4.21)      A2nYt —   d(L)tinyt..1       -
                                             zaj   + zad(L)iit..1 +




    Next, suppose that the monetary authority sets the change in the monetary

growth rate according to the feedback rule,



                                                     38
(4.22)   it =   e(L)2nyti      + f(L),ut..i + /ht + xeAt



where e(L) and f(L) are scalar invertible polynomials in the lag operator L,

x is a scalar constant, and t is a serially uncorrelated random variable.

We assume that           and t are contemporaneously uncorrelated.

    Relations (4.21) and (4.22) imply that &2ny and j have the bivariate VAR

representation


          AnYt1           1 za d(L)          zad(L) [iny1          eitl

           't    I                                      I

where

                      lzax       -za
(4.24)           —
                      X           1


Suppose the analyst estimates the VAR (4.23) and has in hand estimates of the

three parameters of EE.         For this economic model E€ is a function of four

parameters: za, x, cr,          and a' where the last two parameters are the

variances of         and       respectively. It follows that the parameters of the

innovation covariance matrix cannot be identified separately from the

parameters of the regression equation.              This, in turn, implies that the

methods proposed by Blanchard and Watson (1984), Bernanke (1985), and Sims

(1985) for analyzing innovation covariance matrices are in general not

applicable to dynamic economic models.           Put differently, proponents of this

approach are implicitly ruling out a large and important class of dynamic

economic models as candidates for explaining business cycles.

    Pursuing this observation, suppose that the empirical evidence suggests

that A.2ny is not Granger caused by p. Within the context of (4.23), this



                                            39
implies that zcr=O unless we are in the counterfactual case where d(L) is

identically equal to f(L). Setting zO leads to the structural model



            iny    —
                       d(L)      0 [2nyt..1           1   0     xt1

                       e(L)   f(L) LAit-i             x   1


The model (4.25) has three important features.            First, it corresponds to the

RBC model of Section 4.A.          Second, this model exhibits a block recursive

structure between the real and nnetary sectors.               Third, implementing Sims'

procedure for orthogonalizing the covariance matrix of the innovations in a

bivariate VAR by placing Yt before p would uncover the true orthogonal

shocks of interest.      It is worth emphasizing that the justification for the

ordering of the variables in this example depends critically ai the assumed

pattern of Granger-causality results.             For the RBC model in Section 4.A,

imposing the Granger rxn-causality of output by money identifies                      the

parameters of the matrix           .   There      is no natural way to separate the

identification of EE from the specification of the structure in this dynamic

model.

    Recall that the findings in Table 4.1 provide little evidence that &2ny

is Granger caused by A22nM1,                Therefore, consistent with the previous

discussion, we implemented Sims procedure for decomposing the variance of

         by placing A2ny before i22nMt÷1. All of the variance decompositions

are for forty-eight month ahead forecast errors (T=48).               Table 4.1 displays

the decompositions and their associated standard errors.6 Notice that for all

the sample periods considered the innovation in 2hiMt+1 accounts for very

little of the variance of 2yt                  In four of the five sample periods

considered the percentage of the variance of lny explained by innovations to




                                             40
'Yt is within one standard error of ninety five percent. Even in the sample

period 1959,2-1983,6, where 22nMt÷1 Granger causes Qny at the five percent

level, the percentage of the variance of Jny accounted for by innovations in

Yt is within one standard error of ninety percent. Viewed as a whole, the

empirical results emerging from the bivariate time series analysis yield very

little evidence against the weak RBC hypothesis.

    In Section 5 we analyze VARs that include additional variables as a check

on the robustness of the qualitative findings from the empirical analysis of
the bivariate VARs.   In decomposing the variance of the growth rate of output

we proceed under the null hypothesis imposed by the strong RBC hypothesis that

there is a block recursive structure between real and nominal variables.




                                      41
5. Interpreting the Evidence from Vector Autoregressions

    Much of the recent empirical evidence that has been used to support or

refute RBC models has come from studying vector autoregressive or moving

average representations of the variables comprising the models. See, for

example, Sargent (1976), Sims (1980a,b), King and Plosser (1984), Altug

(1985), and Bernanke (1985). In this section we examine the empirical evidence

from multivariate VARs in light of the discussion in Section 4, using monthly

data for the postwar U.S. economy.

    At the outset of this discussion it is important to explore in detail the

role of detrending in the empirical analysis.   As noted in Section 3, several

authors have documented the sensitivity of the results from estimating

unconstrained VARs to the assumptions about trends.        At the same time,

previous studies have virtually ignored the fact that the trends are

determined both by the specification of the underlying uncertainty in the

economy and the structure of the economic model itself.     Therefore, how one

detrends is in general not independent of one's view about the structure of

the economy.   This observation represents an additional reason hy it is not

possible to embark on an empirical analysis of business cycle models using

VARs without implicitly or explicitly restricting the class of models being

investigated. We briefly illustrate the nature of these restrictions using

the models of Section 3.

   Different specifications of preferences and technologies, as well as the

laws of motion for the exogenous shocks will in general lead one to consider

different autoregressive representations of the data.     For instance, had we

started with quadratic preferences and technologies, a linear representation

of the levels of the variables, instead of their logarithms, would have




                                     42
emerged from the model. The question of whether trends are deterministic or

stochastic would then have been addressed to the levels of the variables.

Rather than working out in detail some of the many possible time series

representations that might emerge from alternative specifications of

preferences and technologies,            continue to focus on the log-linear

representation that emerges from the model in Section 3.       Even holding fixed

the specification of technology and preferences, it turns out that many

possible trend specifications may arise in our model from alternative

specifications of the structure of uncertainty.

      To see this, it is convenient to work with a special case of the monetary

model given by (4.9) and (4.10). Suppose the monetary policy rule is given by

(5.1)      22nMt      1xt1 +

There is no deep economic significance to having monetary growth depend on the

intermediate good.        This specification allows us to make cur points without

extensive    additional    calculations using alternative specifications of the

model, Substituting (5.1) into the equation (3.21) gives (ignoring constants):



(5.2)       nxt —(lp)1xt1 + (a-l)lnvt + '8t -


The     expressions (3.22) and (3.23) for 2nct and 2nwt, respectively, are
unchanged. Notice that the coefficient on             in (5.2) is determined both

by the specifications of the storage technology for the intermediate good and

the monetary feedback rule. If p<O, then Znxt will be an explosive process

and so will 2nct and 2nwt. In this case, neither the removal of a
deterministic polynomial trend or first-differencing will render the logarithm

of output stationary! Similar examples of potentially explosive processes for




                                          43
output are easily constructed by relaxing the assumption of independent taste

and technology shocks.   Also, we conjecture that an explosive output process

may well emerge in imdels with increasing returns to scale in production. For

instance, some specifications of learning-by-doing might generate such an

increasing returns to scale technology.

    If, on the other hand, 2>p>O, then the trend in 2nxt will be determined by

the properties of .2n11t1, 2net, and         For instance, if a subset of these

variables exhibit linear deterministic trends and the other variables are

stationary stochastic processes, then the logarithms of output, consumption,

and the price of the intermediate good will also exhibit linear trends. An

assumption like this nust implicitly underlie the common practice of removing

linear trends. This result depends critically on the specification (5.1) of

the money supply rule.   If p—O, then removing linear trends from [nxt, hict,

2nwt] will not render these variable stationary (see below).         It would be

necessary in this model to adopt i      entirely   different specification of the

storage technology to preserve the linear trend assumption.

    If 2>p>O and lTwt..i, 2ne,     and 2nAt are all stationary, then ny will

also be stationary. At least for the postwar period, the evidence seems not to

support this assumption about trends.

   Finally, returning to the original specification of the model, if p=O,

then there is a unit root in the process for lnxt.        If the technology shock

't also has a unit root and               and 2ne are stationary process, then

      2nc, and A2nwt are all stationary stochastic processes. This case is

of particular interest since Prescott (1986) has argued that the technology

shock in his model approximately follows a random walk.       Also, Altug (1985)

found that the estimated autoregressive parameter in her time series




                                        44
representation of the technology shock was essentially unity. Thirdly, Nelson

and Plosser (1982) have argued that many real macroeconomic time series must

be differenced to induce stationarity. In our work we consider only the

possible need to first difference output. However, the need for higher order

differencing could be justified by introducing unit roots into the lnvt or

met processes.
      With these observations in mind, we turn next to an empirical analysis of

monthly data for the postwar period. Let S' denote a k x 1 vector of

variables observed by the econometrician. In light of our previous discussion

regarding trends, we assume that             is related to the k x 1 covariance

stationary stochastic process, S, via one of the following two relations:



(5.3a) S' St + Ag(t)

or,

J.)U)      r*

where g(t) is a scalar valued deterministic function of time and A is a k x k

matri! of constants, and St has the autoregressive representation (4.11).       As


before, we partition the vector S as,



(5.4)      S' —   {5t'    S2t']



where S1 is a j x 1 vector of real quantity variables and t       is   a (k-j) x 1

vector of relative prices and nominal variables.

      Initially, we address the question of thether nominal aggregates have

predictive power for aggregate real output, once lagged outputs are accounted




                                        45
for.     Trivariate VAR's including measures of aggregate real output, the rate

of inflation, and the stock of money were examined. That is,



(5.5)       S*' [ny, itt, £nMt+i]


where itt denotes the rate of inflation between time t-l and time   t.   (Recall

that Mt+j is chosen at date t.) Similar VARs were studied by Sims (1980a) and

Litterman and Weiss (1985).      In order to allow comparisons with the latter

study,    the   components of S' were taken to be nonthly versions of the data

used by Litterman and Weiss (1985) over the sample period 1949,2-1983,6.     The

variable y was nasured as the industrial production, Mt+1 s nEasured as

Ml, and itt was measured as the monthly change in the logarithm of the consumer

price index less shelter.      Seasonally adjusted versions of the noney, price

and output series were used.

       It is worth pointing out that Sims (1980a) and Litterman and Weiss (1985)

estimated their VARs using levels of variables. Sims (1980a) does not discuss

the trend issue, while Litterman and Weiss (1985) note that their findings are

largely insensitive to whether or not linear trends are removed.           Their

approach amounts to running a VAR using data on S rather than St. Here        we

investigate the sensitivity of Litterman and Weiss' Granger-causality findings

to both changes in the sample period, and the removal of linear deterministic

trends or first-differencing the data.

       Five sample periods     were considered: 1949,2-1983,6, 1952,1-1979,12,

1952,1-1983,6, 1959,2-1979,12 and 1959,2-1983,6. All VARs included twelve

lagged values of each variable and a constant. Table 5.1 displays the test

results for the null hypotheses that the coefficients on lagged values of itt




                                         46
and £nMt (H7. and Hm, respectively) are zero in the context of the trivariate

VAR for S' (equation (5.5)).    The null hypothesis } is rejected at the one

percent level for the sample periods 1949,2-1983,6 and 1959,2-1983,6, but not

for the other three sample periods. The null hypothesis H. is rejected at the

one percent level cnly for the period 1959,2-1979,12. There is substantially

more evidence against the rull hypothesis HM at the five percent level; HM is

rejected at this level for all five sample periods.

    Table 5.2 reports the corresponding tests for kiy with S* given by
(5.3a). The matrix A was chosen to be the 3 x 3 identity matrix, and the

function g(t) was given by



(5.6)    g(t) — a + bt



Thus the inputs into the VAR were the linearly detrended values of .EnYt, itt

and hlMt.fl, denoted by 2ny, ir, and nM1, respectively. Let H(H) denote
the null hypothesis that the coefficients on lagged values of .2nM+1 (itt') in

the iny' equation are zero, Interestingly, the strongest evidence against H

comes from the post-1959 sample periods.       For these sub-periods, } is

rejected at the one percent level. The null hypothesis H is not rejected at

the five percent significance level for any of the subperiods.

    The results of Table 5.2 are based on a decomposition of the movements in

S into secular and cyclical components.     Secular movements ere modeled as

deterministic functions of time. A number of authors like Nelson and Plosser

(1982) have argued, on statistical grounds, that many macroeconomic time

series display stochastic rather then deterministic time trends.    Given the

weak power of existing statistical tests for detecting the presence of unit




                                      47
roots in time series processes, it is not clear that these issues can be

settled on purely statistical grounds (see for example the discussion of

Nelson and Plosser (1982) in McCallum (1985)). However, we are sympathetic to

the possibility that a variety of aggregate time series are members of what

Nelson and Plosser (1982) call the class of difference stationary stochastic

processes. Moreover, several of the models in Section 3 and 4 are consistent

with the presence of a unit root in the autoregressive component of the time

series representation for the logarithm of real .1tput.         Therefore, we

re-estimated the trivariate VARs allowing for the possibility that the data

display stochastic trends.    However no attempt as made to decompose the

movements in real output (or the other components of St*) into secular and

cyclical components.   This is because we did not wish to impose the a priori

restriction that rxinina1 disturbances affect only the cyclical component of

real output.

    Table 5.3 displays the results from testing the null hypotheses that the

coefficients on lagged values of inMt÷1 and t      in the ny equation (H
and H, respectively) are zero.      The trivariate VARs were estimated using

observations on S with St and S* related via (5.3b),         The matrix A was

chosen to be the 3 x 3 identity matrix so that S. is simply equal to        A

striking feature of the results is that neither H or H is rejected at the

five percent level for any of the postwar sample periods. These results stand

in sharp contrast to those reported in Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

    To summarize this portion of our empirical analysis, the test results were

most sensitive to changes in the sample period when the VARs were estimated

using data which were not detrended in any way (as in Sims (1980a) and

Litterman and Weiss (1985)) and least sensitive when the VAR's were estimated




                                     48
using first differenced data. In addition, the strongest evidence against the

null hypothesis that real output is exogenous with respect to measures of

inflation and the stock of nney was obtained 'when the VARs were estimated

using data 'which was not detrended.    There is r evidence against this null

hypothesis from VARs estimated using first-differenced data.

    Next, we examine the consequences of adding asset returns to the joint

time series representation for output, inflation and money. Sims (1980a) and

Litterman and Weiss (1985) report that the role of money in VARs is very

sensitive to the inclusion of rates of return on Treasury bill securities.

For this reason, several VARs which included the ex post real value-weighted

return on stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, r, and the ex post

real rate of return on one nrrnth Treasury bills, t, were estimated.      Real

rates of return were studied instead of nominal returns, because the nominal

rate of return on Treasury bills, R, displays a narked trend in the post war

period. This trend is far less pronounced for the real rate of return, r'.

    The reasons for including stock returns in the empirical analysis are

three-fold. First, we are sympathetic with the opinion of Fischer and Merton

(1984) that macroeconomists have unduly neglected the role of the stock market

as a determinant of aggregate output.       Second, there are good theoretical

reasons to believe that stock returns are useful statistical predictors of

real output.   Changes in stock prices reflect both revised expectations about

future corporate earnings and revisions in the discount rate at 'which these

expected earnings are capitalized. Revisions in both of these variables may

be induced by the shocks impinging on output. Third, a number of authors

including Doan, Litterman and Sims (1983), report that stock returns are, in

fact, important indicators of movements in real output.




                                       49
    In estimating the VARs with asset returns, attention was restricted to the

post 1959 period, because Tables 5.1 and 5.2 suggest that this period was the

least likely to be consistent with RBC theories.    Table 5.4 reports results

from four-variate VARs including           r,        nMt+1) and (2nyt, r,
     't+). In neither of the two sample periods can we reject at the five

percent level the null hypotheses H, H, or H. However, the rull
hypothesis HrS can be rejected at the one percent level for the period

1959,2-1979,12.



                                   t'
    Table 5.5 displays the results from four-variate VARs including (.Enyt',

r, t' lnMt+11) and (lnyt', r                       Somewhat surprisingly, only

lagged values of iny helped predict future values of 2ny for the sample

periods examined.

    Table 5.6 displays results from five-variate VARs including (Li.2nyt, r,

r, 1rt, £2nMt+1) and (.2nyt',r, r t' £n14+1). Only lagged values of inyt

help predict future values of 2yt at the one percent level. Similarly, only

lagged values of £nyt' help predict frLyt' at the one percent level.   However

there is some evidence that ex post real stock returns have predictive power

for both .2nyt and inyt' in the period 1959,2-1979,12. As with the trivariate

VARs, there is somewhat more evidence that nominal aggregates help predict

real variables when detrended data are used, but overall there is very little

evidence of predictive power for nominal variables.       Finally, Table 5.7

reports our results when real rates of return were replaced by first
differences of nominal rates of return and linearly detrended nominal returns.

The qualitative conclusions from these tests are essentially the same as those

from using real returns.

   The runs with differenced data provide little support for the view that




                                     50
monetary policy actions were important determinants of real txltput over the

sample periods considered.    The absence of Granger causality from money to

output suggests that exogenous policy shocks were not a major source of output

variability.     Overall, the pattern of results from the VARs are not

inconsistent with an RBC interpretation of the post war aggregate time series

data.

    There is perhaps one puzzling feature of these results.   Recall from the

discussion in Section 4.B that nDnetary growth might be expected to Granger

cause output growth in an RBC nodel when the number of aggregate real shocks

impinging on the economy is large relative to the number of real variables in

        Here we have found little evidence that &r1Mt÷1 Granger causes Eny in

several imiltivariate VARs including bivariate representations. At the same

time, stock returns evidently do Granger cause 2Yt' which suggests that

there were at least two significant aggregate real shocks impinging on the

post war economy.    Money is evidently rt proxying for unobserved taste or

technology shocks in these VARs even though the rximber of real shocks exceeds

the dimension of S .     These findings raise interesting cpestions about the

links between money and output in the U.S. economy that warrant further

investigation, and that are not easily addressed within the context of many

recent monetary models or the model in Section 3.

    Proceeding under the null hypothesis that a real business rcle view is

correct, the variance decompositions of output re also calculated.      Sims'

method for orthogonalizing the error terms from the VAR was used, with real

variables appearing before the nominal variables in the vector St. Under this

ordering, the innovations in the real variables are interpreted as linear

combinations of the innovations to agents' preference and technology shocks.




                                      51
In all of the decompositions we chose an ordering of variables in which output

appeared first. It su1d be equally consistent with the RBC model of Section

4.A to choose an ordering in which either of the two asset returns appeared

prior to output.     In practice, we icountered very little sensitivity to

permutations of the orderings within the real block S. In part this
reflects the fact that monthly data was used. For monthly data, the

contemporaneous correlations among the innovations in the VAR are small.

    All reported variance decompositions are based on 48 month ahead forecast

errors. Table 5.1 reports the decomposition of the variance of .2ny based

upon trivariate VARs including £nyt,        and .2nMt+1.   The reported variance

decompositions of 2ny are sensitive to changes in the sample period.        For

example, in the sample period 1949,2-1979,12, the innovations to lnMt+i and t

account for 34 and 25 percent, respectively, of the error variance of .2ny.

When the sample period is 1952,1-1983,6 these percentages are 9 and 64,

respectively.      Most dramatically, in the sample period 1959,2-1979,12,
innovations in t account for 79 percent of the forecast error variance of

nyt, while nnetary innovations account for only 9 percent of the forecast

error variance in 2nyt.

    The decompositions of the variance of output in Table 5.2, which are based

on trivariate VARs including 2ny', t' and £nM1, are also quite sensitive

to changes in the sample period.    Again innovations in the inflation rate

account for the largest proportion of the variance of output in the post 1959

period. However, comparing Table 5.1 and 5.2 it is seen that innovations in

the inflation rate play a relatively more important role in the variance

decomposition of output based on VARs estimated with rn-detrended data.

Nevertheless, nominal variables accounted for fairly large proportions of the




                                       52
variance of 2ny' in all of the sample periods.

    The decompositions of the variance of output reported in Table 5.3 are

based   on trivariate VARs which included 2nyt,    and tinMt÷1. These results

differ in two important respects from those reported in Tables 5.1 and 5.2.

First, the results display very little sensitivity to changes in the sample

period and the reported standard errors are smaller.    Second, innovations in

t and i2nMt÷1 account for only a small proportion of the error variance of

Yt• Overall the nost unfavorable sample periods from the point of view of

RBC theories are the post 1959 periods.

    Consider next the decompositions of the variance of output based on VARs

which included asset return data.    As before, attention is restricted to the

post 1959 period. Table 5,4 displays the decomposition of the variance of

output based on four-variate VARs including (&2ny, r,            Mt÷1} and
(Yt r,             nMt÷1}. As in Table 53, the reported decompositions are

largely insensitive to changes in the sample period.       In both cases the

output innovations account for a large proportion of the variance of iny.

Innovations in r account for a very small proportion of the variance of

iny, while innovations in r account for approximately 25% of the variance

of wt.
    Table 5.6 reports the variance decomposition of .2ny based on a

five-variate VAR including {..Enyt, r, r,         r1Mt+1). The results are

again insensitive to the choice of the sample period.    Together, innovations

in real variables account for over 90% of the variance of the growth rate in

output.    Innovations in      and nMt÷1 play an insignificant role in the

decomposition. Both Tables 5.4 and Table 5.6 indicate that ex post real stock

returns play a far more important role than ex post real Treasury bill returns




                                       53
in the time series behavior of i2nyt.        This is reflected both in the Granger

causality tests and the decomposition of the variance of Lnyt.

    Finally, Table 5.6 displays the decomposition of the variance of output

based on a five-variate VAR which included {inyt', r, r, t' nMt÷11}.

Innovations in itt' and £nMt+1' account for a significant proportion of the

variance of iny' .   However, the results are sensitive to the choice in the

sample period. For example,     2nMt÷i '     accounts for 46% of the variance of

£nyt' when the sample period is 1959,2-1983,6, but only 12% when the sample

period is    1959,2-1979,12.     A similar         instability of the variance

decompositions is displayed in Table 5.5 for the four-variate VARs including



                                                              t'
(iny, r, inir, 1n14÷1) and (2ny, r, 2nir, 1riM1), and in Table 5.7 for
the five-variate VARs which included (yt', R', ',                  nMt+'). Not
surprisingly standard errors are larger for the decompositions based on

linearly detrended data than those based on the differenced data.




                                        54
6. Concluding Remarks

    A striking finding from our     empirical   analysis is that, for all sample

periods considered and for various nultivariate VARs, lagged values of the

monetary growth rate are not helpful in predicting the current and future

growth rates of   txttput, after conditioning on the other variables in the

VARs.   Interpreted within the context of the monetary model of Section 3,

these results suggest that exogenous shocks to the monetary growth rate were

not an important independent source of variation in output growth during the

post r period in the U.S.        More precisely, statistical representations of

the monetary growth rate suggest that the monetary policy rule involves

feedback on both lagged monetary growth and output. This observation, combined

with the dependence of output on monetary growth through our transactions

technology, suggest that if monetary shocks were an important source of output

variability, then monetary growth would have Granger caused the growth rate of

output in VARs,         Adding sticky wages and prices, overlapping nominal

contracts, or entering money directly in agents' utility functions seems

likely to reinforce the conclusion that monetary growth will Cranger cause

output growth if exogenous stocks to the money supply were an important source

of business cycle fluctuation.

    We hasten to add that the design of our empirical analysis is such that

infrequent monetary shocks that had an important effect on output growth may

not have been detected by our statistical procedures.         All of the sample

periods examined covered several different political administrations and, in

several cases, there re significant changes in the structure of financial

institutions. Additionally, specific events that are widely viewed as being

monetary in nature occured during sample periods that may also have included




                                        55
numerous real shocks.     Put differently, our results do not rule out the

possibility that particular movements in output were largely due to monetary

shocks. Our results only indicate that such shocks were rt sufficiently

frequent and large to be statistically significant over the entire sample

period. More thorough studies of specific events seems worthwhile.

    There are several other considerations that we feel make a real business

cycle interpretation of our findings premature.   First, the empirical results

are not insensitive to the assumptions about the nature of trends.         The

virtual absence of Granger causality from noney to output s obtained when

both of these variables were first differenced. In contrast, when linear

deterministic trends were removed from the logarithms of output and money,

there was much more evidence that money Granger caused output.       Even with

linear trends, however, the evidence was mixed. For the sample period 1959,2

through 1983,6, and in a five-variate VAR including real stock and bond

returns, money innovations accounted for 46% of the variation in detrended

output. (Interestingly, this finding is not consistent with Sims' finding that

monetary shocks explain little of output variation in the presence of interest

rates.) For the sample period 1959,2 through 1979,12, imnetary innovations

accounted for 12% of the variation in detrended output. A comparison of the

results for these two sample periods suggests that monetary thocks may have

been important for 1tput fluctuation during the early 1980's. But the

standard errors for the estimated variance decompositions are quite large and

detrended money did not Granger cause detrended output for the longer sample

period. Also, recall that money accounted for an insignificant percentage of

the variation in output over both sample periods when these series were time-

differenced.




                                     56
    We wish to re-emphasize the potential importance of investigating the role

of technological factors in generating business cycles within       nodels that

explicitly incorporate monetary exchange. Market structures in monetary

economies are very different from the market structures that have been assumed

in the literature on real business cycle models.     Our example economies show

that one could be seriously mislead in characterizing the structure of a

monetary economy, despite obtaining a good statistical fit using a real

business cycle model.

    Finally, it is perhaps possible to reconcile our empirical findings with

modern Keynesian or rxrn-Keynesian monetary business cycle theories.   However,

to accomplish this reconciliation, these models must be formulated so as to be

consistent with both the findings that output growth does rot Cranger cause

money   growth and   that noney growth depends on lagged output growth and noney

growth.    We conjecture that in constructing such models researchers will be
lead   to re-examine the relative importance of various channels through which
monetary   factors affect real economic activity. In particular, the importance

of financial institutions in the propogation of real shocks may be more

pronounced in nonetary nodels in which the structure of financial contracts

emerges from a more thorough treatment of frictions.

    'After we completed this paper, Bennett McGallum pointed out to us that an

important implication of early Keynesian business cycle models with sticky

prices and a horizontal U function is that noney should rot Granger cause

iiominal income.     This implication is,        of course, counterfactual.   The

equilibrium real business cycle models that we examine do not have this

implication.

    2See McCallum (1985) for a related criticism of the Kydland-Prescott

analysis.

    31n solving for xt we have followed the common practice of not imposing

non-negativity constraints on the capital stock kt.          whether or not this

constraint is binding in practice will depend i the distribution of the

shocks and the particular realizations in the current period.         One way of

obtaining a solution for which the constraint never binds is to assume that in

equilibrium xt is proportional, to kt with the proportionality factor being in

the interval (0,1). This is the approach taken by Garber and King (1983) for

their real economy. It turns out that the two approaches yield the same law

of motion for xt for the real economy in the absence of taste shocks, but they

differ when taste shocks are present.        In practice, neither solution may be

strictly correct for    the chosen distributions of the shocks under a

non-negativity constraint, Fortunately, our key points about the properties

of real versus nonetary business cycle nodels emphasized subsequently are not

sensitive to which solution is studied.

    4This relation is derived by introducing one-period bond holdings into the

consumer's budget constraint and deducing the first order conditions for this




                                        58
modified optimum problem without assuming that the cash-in-advance constraint

is always binding.

    5Throughout this paper the assumption that mEt is lognormally distributed

is made only for convenience; tone of our qualitative conclusions depend on

this assumption.     The expression for r÷1 implied by our model when the

distribution of 6    is   left unspecified is identical to the expression in the

text, except that exp(½o} is replaced by Et(et+1).

    5Standard errors of all variance decompositions reported in this paper

were computed using the Monte Carlo procedure described in the RATS manual,

page 17-3. Let b denote the estimated VAR coefficient vector and let V

denote the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals in the VAR.      Suppose

that the VAR disturbances are i.i.d. and tormally distributed.         Then the

posterior distribution of (b,V) is Normal-Wishart (see Zeliner (1971)).      Two

hundred draws were taken from this distribution and the variance decomposition

of the 48-month ahead forecast error implied by each draw was calculated. The

reported standard error is the square root of the sample variance of the

estimated variance decompositions from the two hundred simulations.
