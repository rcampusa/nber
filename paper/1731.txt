                    The   Determinants of IRA Contributions
                       and   the Effect of Liit Changes


                                    ABSTRACT



           Tax-deferred savings are potentially an important component of
  savings for retirement and could
                                   represent a very substantial increase in
  tax-free savings for
                          many employees. 1RAS may also have a substantial
 effect Ofl national
                       savings. Total IRA contributions
                                                            in 1982 were over 29
 billion dollars. Despite the program's size and potential
                                                                  significance,
 little is known about the
                              determinants of IRA contributions.
                                                                     This paper
 presents: (1) analysis of the effect of individual attributes
                                                               on whether a
 person contributes, (2) analysis of the effect of individual
                                                              attributes on
 how much is contributed,
                          and (3) simulations of the effect of potential
 changes in contribution limits
                                 on the amount that is contributed to IRA
 accounts. Results of a similar
                                  analysis based on Canadian data
                                                                   are compared
 with results for the United
                             States. Persons with low incomes are unlikely
 to have IRA accounts. In
                           addition, after controlling for income, age, and
other variables, persons without private pension
                                                   plans are no more likely
than those with them to Contribute to an IRA. The
                                                     analysis of Canadian data
yields similar findings, and indeed specific parameter
                                                         estimates for the two
countries are very similar.
                              Simulations based on the estimates
                                                                  suggest that
the current Treasury
                     Department proposal would lead to about a 30 percent
increase in IRA contributions

          To encourage employees not covered
                                                 by private pension plans to save
 for retirement, individual retirement
                                         accounts (IRA) were established in
 1974 as part of the Employee Retirement
                                              Income Security Act. Emphasizing
 the need to enhance economic
                                well-being of future retirees and the need to
 increase national savings, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 extended

 the availability of IRA's to all employees and raised the contribution

 limit. Now any employee with earnings in excess of $2,000 can contribute
                                                                                 up
 to $2,000 to an IRA account each year, with tax on the principle and

interest deferred until money is withdrawn from the account. The
                                                                 conthined
contribution of an employee and a
                                     non-working spouse can be as high as
$2250. A married couple who are both working can contribute $2000 each.

Current tax proposals contemplate
                                    raising the individual IRA limit to $2500
and the (non-working) spousal IRA limit from $250 to $2500.

         Tax-deferred savings are potentially an important component of

savings for retirement and could
                                   represent a very substantial increase in
tax-free savings for many employees.    Indeed, a $2000 contribution to a
retirement account represents a future pension benefit greater than
                                                                    many
employer-provided private pension plans. The availability of IRAs may also

have a substantial effect on national
                                        savings. According to IRS data, total
IRA contributions in 1982 were over 29 billion dollars.

        Despite the program's size and potential significance1 suprisingly

little is known about the determinants of IRA contributions. Thus the goals

of this analysis are: (1) to analyze the effect of individual attributes on

whether a person contributeS, (2) to determine the effect of individual

attributes on how much is contributed, and (3) to simulate the effect of

potential changes in contribution limits on the amount that is contributed

to IRA accounts. The results can be used to judge whether the goals that

justified introduction of the program are being realized. In particular,
                                                                   them.

         The analysis is based on data obtained through a special supplement

 based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances and a special Carnegie

 Commission Survey of college and university employees.

          Descriptive statistics on contributions to IRA accounts are
                                        statistical model that is used in the
 presented in the next section. The

 analysis is described in section II.     The results are presented in

                                              similar analysis based on Canadian
 section III. In section IV, results of a

 data are compared with results for the United States. The Registered

 Retirement Savings Plan in Canada is a tax-deferred program that

 incorporates the characteristics of both IRA and Keogh-like plans in the

 United States, although the contribution
                                             limits are quite different in the
 two countries. The same statistical model
                                               has been estimated on data from
 both countries.

          The major empirical findings may be summaried briefly: tax-deferred

 savings plans are unlikely to be used
                                         by low-income persons. Thus they do
 not in general Substitute for private pension plans, since higher-income

 persons are more likely than those with lower incomes to be covered by

 private plans. Given income and other individual
                                                      characteristics, persons
with private pension plans are no less likely than those without such
                                                                      plans
to contribute to an IRA. The findings
                                         for Canada are very similar to those
for the United States. Since the limits
                                             are very different, the similar
findings provide support for the statistical specification.

         Simulations based on the parameter estimates for the United States

indicate that if the limits were increased in accordance with the
                                                                  recently
proposed Treasury Department changes to the tax system, contributions would

increase by about 30 percent.



I. Descriptive Statistics

         Since model parameter estimates for the United States will

ultimately be compared with those for Canada, the descriptive statistics in

this section are presented for both countries. For several reasons, the

data for the two countries are not
                                     strictly comparable, although they allow
rough comparisons between the two countries.

         Most contributions are made by middle income employees.   Although

32 percent of employed persons in the United States have incomes below

$10,000, this group is responsible for only about 10 percent of total IRA

contributions. Approximately 80 percent of contributions are made by

persons with incomes between $10,000 and $50,000. Persons with incomes

greater than $50,000 contribute only about 10 percent of total

contributions. In Canada, about 82 percent of contributions are made by

individuals with incomes between $10,000 and $50,000 and about 15 percent by

persons with incomes above $50,000. only 3 percent of contributions are

made by those with incomes below $10,000, as compared with 10 percent in the

United States. (See table 1.)

         As shown in table 2, only 5 percent of persons with incomes less

than $10,000 made an IRA contribution in 1982 in the United States, and only

about 2 percent in Canada. The proportions of higher income groups making

contributions are similar in the United States and Canada, although

in general the proportions are lower in the United States than in Canada.

Whereas the IRA program is new for most people in the United States, the

Canadian RRSP plan was started in 1957.

          Only 11 percent of all contributors in the United States have

 incomes less than $10,000, 80 percent have incomes between $10,000 and

 $50,000, and about 9 percent have incomes greater than $50,000. Again, the

 percentages in Canada are very similar to those in the United States. Seven

 percent of contributors have incomes less than $10,000, about 88 percent

 have incomes between $10,000 and $50,000, and 7 percent have incomes greater

Tabulations for the U.S. are in U.S. dollars and those for Canada in

Canadian dollars. Data for the U.S. are from the May 1983 CPS and supple-

mental Survey of Pension and Retirement Plan Coverage. The data are

weighted to represent the employed population, ages 18 to 65, excluding the

self-employed. The Canadian data are based on a random sample of tax filers

and are weighted to represent all tax filers.

   a. The Canadian data pertain to 1980 and the U.S. data to 1982.

Tabulations for the U.S. are in U.S. dollars and those for Canada in

Canadian dollars. Data for the U.S. are from the May 1983 CPS and supple-

mental Survey of Pension and Retirement Plan Coverage.    The data are

weighted to represent the employed population, ages 18 to 65, excluding the

self-employed. The Canadian data are based on a random sample of tax filers

and are weighted to represent all tax filers.

  than $50,000.

           Proportions that contribute to the contribution limits in the two

 countries are shown in table 3. Because
                                               the contribution limits vary
 substantially between the two countries, the numbers must be viewed

 accordingly.l In neither country does the
                                                 proportion contributing to the
 limit in any income group exceed 60 percent. In
                                                 addition, women are
 apparently more likely than men to contribute to the limit in the United

 States, whereas in Canada the difference
                                               seems less apparent, although at
 least for persons with incomes below
                                         $50,000 the proportion for women is
 greater than for men, with the exception of the zero to $10,000 income
                                                                              group.
          Average contributions in the United States range from $75 for the

 lowest income group to $1116 for those with incomes greater than
                                                                  $70,000;
while the average contribution of
                                    contributors ranges from $1517 to $1883.
 (See table 4.) This suggests that
                                      among those who contribute, a large
proportion in each income group contributes at the limit. Unreported

tabulations indicate that at very high income levels 85 to 90 percent of

all contributions are at the limit.     The percent of employees with
Contributions at the limit
                             ranges from about 3 percent for low-income to 50
percent for high income empoyees. The figures for Canada are comparable,

but the average contribution levels
                                      are considerably higher, reflecting the
higher limits. In addition, the Canadian data pertain to both employees and

self-employed persons, while the US data
                                              pertain only to employees and thus
exclude contributions to Keogh plans.

tend to make somewhat larger contributions than those who are not, and they

are also somewhat more likely to make contributions at the limit, as shown

in table 5.   In Canada, the limit on RRSP contributions increases with

income and the maximum is higher for persons without than for those with a

private plan. Thus for higher income persons, contributions are higher for

those without private plans. Nonetheless, for most income intervals those

with a private pension plan are more likely than those without one to

contribute at the limit.

         In summary: the descriptive data indicate that IRAs are typically

not used by low income employees, and that they do not in general serve as a

substitute for private pension plans.



II. The Statistical Model

         The results suggest that relatively unambiguous answers can be

provided to the three questions addressed in this paper.   On the other hand,

an analysis of the effect of tax-deferred accounts on net savings requires

related but new and somewhat more complicated statistical procedures, and it

seems apparent that the question will be answered only with more ambiguity

 and less confidence than the first three. Thus it is important to set forth

 the analysis so that questions that can be answered relatively precisely can

 be distinguished from those that inherently leave more room for doubt. To

 put in perspective the analysis conducted in this paper, it may be useful to

 illustrate how it is related to a more general analysis designed to estimate

 the net effect of taxâ€”deferred accounts on individual saving.   With this

           The procedure outlined here addresses
                                                   these problems by considering
 an individual's preferred allocation of current income to current

 consumption, tax-deferred savings, and other forms of saving, and then how

 observed choices are affected by the limit on the tax-deferred savings

 alternative. Based on such a model, it would be possible to simulate, for

 example, how total savings would be changed if the limit on tax-deferred

 savings were raised or lowered. The procedure relies
                                                          heavily on the fact
 that the optimal savings behavior of individuals who are not constrained
                                                                          by
 the limit differs from from the behavior of those who are, with statistical

 correction for the fact that persons who are at the limit, everything else

 equal, are likely to have a greater preference
                                                   for saving than those who are
 not constrained; they are likely to save more in any form. In practice, the

 idea is to estimate the
                           parameters of a "preference" function whose
                                                                         primary
arguments are IRA contributions, at least one other form of savings, and

current consumption. Associated with the preference function are optimal

IRA contributions and optimal savings in other forms. In practice, it is

necessary to choose these "demand" functions to fit the
                                                           observable data, and
then to choose the preference function
                                         consistent with them. The procedure
can be illustrated based on a simple preference function.

         To illustrate the idea, suppose that preferences for consumption

and savings out of current income may be described by the simple form


           â€”    -      -    112 1 2
where V is income,
                     S1 and S2 are tax deferred savings and other savings

respectively, and I3 and 2 are parameters to be estimated.     This function
                                            -9-




is intended to represent preferences over possible allocations of current

income conditional on individual attributes like income and age, and

individual perceptions of the riskiness of different forms of savings.2

This approach allows inferences about the relationship of income allocation

to age, without constraining the functional form to correspond to a

particular life-cycle hypothesis. In practice, the parameters would depend

upon measured individual attributes and would be allowed to vary randomly

among individuals to capture unmeasured variation in individual preferences

for current versus future consumption as well as different perceptions of

risk, etc. In this simple case, the unconstrained optimal saving choices

are

                        and
         S1 =    1Y,
(2)
            =


But in fact, the optimal choice is subject to a constraint; S1
contributions cannot be greater than the IRA limit L. Until this limit is

reached, contributions obey the equations above. But more generally the

S1 and 2 functions are of the form



                 r
                                       if1Y<L
         S1 =
                 LL                    if    ?    L

                 I   2''               if    <    L


          S2 =

  Thus there are two
                     S2 saving functions. As long as the IRA limit has not
  been reached, savings obey the optimizing rule
                                                                Y. But after the limit is
  reached, the savings function is of the form
                                                               [2/(1-1)](y-L)   This
  illustration ignores the tax deferment that makes IRA's
                                                          more attractive than
  alternative forms of retirement
                                  savings. Introducing the tax rate in the
  example changes the utility function to


  (4)       V = [Y(1â€”t) â€”
                             S1   (iâ€”t) â€”   S]
                                            L

 where, assuming that savings are small relative to income, t is
                                                                 the marginal
 tax rate. The optimal saving choices then become


                  I                                      < L

           Si =

                  LL

                                            if       < L
           S2 =
                  I

                       ti

In   this formulation, the marginal tax rate does not affect
                                                                         S (IRA) saving,

â€¢the parameters       and  The empirical findings reported below suggest an
uncertain effect of the marginal
                                 tax rate independent of income, even though
the rate of return on the IRA
                              does depend on the marginal tax rate.

          In practice, the parameters

individual characteristics like age, occupation, possibly income itself, the

tax rate, and other conditioning variables that would be likely to determine

individual preferences over possible allocations of current income. To

estimate the model, it is also necessary to choose a stochastic

specification for the s. One also needs to choose a specification that

allows optimal, or "desired", values S1 and S2 to be negative, since many

individuals will not save in any form and indeed will borrow.3

         As emphasized above, this particular functional form is only for

illustrative purposes; the form that is ultimately chosen must be determined

by the data. But the simple example demonstrates how changes in the limit

may affect behavior. In particular. explicit reference to a preference

function assures a specification of savings S2 after the limit L on S1 is

reached that is internally consistent with the function that applies before

the limit is reached. And, in a fully specified model, estimates of the s

could be used to simulate the effects of changes in the limit L on total

savings, not just the effect on taxâ€”deferred savings.   Estimation of the


S1 function is treated in this paper.4



     B. Independent Analysis of Contributions to Tax Deferred Savings
         Accounts

          Within the general framework described above, one can treat

 separately the tax deferred saving equation.   Careful treatment of that

 component of the more general specification is the subject of this section.

 There are at least two important issues to address in analyzing the

 determinants of IRA contributions. One is simply that in addition to the
                                        â€”12â€”



  upper limit on contributions many individuals,
                                                     indeed the majority, do not
  contribute at all to IRA (or Keogh)
                                        accounts. The standard way to conduct
  the analysis in this situation would be to use a Tobit model with
                                                                    a lower
  truncation point at zero and an
                                    upper truncation point at the contribution
  limit. The second issue, however, is
                                          that the determinants of whether one
 contributes at all may be different from
                                               the determinants of how much one
 contributes once an account is established.
                                                  While it is true that the
 short run effect of changes in
                                  contribution limits on total contributions is
 determined only by initial contributors, there may be considerably
                                                                    more room
 to change total contributions
                               through increasing the number of persons who
 contribute than by increasing the Contributions of current contributors.
                                                                                   It
 is important, therefore, to understand the determinants of the
                                                                contributor
 status decision.


          1. Key Issues

          To provide accurate predictions of
                                                 the determinants of IRA

Contribution limits, the most important
                                           consideration in estimation is to
account for the existing limit on observed contributions
                                                               Thus, an
intuitive discussion of the effect of the limit on estimation,
                                                               together with
procedures that can be used to correct for
                                               -it, helps to put the important
ideas in perspective, although
                                 part of the discussion will be familiar to
many readers. Mathematical details of the
                                               estimation procedure are
presented in appendix A.

        Consider first the diagram in
                                         figure 1. Suppose that the
                                    â€”13--




relationship between income and IRA contributions if there were no

contribution limits would be represented by the line a +     by.   That is,

                                 contribution would be a + bY.     Of course,
given Y the average (expected)

for any level of income V there would be a distribution of contribution

                                             lines; not everyone with income
levels, represented by the wavy vertical

level V would contribute the same amount. Now suppose that everyone in the

sample faced a contribution limit L.    We would now observe no contributions

                                            otherwise would contribute above
above L and presumably individuals who

this limit would in the face of the limit contribute at the limit. This

would give rise to a concentration of contributions at the limit, indicated

by the heavy dots at that level.    In addition, it is not possible to

contribute less than zero; we would observe a concentration of points at
                                             the horizontal axis. If we think
 zero, indicated by the heavy dots along

 of fitting a line, say by least squares, to the data points that are

 actually observed, we would obtain a fitted line something like the dashed

 line in the diagram.

          Suppose that from this fitted line we attempted to predict the

 relationship between income and contributions S. It is easy to see that
                                                                   Thus it is
 this estimate would be a very substantial underpredictiOn.

 clear that standard estimation procedures will not lead to plausible

 conclusions in this case. And it should also be clear from the diagram

 that the reason is that observed observations do not represent the

 contributions that individuals would like to make were they not constrained

 by the limit.

        It is useful also to consider the distribution of contributions

for persons with a particular level of income, say *â€¢    An illustrative

distribution is shown in figure 2.    If it were not for the limit at L and

the limit at zero, the distribution of contributions S would look something

like the bell-shaped curve, but as demonstrated in the figure above, we

know that we will not observe observations greater than L, and we will

observe no observations less than zero. The distribution of observed

observations between zero and L would look just like the underlying curve.

But instead of a distribution tapering off smoothly to the right and to the

left, there would be concentrations of observations at L and at zero.

         The standard Tobit maximum likelihood estimation procedure that

takes account of this truncation effect is based on an assumed underlying

relationship like a + bY, as shown in figure 1, together with a

distribution of contributions around this relationship. In this case there

are three possible outcomes: the contribution is zero, it is between zero

and L, or it is at L. The values of a, b, and c that maximize the

likelihood of observing the sample values yield estimates of the

relationship labeled a + bY in figure 1, as well as the dispersion of

underlying observation around this expected value. Thus the estimates that

are obtained need to be interpreted as pertaining to this underlying

 relationship. For example, b indicates the relationship between V and S if

 there were no limit on contributions. Or, it tells us how an increase in

 income would affect contributions as long as the contribution limit were

 not reached; after that, contributions would be observed at the limit L but
                                                   â€”15â€”



 desired contributions would be above L.

           It is also important to realize that only persons who are

 constrained by the current limit will be affected by a new higher limit.

 (If the limit is lowered, of course,
                                                        increasingly large numbers of people
 will be constrained by it.) With the help of figure 2, it is
                                                              easy to
 determine the effect of small changes in L on contributions. Consider first

 an individual whose observed contribution is less than L. Such an

 individual could contribute more but chooses not to; he is not constrained

 by the limit. His desired contribution level is less than L. So raising

 the limit would not increase his contribution
                                                                   level. Consider on the other
 hand a person who is observed to contribute at the limit L.                       If L were
raised, this person would likely contribute more. Thus the effect of

raising the limit by 1 is just 1 times the probability that the individual

is constrained by the limit. Somewhat more formally, we can write the

derivative as



                    dC   =
                             IOifC<L
                    dL
                                     1 if C > L
(5)
                         =   0   â€¢
                                     Pr[C      <   L]   + 1   â€¢
                                                                  Pr[C   >   L]
                         =   Pr[C     >   L)

Thus for any individual the expected change in the contribution level is

equal to the probability that his underlying desired contribution is greater

than L.

          It is also important to realize that this
                                                                         derivative depends upon
the level of L. Suppose that L were farther to the right than is shown in
                                  â€”16â€”




figure 2, say at L'. The effect on contributions of an increase in the

limit from L' would be much smaller than the effect of an increase from L

because the likelihood that an individual with income Y* would like to

contribute more than L' is much lower than the likelihood that he would like

to contribute more than L. While all people, or almost all people with

observed contributions at L would increase their contributions if the limit

were raised, very few would increase their contributions to the level L'.

Thus to infer the effect of an increase in the limit on contributions, it is

recessary to have an estimate of the underlying distribution of desired

contribution levels. With an estimate of the distribution of S given Y, it

is possible to predict the expected contribution given Y* for any level of

L.



         2. Estimation Possibilities

         In practice, estimates that address the issues motivated above can

be developed in several ways, depending on the hypothesized underlying

process that leads to observed contributions.   There are two basic

possibilities. One possibility assumes, as in the discussion above, that

 zero contributions can be thought of simply as a special case of a single

 underlying preferred contribution behavioral relationship.   That is, one

 could think of a preferred contribution level that declines continuously

 with decreases in income until the zero contribution level is reached. The

 other general possibility is that there are two underlying behavioral

 relationships that determine observed contributions: one relationship

 describes the likelihood that a person will be a contributor and the second
                                    â€”17â€”



 relationship describes the desired contribution, should he be a contributor.

          If only one behavioral relationship is assumed, there are at least

 three ways to obtain estimates. The alternative procedures allow a test of

 the underlying assumption itself. One procedure uses all observations

 including those with zero contributions; the second
                                                       uses only observations
 with positive contributions; and the third uses only the information on

 whether a person contributes without using the amount of a positive

contribution.5 If there is, in fact,
                                       only one underlying relationship that

determines observed contributions, then each of these methods yields

consistent estimates of the parameters of this
                                                 single relationship (except
for the third which yields estimates up to a variance scaling factor). If

the estimates based on the different groups of observations lead to

different estimates, then it is likely that the underlying process should be

described by two relationships.

         If the goal of the analysis were only to predict the effect of

changes in the limits, it is reasonable to concentrate on those who

contribute and to allow the parameter estimates to be determined by this

group, since noncontributors are not initially affected by changes in the

limit. It is at least as important, however, to understand the factors

that determine whether a person is a contributor.   As emphasized above,
changes in the number of contributors at any limit could have a much greater

effect on savings than changes in the limit. To the extent that the

determinants of whether one is a contributor are different from the             -




determinants of the amount of the contribution, it is important to consider
                                             -18-




both of these relationships. The formal details of a two equation model,

together with details of the single equation estimation possibilities and

related tests of behavioral assumptions are presented in appendix A.


        C. The Empirical Specification

            In the illustrative specification in section A above, desired

contributions to the tax-deferred savings account are of the form S =            Y.     A

direct statistical counterpart of this specification is:



(6)         S =   Yee   =   ayb.y,eC =   a0X1a1x2a2YV.ec

Based on estimates for Canada, this specification fits the observations on

positive contributions extremely well.              Note that the specification implies

that given Y (and the other variables X) the variance of S increases with Y;

the disturbance term is heteroscedastic. The specification also leads to a

constant income elasticity and is conveniently linear in logs. However this
                                                               contributions at zero
 specification is not appropriate if we incorporate
                                                     desired contributions less than
 and, in the abstract, the possibility of

 zero. To consider whether the determinants of contributor status are

 different from the determinants of the amount of positive contributions, a

 specification that in principle allows negative as well as positive values
                                                                contributions must be
 and one that also fits the observations on positive

 used. Such a specification, and one that in practice fits the observed data

 well, is of the form


             S = a +          +   )Y   + c
  (7)                                  1+b
                  =a0+a1X1+a2X2+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ +Y    +rV+E
                                                   -19-



 where i and Â£        are disturbance terms and the variance of         rY +   Â£ is   given by

 (8)            V(riY +     =        +    =   a2


 Thus the specification incorporates the property that the variance of S

 increases with income, and it also allows for "desired contributions less

 than zero. The elasticity of desired contributions with respect to income

 is given by (1 +         b)Ã·(1 +   aIv)      and thus approaches 1+b as income
 increases.6

               For simplification, appendix A, that describes the details of the

alterantive estimation procedures, is written in terms of the specification
S =    X   +   , where    V(c)      a2. Development in terms of the above specification

may be obtained by replacing X by a +                 1+b   and a2 by (aY2 +
                                                                               a).     Recall
that the three single-equation approaches use: (a) all observations

including those with zero Contributions (twoâ€”limit
                                                                  Tobit); (b) only
observations with positive contributions (one-limit Tobit); and (c) only

information on contributor status (probit). A two-equation model that

jointly estimates contributor and contribution outcomes is also described in

appendix A. This model permits the determinants of whether a person

contributes to differ from the determinants of the desired level of a

positive contribution and allows the stochastic components of the two

choices to be correlated.

               In addition, the CPS data on IRA contributions
                                                                      are reported only by
interval --       0, 0 to 100, 100 to 500, 500 to 1000, 1000 to 2000, etc. Thus

the probabilities of positive contributions are of the form
                                            â€”20â€”




(9)       â€¢[(u â€”   X)/a]   â€”
                               4[(1   â€”   X)/a]

where u and 1 are the upper and lower bounds of an interval and (.) denotes

the standard normal distribution function. Thus the likelihood function in

this case includes no density function terms; it is composed only of normal

cumulative distribution functions. This may be contrasted with the Canadian

data that record exact prositive contributions.



III. Results

      A. Data

          The data were obtained through a special supplement to the May

1983 Current Population Survey. The data on IRA contributions pertain to

the 1982 tax year. No information -is provided on 1982 contributions to

Keogh plans. Thus self-employed persons have been excluded from this

analysis. In addition, the raw data pertain to individuals, not families.

Some of the estimates reported below are based on the individual data, with

indicator variables for marital status and sex. Since it is not known from

the person data whether an individual's spouse works, the actual upper

limit on family contributions cannot be determined from the individual data

alone. Some individuals reported contributions greater than $2,000 --

primarily   at $2250 and at $4000, apparently confusing individual

contributions with the family total. When the individual data are used,

contributions above $2000 are not explicitly recorded at that level, but

rather any reported contribution above $2000 is treated as a contribution at

the $2000 limit. Under the model assumption, this procedure still yields
                                      -21â€”



 unbiased parameter estimates; it simply does not use all information.

          Family data were created by matching and
                                                      combining information
 for individuals in the same household.
                                             This allows estimation of family
 income and of family IRA contribution limits based on the employment status

 of the husband and wife. Estimated
                                        marginal tax rates were also calculated

 for the family. The estimates were based on average marginal tax rates by

 income and family status reported by the IRS. As mentioned above, IRA

 contributions for each family member are reported only by interval. The

 intervals for a family were obtained
                                        by inferring the possible family
 intervals from the possible individual
                                          reporting intervals. There are 12
possible family intervals in total. Details of the procedures used to

create the family data and the tax rates are reported in appendix B.


    B. Parameter Estimates: Single Equation Models

        1. Person Data

         Estimates by method of estimation are reported in tables 6 and 7.

Summary statistics for the variables included in each equation are presented

in appendix table 1. Table 7 includes variables indicating whether a
                                                                     person
was covered by a private pension plan and whether the worker participated in

a salary reduction plan (401(K) or 403(B) plans which permit workers to

defer compensation); these variables are not included in table 6.

The first column in each table presents estimates based on the two-limit

Tobit specification. The second column shows probit estimates where the

standard error of c is set at the twoâ€”limit
                                               Tobit estimate (e.g., 5622 in
table 6). This allows easy comparison of the two sets of estimates. it

                                  â€”22â€”



may be seen that the parameter estimates are virtually the same. Whether

there is a difference between the determinants of contribution status and

the determinants of the desired level of IRA contribution may not be

revealed by this comparison, however, since the preponderance of individuals

make no contribution and thus the contribution status (the probit portion)

will dominate the two-limit estimates. The two-limit Tobit estimates will

therefore tend to look like the probit estimates.

         A better way to reveal differences in the two relationships is to

separate analysis of contribution amounts from the analysis of contributor

status. The 1-limit Tobit estimates in column three of the tables are based

only on the contributions of contributors, and the probit estimates of

contributor status in column 4 are obtained by setting the standard error of

e equal to the one-limit estimate (e.g., 2026 in table 6). These last two

columns reveal that the two sets of coefficients are quite similar. The

reported coefficient on income is the estimate of (1 +   b).   It is virtually

the same in each of the alternative methods, and the estimated parameters on

age seem not to be significantly different in the two cases.    The estimated

sex effects are also very close in the two cases, with one exception.    The

estimates suggest that unmarried men contribute more than married men but

are apparently rio more likely than married men to contribute. The constant

terms in the two equations differ, although given the estimated standard

errors, the difference may not be as great as the estimated values suggest.

         A more formal test is to compare the sum of the likelihood values

from columns 3 and 4 with the likelihood value in column 1. Under the null
                                    â€”23-



 hypothesis that one behavioral relationship is sufficient to describe both

 contributor status and the amount of contributions, the sum of the

 likelihoods in columns 3 and 4 will not be statistically different from the

 likelihood value in column 1. Minus 2 times the difference will be

 distributed chiâ€”square with 7 degrees of freedom, with a .05 level of 14.1.

 Thus, the hypothesis would be rejected in this case. However, the very

 large sample size will reveal differences even if they have rather small

 practical importance.

          The coefficient on income of .753 implies an elasticitiy of desired

contribution with respect to income of .63, evaluated at the mean of the

data for contributors. The desired contribution
                                                   increases by about $110
with each year of age according to the estimates for contributors, while the

comparable estimate from the probit equation is $81. Given other variables,

married women would choose to contribute about $1000 more than married men

and the more educated would contribute more than those with less education.

The estimated unmarried women effect is
                                          not statistically significant.

         Summary statistics presented earlier in table 5 suggested that

employees covered by a private pension plan were more likely to contribute

to an IRA. Parameter estimates in table 7, however, suggest that the

association between pension coverage and IRA contributions can be attributed

to other differences in the individual characteristics of those covered and

not covered by a pension plan. After controlling for other characteristics,

pension plan coverage is not significantly associated with desired

contributions. Participation in a salary reduction plan (less than
                                   â€”24â€”




4 percent of the sample) is positively associated with IRA contributions.

        Both the two-limit and the one-limit models fit the data rather

well. This is demonstrated in table 8. Based on the estimates in table

                                             with contributions at zero, at
6, the predicted proportion of individuals

the upper limit, and within selected intervals are compared with the

actual proportions, by income interval. It is important in interpreting

these results to realize that gross misspecificatiofl of the functional

form that relates contributions to income would be revealed in the

comparisons by income level. The comparisons indicate close

correspondence between predicted and actual proportions.    The only

apparent discrepency is that the two-limit Tobit specification

underpredicts the proportion of contributions in the $1000 to $2000 range
                                                     contributions at the
and correspondingly overpredicts the proportion of

limit. Given the differences between a few of the two-limt and one-limit

parameter estimates, the similarity of the predictions may be surprising.

However, the major difference in parameter estimates is a larger negative

constant term in the two-limit than in the one-limit specification, that

 is offset by a larger disturbance term variance.   The likelihood function

 is quite flat with respect to these two parameters.    Thus the sum of the

 last two likelihoods is not in magnitude so different from the two-limit

 Tobit likelihood.


          2. Family Data

  with two exceptions: the
                             marginal tax rate has been added and the
                                                                   dummy
 variable for "married-women" has been deleted, with non-single-person

  families the norm group. Married
                                      men and women appear together in the
 family data, but as two separate
                                    observations in the person data.

          Where the variables are the
                                         same, the parameter estimates are very
 similar to those based on the
                                 person data. For example, the estimated
 income coefficient based on the two-limit tobit model is 0.78
                                                               using family
 data and 0.84 using person data. The effects of age and education
                                                                    are also
 quite close.

          The results suggest no effect of the marginal tax rate on the

 amount of Contributions but a positive
                                          effect on contributor status. The
coefficient on the estimated marginal tax rate in the twoâ€”limit

specification is 200 with a standard error of 39. This would suggest that

an increase of 10 percentage points in
                                          the marginal tax rate would increase
desired IRA contributions by about $2000. On the other hand, the
                                                                 one-limit
and probit estimates in the last
                                   two columns suggest that the tax rate has
no effect on the level of contributions
                                           (column 3) but a positive effect on
contributor status (column 4). The
                                       latter estimate implies that if all
marginal tax rates were increased by 10 percentage points --
                                                             on average from
about 24 to 34 -- the
                      proportion of persons who contribute would increase
from .134 to .193, or by 44 percent.

         Canadian estimates for 1981 (reported below) show a much smaller

statistically significant effect of the marginal tax rate on contributor

status, with a smaller and not
                                 statistically significant effect on the
                                  -26â€”



amount of contributions. (But the difference between the two estimates is

also not significantly different from zero.) Canadian estimates for 1976

show no effect of the marginal tax rate in either equation.7 An alternative

log-linear model for contributors only shows a precisely estimated zero

effect of the marginal tax rate on the amount of contributions in both 1976

and 1980. Thus the estimated effect seems quite sensitive to the

statistical specification.

         Table 10 includes indicators of pension coverage and participation

in a salary reduction plan. These estimates indicate that if at least one

member of a family is covered by a pension plan, the likelihood of

contributing to an IRA is higher. The person data suggested essentially no

relationship. A possible explanation is that married persons without

pensions, but whose spouses are covered by a pension, have a high likelihood

of contributing to an IRA. In the person data, these people would be

treated as not having a private pension.



     C. Simulations: Single Equation Models

         Simulations are obtained under three policy assumptions: the

existing IRA program, the proposal contained in the administration's

recent tax reform proposal (U.S. Department of Treasury [1984]), and a

modification of the Treasury proposal that restricts spousal IRAs. The

Treasury proposal increases the limits to $2500 f or both employed persons

and nonemployed spouses. The modified Treasury proposal also increases

 the limit for employed persons to $2500 but sets the spousal limit at

$500, instead of $2500.

         Simulations based on the family data are presented in table 11.8

To serve as a base for comparison the average IRA contribution under the

current plan has been simulated for several demographic groups.   The model

                                           for all families under the current
yields an average predicted contribution

plan of $312. The simulations indicate that the Treasury plan would

increase 1982 contributionS by 30 percent to $405 per family. The largest

increases are for a married-one-earner families whose limit is increased by

the Treasury proposal from $2250 to $5000. The predicted average

contribution for this group would increase from $267 to $475, about 78

percent. The smallest increase, about 16 percent, is for

married..twoearner1' families whose limit increased only from $4000 to

$5000.

          The modified Treasury plan yields an overall increase of about

 18 percent. The limit changes, and thus contributor responses, for

 unmarried heads and married-two-earner families are the same as in the

 unmodified Treasury proposal. The modified Treasury plan increases the

 limit faced by married-oneâ€”earner families by only $750, from $2250

 to $3000, instead of $5000. The simulated increase in average

 contributions by this group is 25 percent, about a third as large as the

 simulated increase under the Treasury plan.

          Simulations based on the person data are shown in table 12. Unlike

 the family data, the person data do not provide enough information to

 completely specify the limit faced by each person.    Employed single persons

 face a limit of $2000. For married couples the limits are $2000 per person

 if both work and $2250 if only one works. If both work, then both will

 appear in the sample and the appropriate limit for each is $2000.    If

only one is employed, however, the nonemployed spouse will not be present -in

the   sample, since only employed persons received the CPS pension supplement

questionnaire. The appropriate limit for the employed spouse is $2250. The

problem is to assign the "correct" limit ($2000 or $2250) to each married

person in   the sample given that we do not know if the spouse is employed.10

If the married person is a woman, a limit of $2000 is assigned, assuming

that her spouse also works. If the married person is a man, the limit is

randomly assigned. With probability P it is set at $2000 and with

probability 1-P at $2250, where P is the proportion of wives of
                                                                  working
husbands that are employed.

           The person data simulations based on this procedure are quite close

to those obtained using the family data. For all persons, the simulations

indicate the Treasury plan will increase 1982 contributions by about 33

percent and the modified Treasury plan will increase contributions by about

20 percent. The largest effects are for married men, the group facing the

      0. Parameter Estimates: Two Equation Model

          The above results suggest that the observed outcomes can in general

be described well with a single behavioral relationship. If two

relationships are required, the one-limit Tobit and the probit models
                                                  -29-




together, even if estimated independently, should provide a reasonably

accurate description of the determination of contributions.               The

two-equation model described in appendix A, however, distinguishes between a

"potential" contributor behavioral relationship and the level of desired

contributions, were one to contribute. Under this representation, a

potential contributor could be observed with zero contributions not because

the person was a non-contributor, but rather because income say was too low

for the person to devote current income to future consumption.                   To the

extent that the parameters in the two relationships differ, the

singleâ€”equation probit estimates, for example, will not provide accurate

estimates of potential contributor status. As the parameters in the two

relationships become close, and the correlation between them approaches 1,

however, the two-equation model approaches the two-limit Tobit

specification. If only the variable coefficients were the same, the results

could differ if the correlation between the disturbance terms in the two

relationships were not unity.

        Estimation of several two equation models indicated only minor

differences between parameters based on the single equation models and those

derived from two relationships estimated jointly. The two equation model is

of the form

                        b
          S = a +      y    S
                                +         +              Contributor   Status
               5                    S         S



          C = a       + V
                            b   +       V +              Contribution   Amount
                  c                 c         c


 The details of the specification and estimation procedure are described in

 section II of appendix A. The key distinction between the specification
                                               â€¢-30-




 used here and the common sample selection specification is that even

 potential contributors can have zero contributions, while others would not

 contribute under any circumstances. Only the latter are "nonâ€”contributors"
 in the strict sense.

         Illustrative estimates for this model are presented in table 13.

 In this specification, V() =           V(i),      V(c) =    V(c),       and all covariances

 other than Coy (,         are     set to zero.           Education is excluded from the

contributions equation. In practice. covariance or exclusion restrictions

were required for identification of key parameters. Because the likelihood

function was so fiat, more restrictions were necessary than were in

principle required.

        The parameter estimates indicate that the correlation between
                                                                                           c and
   is not significantly different from zero.11 This suggests independence of

the contributor and contributions relationships, given measured individual

characteristics. Thus these estimmates are very close to the single

equation results presented in the last two columns of table 6.12

         In principle, however, this specification allows estimation of the

proportion of persons who are potential contributors but because of. a

liquidity constraint, for example, are observed not to contribute. The

probability that a person does not contribute is given in this

specification by 1 -    Pr[S   <   0]   +   Pr[S   > 0   but C <   0].    Averaged over all

observations in the sample, the proportion of non-contributors is .854, the

same as in the probit estimates based on person data. A proportion .146

contribute. The proportion of potential contributors, Pr[S >                    0],   is

 IV. Comparison of Results for the United States and Canada

          Since the Canadian and the American systems are very similar in

 their general outlines, it is informative to compare the model estimates for

 the two countries. The Canadian equivalent
                                                of IRA and Keogh plans Is the

Registered Retirement Saving Plan (RRSP). RRSP contributions are also

tax-deferred and have upper limits determined both by income and by a

maximum level, The Canadian rules also provide for different limits

depending on whether a person is a member of a private pension plan.

         Since the Canadian tax system is on a person basis, the most

appropriate comparison is with the person estimates for the United States.

Estimates analogous to those in table 1 for the United States are shown in

table 14 for Canada. While the general model specification is identical

in the two countries, the specific variables do not correspond precisely.

In particular, the variables for women, married, and education are not

included in the Canadian version, and there is no marginal tax rate

variable in the United States version. The comparable parameter

estimates, however, are surprisingly similar, based on a comparison of the

one-limit Tobit and the corresponding probit estimates in the two

countries. The coefficient on income is .75 in the United States, while it

is approximately .81 in Canada. The estimated effect of age is

 approximately $80 to $110 in the United States, while it is $65 to $80 in

 Canada. The estimates for Canada also indicate a close correspondence

 between the oneâ€”limit Tobit and the probit estimates, indicating that a

 single behavioral relationship apparently describes the observations rather

well. Indeed for Canada the estimates in the two equations are not

statistically different, based on the chiâ€”squared test described above.

            As discussed above, the estimated effect of the marginal tax rate

 in Canada is not statistically different from zero in the contributions

equation; the estimate for the United States, reported for the family data

in table 9, is also not statistically different from zero. In both

countries the effect of the   tax   rate on contribution status is positive,

although it is much smaller in Canada. As emphasized above, these results

are very sensitive to model specification and it may not be possible to

distinguish the effect of the marginal tax rate from a nonâ€”linear effect of

income.13

         The parameter estimates from a more highly parameterized model for

Canada are shown in table 15. The variable temployee w RPP" indicates

individuals in Canada with a private pension plan. Neither estimate is

statistically different from zero, although the one-limit estimate is

quite negative. In the United States, there appears to be no relationship

between pension coverage and IRA contributions based on the person data,

although there is some evidence of a positive pension relationship in the

family data.

         Because data in Canada are available for several consecutive years,

 it is possible to check the validity of the model specification for that

 country. Between 1976 and 1981, the Canadian Consumer Price Index increased

 by about 60 percent, but RRSP limits did not change over the period. Thus

 in real terms the limits declined very substantially between the years.

 Thus a good external check of the predictive validity of the model is to use

estimates for one of the years to predict contributions in the other, when

 the limit was either considerably higher or much lower.   Such predictions,

using the two-limit and the one-limit estimates reported in table 15, showr-i

 in table 16. In general the predicted values are very close to the actual

ones. For example, one-limit estimates for 1981 underpredict 1976

contributions by only 1.7 percent, and one-limit estimates for 1976

underpredict 198]. contributions by only 1.1 percent. Estimates based on the

two-limit model also yield predicted values very close to actual values.

Since the parameter estimates in the two countries are rather close, this

suggests that the model should predict rather well in the United States as
well.




V. Conclusions

         Persons with low incomes are unlikely to have IRA accounts. In

addition, after controlling for income, age, and other variables, persons

without private pension plans are no more likely than those with them to

contribute to an IRA. Indeed, if anything, those with private plans

to a lesser extent, demographic characteristics. The marginal tax rate may

have a positive effect on whether one contributes, but does not appear to

influence the contribution amount. Results based on different

specifications suggest that it may be difficult to distinguish the effect of

the marginal tax rate from a non-linear income effect. Simulations based on

the estimates suggest that the current Treasury Department proposal would

lead to about a 30 percent increase in IRA contributions.14 Model estimates

based on Canadian data for RRSPs are very similar to those for the United

States. External checks of the predictive validity of the model for Canada

indicate that predictions of the effects of limit changes are quite

accurate.

                  Appendix A: Estimation of IRA Contributions


     To estimate IRA contributions, there are two possibilities: the first is to

assume that one underlying behavioral relationship leads to all of the observed

outcomes. In this case there are three ways to estimate the same parameters and

the difference between the estimates can serve as a basis for a test of the

assumption that one behavioral relationship is sufficient. If it is not, the

second method is to assume that observed behavior results from two behavioral

relationships, one pertaining to the decision to be a contributor and the other

describing the desired amount to contribute, were one a contributor. They are

described in turn. The first is familiar to many readers and the goal is simply

to make clear that, under the maintained hypothesis, the three approaches all

yield estimates of the same parameters. The second approach is not as familiar,

but is a generalization of a similar procedure in Deaton and Irish (1984].


I.    A Single Behavioral Relationship

          S   Latent contribution "propensity,'

Precise amounts contributed by each individual to an IRA are not reported.

Instead, we know if the individual did or did not contribute and, if a

contribution was made, the interval in which the contribution falls.

Details on the intervals are presented in appendix B. The intervals may be

summarized as:15

L3 = $2000.       In the "family" data I = 12.



A. Two-Limit Tobit16

       When all of the observations are used, there are I + 2 possible outcomes --

contributions     at zero, contribution within each of the T closed intervals, and

contributions at the upper limit. These outcomes and associated likelihoods

are:

B. One-Limit Tobit with Zeros Excluded

      When the zero values are excluded, there are T + 1 possible outcomes: the

contribution lies within one of the T intervals or at the upper limit. These

outcomes and associated likelihood are:

The demoninator in each expression, the probability of a positive

contribution, reflects the fact that noncontributors have been excluded from

the analysis. In a single equation model, the underlying distribution of

contributions is truncated at zero when the one-limit Tobit specification is

used, while there is a mass point at zero when the two-limit version is

used.




C. Simple Probit

      Finally, estimates can also be obtained with a simple probit specification

(up to the scale factor a). In this case the outcomes and associated

likelihoods are

this assumption is inconsistent with the data, the                                             estimated from (B)
will differ from the                    estimated from (C). In addition, to the extent

that they differ, the sum of the likelihoods values from (B) and (C) will
                                    â€”39-



be greater than the value from (A) since the "separated" models allow a

better fit to the data. Thus a test of the oneâ€”equation behavioral

assumption can be based either on a comparison of the estimated 's or on the

likelihood values. If they differ, a specification with two behavioral

equations may be indicated.



II.        IRA Contributors and Contributions: A Two-Equation Model

      The purpose of this section is to describe a procedure that can be used to

relax the oneâ€”equation constraint. It is assumed that two behavioral

relationships determine the contributions that we observe. One is a

relationship between individual attributes and the likelihood that a person is a

potential IRA contributor. The other is a relationship between individual

attributes and the level of desired contributions, were one to contribute. Of

course, both of the outcome variables should be thought of initially as latent

variables. In particular, if the latent contribution variable is less than

zero, we shall assume that we observe no contribution, even if the contributor

latent variable is greater than zero. A desirable property of the model is that

it encompasses as a limiting case the standard Tobit model of section I.

      The model is described by:


           C=x+ C
           S=XcL+17

where C -is the latent contribution variable and S the latent contributor

variable, X -is a vector of individual attributes,    and a are vectors of

parameters to be estimated, and c and i    are disturbance terms.17 We assume
                                   -40â€”



that given X, C and S obey the covariance matrix:



       =a      2
                   pa
                    1


where p is the correlation between C and 5, given X.

    The bivariate distribution between S and C is represented graphically in the

figure below. The figure includes the limit on IRA contributions L. That is,

as usual, we will not observe contributions above L but will observe a




                   S

                                                       Contrj but ions




                                                            C

concentration at the level L. We shall assume that a person is a contributor if

the latent contributor variable S is greater than zero, and his desired

contribution amount is greater than zero. Thus when S and C are both greater

than zero we observe IRA contributions greater than zero but less than or equal

to L.

    As in the usual Tobit case, there are three observable outcomes: IRA

contributions are zero, contributions are at some level C where C is greater

than zero but less than L, or we observe C at the limit L. The likelihoods

associated with these three outcomes are now


         Outcome                   Likelihood

         C = 0                     Pr[S <   0]       +   Pr[S      >   0 and C <            0]

         L         < C   < L       Pr[S > 0 and L                      < C   < L       ],   t    =   1, T

description of IRA contributions reduces to the Tobit specification. By

comparing the likelihood values in the two models, one can test explicitly

whether the single behavioral equation version can be rejected. The difference

between this test and those mentioned in section I, -is that the two equations

are allowed to be correlated.

whole. No adjustment to these weights was made for exclusion of

observation due to invalid responses.

         Several problems arose with the way the IRA variables were coded.

Employed persons were asked "Do you have an IRA?".     Those answering in the

affirmative were then asked: "Approximately how much of your own IRA did

you credit to your 1982 Federal taxes?" Responses are coded in the

 intervals:

          under $100
          $100 - $499
          $500 - 999
          $1000 - 1999
          $2000 â€” 2499
          $2500 -

 This categorization led to two problems. First, a surprisingly large
 number of persons reported IRA contributions in the first (under $100)
                                    â€”44-



 category. Most of these responses probably indicate
                                                       persons establishing
 IRAs prior to 1982 and making no contribution in 1982. We have thus

 interpreted the first category to indicate zero contributions in 1982.

         Second, a small number, 186, of respondents indicated a

contribution exceeding $2500. These responses presumably reflect family

rather than own contributions. These observations have been deleted from

our sample.



B. Family Data

         For tax status the family is a more appropriate unit than the

person in the United States. Using relationship codes, ages, and marital

status we have converted the CPS data to a family basis. The incidence of

unclassifiable persons or otherwise inconsistent units was rather high. In

such cases, the observations were deleted from the sample.19   One

consequence is that use of the CPS weights is no longer appropriate.

         There are two important advantages to forming a family based

sample. The first is that the employment status of husband and wife -in

two-person families can be determined. This permits unambiguous assignment
of contribution limits used to simulate policy changes.

         The second advantage is that marginal tax rates can be calculated

based on the family information. Our calculations are based on U.S.

Internal Revenue Service 1984], Statistics of Income for 1982. This

source reports average adjustments and deductions by income category. The

first step is to convert each family's reported total income to adjusted
                                  â€”45--




gross income by accounting for average adjustments (excluding IRAs and

Keoghs) by income class. To obtain taxable income, personal exemptions

($1000 for self, spouse if married, and each child) and the average

itemized home mortgage interest deduction (in excess of the standard

deduction if one were not to itemize) for families reporting owning a home

are subtracted from gross income. Finally, 1982 tax tables by filing

status provide the marginal tax rates assigned to each family.   These

calculated rates span the entire range from zero to fifty percent.

                                   Notes




   1.   In general, under the Canadian plan persons can contribute 20 percent

of income up to a maximum of $3500 for those with a private pension plan and

$5500 for those without a private plan.


    2. This may be contrasted with portfolio composition analysis most

recently represented in the work by King and Leape [1984] or earlier work by

Feldstein [1976] for example.


    3. Given current income, contributions to tax deferred accounts could

of course be taken partially or entirely from other existing asset

balances. The identification problem is to determine whether this is the

case. It is not possible to address this issue with the CF'S data, but it

will be considered in subsequent analysis based on other data sources.


    4. As far as we know, a model like this one has not been estimated.

In any event, data limitations and other choices in the empirical

implementation would undoubtedly leave uncertainty about the effect of tax

deferred accounts, as well as the effect on tax-deferred contributions of

changes in the contribution limits. Answers to these questions are

important in their own right and can be answered with considerable

confidence.


     5. By referring back to figure 2, one can see the difference between

 these procedures. If all the data are used, then there is a concentration
                                                         -48â€”



 of observations at zero and at L.                       If the zero observations are deleted,

 there is no concentration of data points at zero, but the distribution is

 truncated at this point and the concentration at L remains.                      The third

 procedure only considers whether contributions are zero or not.


     6. The preference function that corresponds to (7) is

         V(Ys,s) =     (S/)e         +



where    a=au +ax +...a.x,
                       KK  +c.andyb+n

    7.   The estimates are in fact negative but not statistically different

from zero.


    8. Given program limits, the estimated parameters, and values of X for

each member of the sample, the expected contribution of each individual or

family is (following the notation of appendix B):


          E(c) =   Pr[C       0].E[C I       C   c   0)

               +   Pr[0   < C   <   L].      E[C 0 <            C <   L]

               +   Pr[C   ?   L].E[C     I
                                             C   ?   U




               =   (X).(()               -



               + g[(X)          â€”   â€¢(â€”)] + [1                  -     ____


    9.   This estimate may be compared to the average IRA deduction based

on IRS wage and salary returns which was $340 for 1982.
                                       -49-




   10. Note this lack of information poses a problem for prediction but

not for estimation. The statistical model used to obtain parameter

estimates assigns all married persons an open-ended upper limit of

$2000 or more.


   11. The implied correlation between (riY +      c)   and (rY +        is   about

-0.01.


   12. It may be noticed that the sum of the individual likelihood

functions is 9490.5, whereas the likelihood value for the joint

specification is somewhat higher, 9497.8. The higher likelihood value

results from the equal variance restrictions on ri and the exclusion of

education from the contribution equation.


   13. Indeed for some years the estimated effect in Canada is in fact

negative, although not statistically different from zero.


   14. Strictly speaking, the simulations indicate that had the Treasury

proposal been implemented in 1982, contributions would have been 30 percent

higher than they were.


   15. In principle the open intervals can be treated as closed intervals

by setting limits of -   or   .   We   treat open and closed intervals

separately for expositional purposes only.


   16. To simplify matters this appendix derives likelihood functions for

a linear specification of Si and a homoscedastic error structure. The
                                               â€”50--




 estimated model is based on the parameter and error structure given by

 equation (5) in the text.


    17. In practice, this model is also estimated with a nonlinear

 specification with a heteroscedastic error
                                                          structure, with equations
analagous to those in the text.


    18. First consider the C = 0 case. Under the limiting case, the

probability of S greater than zero and C less than zero goes to zero

because this would be an outcome with
                                                   zero likelihood. Thus, the bivariate
distribution function drops out. The Lt1 <                 C <         and C =           cases
                                                                  Lt                L1
can be rewritten as Pr[S >                   < C   <                       c
                                      OILt             Lt].Pr[L    1
                                                                       <       <
                                                                                   L]
and Pr(S >   olc   >
                       L1).Pr[C   >
                                      L.J respectively. The first term in each case
goes to unity in the limiting case, since if C is greater than some positive

Lt, S must also be greater than zero. Thus in both cases the bivar-iate

distribution in the last term of likelihoods
                                                           reduces to expressions containing
only univariate cumulative distributions.


   19. For example, we eliminated
                                             persons married but living in a single
person household. Heads with the other relatives but not married were

treated as single persons.
