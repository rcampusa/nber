                                              ABSTRACT

Bank failures during banking crises, in theory, can result either from unwarranted depositor withdrawals
during events characterized by contagion or panic, or as the result of fundamental bank insolvency.
Various views of contagion are described and compared to historical evidence from banking crises,
with special emphasis on the U.S. experience during and prior to the Great Depression. Panics or "contagion"
played a small role in bank failure, during or before the Great Depression-era distress. Ironically, the
government safety net, which was designed to forestall the (overestimated) risks of contagion, seems
to have become the primary source of systemic instability in banking in the current era.

“Contagion” vs. Fundamentals as Causes of Bank Failures

       Concerns about the susceptibility of banks to unwarranted withdrawals of

deposits during panics, the possibility of bank failures and contractions of bank

credit resulting from unwarranted withdrawals of deposits (which is sometimes

described as the result of “contagious” weakness among banks), and the attendant

adverse macroeconomic consequences of bank disappearance or bank balance sheet

contraction have motivated much of the public policies toward banks. Those policies

include assistance mechanisms intended to protect banks from unwarranted

withdrawals of deposits (central bank lending during crises, deposit insurance, and

government-sponsored bank bailouts), and a host of prudential regulatory policies

(intended to promote banking system stability, and especially to prevent banks from

taking advantage of government protection by increasing their riskiness – the so-

called “moral-hazard” problem of protection).

       Theoretical models have been devised in which banking crises result from

systemic “contagion,” when banks that are intrinsically solvent are subjected to

large unwarranted withdrawals, and may fail as a consequence of this withdrawal

pressure. Advocates of the view that banking systems are inherently vulnerable to

such contagion often emphasize that the structure of banks – the financing of

illiquid assets with demandable debts, and the “sequential service constraint”

(which mandates that depositors who are first in line receive all of their deposits)

– tends to aggravate the tendency for unwarranted withdrawals (see Douglas W.

Diamond and Phillip H. Dybvig 1983, Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale 2000,

Douglas W. Diamond and Raghuram Rajan 2002).


                                                                                       3
       Unwarranted withdrawals (that is, those unrelated to the solvency of the bank)

can occur, in theory, for a number of reasons. Diamond and Dybvig (1983) develop a

banking model with multiple equilibria, where one of the equilibria is a systemic

bank run, which occurs simply because depositors believe that others will run. More

generally, observers of historical panics sometimes document depositors imitating

each other’s withdrawal behavior; depositors may line up to withdraw their funds

simply because others are doing so, particularly in light of the incentives implied by

the sequential service constraint. It is important to recognize, however, that evidence

about mimetic withdrawals does not generally confirm the all-or-nothing runs by all

depositors imagined by some theoretical models; rather, mimesis may be partial and

gradual (see O’Grada and White 2003, and Bruner and Carr 2007).

        A second possibility, which is particularly relevant for understanding pre-

World War I banking panics in the U.S. (e.g., the nationwide U.S. Panics of 1857,

1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, 1907, and some events during the Great Depression,

including the Chicago banking panic of June 1932), is that a signal is received by

depositors, which contains noisy information about the health of the various banks.

Depositors have reason to believe that a loss has occurred that might cause a bank to

become insolvent, but they cannot observe which bank has suffered the loss. In that

circumstance, depositors may withdraw large amounts of funds from all banks,

including those that are (unobservably) solvent, simply because they would rather

not risk leaving their money in a bank that turns out to be insolvent.

         Third, exogenous shocks to depositors’ liquidity preferences, or to the supply

of reserves in the banking system, unrelated to banks’ asset condition, may cause an



                                                                                          4
excess demand for cash on the part of depositors relative to existing reserves, which

can lead banks to a scramble for reserves, which can produce systemic runs (a

banking version of the game “musical chairs”). Liquidity demand and supply shocks

may be related to government policies affecting the reserve market, or to foreign

exchange risks that lead depositors to want to convert to cash. This mechanism may

have had a role in some banking system crises (notably, the nationwide U.S. Panics

of 1837 and 1933).

       Withdrawal pressures, whether they are associated with warranted or

unwarranted withdrawals, can accumulate over time or can take the extreme form of

a “bank run” (when depositors decide en masse to remove deposits). Some financial

historians (notably Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz 1963) have pointed to the

Great Depression of the 1930s as a time when unwarranted depositor withdrawals,

and sometimes “runs” or “panics,” led to large numbers of bank failures, and rapid

declines in deposits of solvent and insolvent banks alike. Bank distress is associated

not only with bank failures, but with general macroeconomic consequences resulting

from the reduced supply of loans and deposits, which can amplify business cycle

downturns and spread panic-induced financial distress from banks to the whole

economy (Ben Bernanke 1983, Charles Calomiris and Joseph Mason 2003b). Other

episodes of banking panics outside the Great Depression have also been identified as

possible episodes of unwarranted bank failures, especially in the United States

during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with similar inferences drawn by

some about the contagious causes and costly consequences of bank distress.




                                                                                         5
       Another view of banking distress (which I will label the “fundamentalist,” as

opposed to the “panic,” approach), stresses a different direction of causality: a chain

of causation from non-panic-related, observable, exogenous adverse changes in the

economic conditions of banks, to intrinsic weakening of bank condition, ultimately

leading to bank failure. According to this view, fundamental losses to bank

borrowers cause losses to banks, which may bankrupt some banks and lead other

weakened banks to curtail the supplies of loans and deposits as part of a rebalancing

of portfolios to limit default risk in a disciplined market (Calomiris and Wilson

2004). Endogenous contractions of deposits and loans, just like unwarranted

contractions, will limit the supply of money and credit, and thus they will exacerbate

the macroeconomic decline that caused them. Thus, according to the fundamentalist

view, banking distress can magnify economic downturns even if banks are not the

originators of shocks; banks will tend to magnify macroeconomic shocks through

their prudential decisions to curtail the supplies of loans and deposits in response to

adverse shocks, even if banks are passive responders to shocks and even if

depositors avoid engaging in unwarranted runs or panics.

       Differences in opinion about the sources of shocks that cause bank failures

have important implications for policy. While both the panic and fundamentalist

views can be used to motivate public policy to protect banks (since both views see

banks as important magnifiers of macroeconomic disturbance), the panic view

provides special motives for public policies to protect banks from withdrawal risk.

The fundamentalist view, in contrast, sees banks as inherently stable – that is, neither

victims of unwarranted withdrawals, nor a major source of macroeconomic shocks.



                                                                                          6
According to the fundamentalist view, market discipline of banks is not random, and

indeed, helps preserve efficiency in the banking system. It may be desirable to limit

or even avoid government protection of banks to preserve market discipline in

banking (making banks more vulnerable to the risk of depositor withdrawal).

Preserving market discipline encourages good risk management by banks, even

though bank deposit and credit contractions attendant to adverse economic shocks to

bank borrowers may aggravate business cycles. Indeed, some empirical studies have

argued that policies that insulate banks from market discipline tend to produce worse

magnifications of downturns, due to excessive bank risk taking in response to

protection (for example, John Boyd, Pedro Gomis, Sungkyu Kwak and Bruce Smith

2000, and James Barth, Gerard Caprio, and Ross Levine 2006).

       These two views of the sources of bank distress (the panic view that banks

are fragile and highly subject to panic, or alternatively, the fundamentalist view that

banks are stable and generally not subject to unwarranted large-scale withdrawals)

do not define the universe of possibilities. One or the other extreme view may do a

better job explaining different historical crises, and both fundamentals and

unwarranted withdrawals may play a role during some banking crises. The recent

empirical literature on banking crises has tried to come to grips with the causes and

effects of systemic bank failures in different places and times, to ascertain the

dominant causal connections relating banking distress and macroeconomic decline,

and to try to draw inferences about the appropriate public policy posture toward

banks. The remainder of this chapter selectively reviews the empirical literature on

the causes of bank failures during systemic banking crises. This review begins with a



                                                                                          7
lengthy discussion of the Great Depression in the United States, which is followed

by a discussion of U.S. bank distress prior to the Depression, historical bank distress

outsides the United States, and contemporary banking system distress (which is

discussed more fully in Chapter 26 of this volume, by Gerard Caprio and Patrick

Honohan).



U.S. Bank Distress during the Great Depression

       The list of fundamental shocks that may have weakened banks during the

Great Depression is a long and varied one. It includes declines in the value of bank

loan portfolios produced by waves of rising default risk in the wake of regional,

sectoral, or national macroeconomic shocks to bank borrowers, as well as monetary

policy-induced declines in the prices of the bonds held by banks. There is no doubt

that adverse fundamental shocks relevant to bank solvency were contributors to bank

distress; the controversy is over the size of these fundamental shocks – that is,

whether banks experiencing distress were truly insolvent or simply illiquid.

       Friedman and Schwartz (1963) are the most prominent advocates of the view

that many bank failures resulted from unwarranted “panic” and that failing banks

were in large measure illiquid rather than insolvent. Friedman and Schwartz attach

great importance to the banking crisis of late 1930, which they attribute to a

“contagion of fear” that resulted from the failure of a large New York bank, the

Bank of United States, which they regard as itself a victim of panic.

       They also identify two other banking crises in 1931 – from March to August

1931, and from Britain’s departure from the gold standard (September 21, 1931)



                                                                                       8
through the end of the year. The fourth and final banking crisis they identify

occurred at the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, culminating in the

nationwide suspension of banks in March. The 1933 crisis and suspension was the

beginning of the end of the Depression, but the 1930 and 1931 crises (because they

did not result in suspension) were, in Friedman and Schwartz’s judgment, important

sources of shock to the real economy that turned a recession in 1929 into the Great

Depression of 1929-1933.

       The Friedman and Schwartz argument is based upon the suddenness of

banking distress during the panics that they identify, and the absence of collapses in

relevant macroeconomic time series prior to those banking crises (see Charts 27-30

in Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 309). But there are reasons to question Friedman

and Schwartz’s view of the exogenous origins of the banking crises of the

Depression. As Peter Temin (1976) and many others have noted, the bank failures

during the Depression marked a continuation of the severe banking sector distress

that had gripped agricultural regions throughout the 1920s. Of the nearly 15,000

bank disappearances that occurred between 1920 and 1933, roughly half predate

1930. And massive numbers of bank failures occurred during the Depression era

outside the crisis windows identified by Friedman and Schwartz (notably, in 1932).

Elmus Wicker (1996, p. 1) estimates that “[b]etween 1930 and 1932 of the more than

5,000 banks that closed only 38 percent suspended during the first three banking

crisis episodes.” Recent studies of the condition of the Bank of United States indicate

that it too may have been insolvent, not just illiquid, in December 1930 (Joseph

Lucia 1985, Wicker 1996). So there is some prima facie evidence that the banking



                                                                                         9
distress of the Depression era was more than a problem of panic-inspired depositor

flight.

          But how can one attribute bank failures during the Depression mainly to

fundamentals when Friedman and Schwartz’s time series evidence indicates no prior

changes in macroeconomic fundamentals? Friedman and Schwartz omitted

important aggregate measures of the state of the economy relevant for bank

solvency, for example, measures of commercial distress and construction activity

may be useful indicators of fundamental shocks. Second, aggregation of

fundamentals masks important sectoral, local, and regional shocks that buffeted

banks with particular credit or market risks. The empirical relevance of these factors

has been demonstrated in the work of Wicker (1980, 1996) and Calomiris and

Mason (1997, 2003a).

          Using a narrative approach similar to that of Friedman and Schwartz, but

relying on data disaggregated to the level of the Federal Reserve districts and on

local newspaper accounts of banking distress, Wicker argues that it is incorrect to

identify the banking crisis of 1930 and the first banking crisis of 1931 as national

panics comparable to those of the pre-Fed era. According to Wicker, the proper way

to understand the process of banking failure during the Depression is to

disaggregate, both by region and by bank, because heterogeneity was very important

in determining the incidence of bank failures.

          Once one disaggregates, Wicker argues, it becomes apparent that at least the

first two of the three banking crises of 1930-1931 identified by Friedman and

Schwartz were largely regional affairs. Wicker (1980, 1996) argues that the failures



                                                                                       10
of November 1930 reflected regional shocks and the specific risk exposures of a

small subset of banks, linked to Nashville-based Caldwell & Co., the largest

investment bank in the South at the time of its failure. Temin (1989, p. 50) reaches a

similar conclusion. He argues that the “panic” of 1930 was not really a panic, and

that the failure of Caldwell & Co. and the Bank of United States reflected

fundamental weakness in those institutions.

        Wicker’s analysis of the third banking crisis (beginning September 1931)

also shows that bank suspensions were concentrated in a very few locales, although

he regards the nationwide increase in the tendency to convert deposits into cash as

evidence of a possible nationwide banking crisis in September and October 1931.

Wicker agrees with Friedman and Schwartz that the final banking crisis (of 1933),

which resulted in universal suspension of bank operations, was nationwide in scope.

The banking crisis that culminated in the bank holidays of February-March 1933

resulted in the suspension of at least some bank operations (bank “holidays”) for

nearly all banks in the country by March 6.

        From the regionally disaggregated perspective of Wicker’s findings, the

inability to explain the timing of bank failures using aggregate time series data

(which underlay the Friedman Schwartz view that banking failures were an

unwarranted and autonomous source of shock) would not be surprising even if bank

failures were entirely due to fundamental insolvency. Failures of banks were local

phenomena in 1930 and 1931, and so may have had little to do with national shocks

to income, the price level, interest rates, and asset prices.




                                                                                      11
       The unique industrial organization of the American banking industry plays a

central role in both the Wicker view of the process of bank failure during the

Depression, and in the ability to detect that process empirically. Banks in the United

States (unlike banks in other countries) did not operate throughout the country. They

were smaller, regionally isolated institutions. In the United States, therefore, large

region-specific shocks might produce a sudden wave of bank failures in specific

regions even though no evidence of a shock was visible in aggregate macroeconomic

time series (see the cross-country evidence in Ben S. Bernanke and Harold James

1991, and Richard S. Grossman 1994). The regional isolation of banks in the United

States, due to prohibitions on nationwide branching or even statewide branching in

most states, also makes it possible to identify regional shocks empirically through

their observed effects on banks located exclusively in particular regions.

       Microeconomic studies of banking distress have provided some useful

evidence on the reactions of individual banks to economic distress. Eugene N. White

(1984) shows that the failures of banks in 1930 are best explained as a continuation

of the agricultural distress of the 1920s, and are traceable to fundamental

disturbances in agricultural markets.

       Calomiris and Mason (1997) study the Chicago banking panic of June 1932

(a locally isolated phenomenon). They find that the panic resulted in a temporary

contraction of deposits that affected both solvent and insolvent banks, and in that

sense, unwarranted deposit contraction did occur. Fundamentals, however,

determined which banks survived. Apparently, no solvent banks failed during that

panic. Banks that failed during the panic were observably weaker ex ante, judging



                                                                                         12
from their balance sheet and income statements, and from the default risk premia

they paid on their debts. Furthermore, the rate of deposit contraction was not

identical across banks; deposits declined more in failing weak banks than in

surviving banks.

       Calomiris and Berry Wilson (2004) study the behavior of New York City

banks during the interwar period, and in particular, analyze the contraction of their

lending during the 1930s. They find that banking distress was an informed market

response to observable weaknesses in particular banks, traceable to ex ante bank

characteristics. It resulted in bank balance sheet contraction, but this varied greatly

across banks; banks with higher default risk were disciplined more by the market

(that is, experienced greater deposit withdrawals), which encouraged them to target a

low-risk of default.

       Calomiris and Mason (2003a) construct a survival duration model of Fed

member banks throughout the country from 1929 to 1933. This model combines

aggregate data at the national, state, and county level with bank-specific data on

balance sheets and income statements to identify the key contributors to bank failure

risk and to gauge the relative importance of fundamentals and panics as explanations

of bank failure. Calomiris and Mason find that a fundamentals-based model can

explain most of the failure experience of banks in the U.S. prior to 1933. They

identify a significant, but small, national panic effect around September of 1931, and

some isolated regional effects that may have been panics, but prior to 1933, banking

panics were not very important contributors to bank failures compared to

fundamentals.



                                                                                          13
        The fact that a consistent model based on fundamentals can explain the vast

majority of U.S. bank failures prior to 1933 has interesting implications. First, it

indicates that the influence of banking panics as an independent source of shock to

the economy was not important early in the Depression. Only in 1933, at the trough

of the Depression, did failure risk become importantly de-linked from local,

regional, and national economic conditions and from fundamentals relating to

individual bank structure and performance. Second, the timing of this observed rise

in risk unrelated to indicators of credit risk is itself interesting. In late 1932 and early

1933, currency risk became increasingly important; depositors had reason to fear

that President Roosevelt would leave the gold standard, which gave them a special

reason to want to convert their deposits into (high-valued) dollars before devaluation

of the dollar (Barry Wigmore 1987). Currency risk, of course, is also a fundamental.

        It is also interesting to connect this account of bank distress during the

Depression – which emphasizes fundamental shocks, rather than simply illiquidity,

as the source of bank distress – with the history of lender of last resort assistance to

banks during the Depression. Many commentators have faulted the Federal Reserve

for failing to prevent bank failures with more aggressive discount window lending.

While it is certainly true that expansionary monetary policy, particularly in 1929-31,

could have made an enormous difference in preventing bank distress (through its

effects on macroeconomic fundamentals), that is not the same as saying that more

generous terms at the discount window (holding constant the overall monetary

policy stance) would have made much of a difference. Discount window lending

only helps preserve banks that are suffering from illiquidity, which was not the



                                                                                          14
problem for most banks in the 1930s that were experiencing large depositor

withdrawals.

       Indeed, in 1932, President Hoover created the Reconstruction Finance

Corporation (RFC), to enlarge the potential availability of liquidity, but this

additional source of liquidity assistance made no difference in helping borrowing

banks avoid failure (Mason 2001). Commentators at the time noted that, because the

collateralized RFC and Fed loans were senior to deposits, and because depositor

withdrawals from weak banks reflected real concerns about bank insolvency, loans

from the Fed and the RFC to banks experiencing withdrawals did nothing to help,

and actually often did harm to banks, since those senior loans from the Fed and the

RFC reduced the amount of high quality assets available to back deposits, which

actually increased the riskiness of deposits and created new incentives for deposit

withdrawals. In 1933, however, once the RFC was permitted to purchase preferred

stock of financial institutions (which was junior to depositors), RFC assistance to

troubled banks was effective in reducing the risk of failure (Mason 2001).



Microeconomic Studies of Local Contagion

       As part of their bank-level analysis of survival duration, Calomiris and

Mason (2003a) also consider whether, outside the windows of “panics” identified by

Friedman and Schwartz, the occurrence of bank failures in close proximity to a bank

affects the probability of survival of the bank, after taking into account the various

fundamental determinants of failure. Calomiris and Mason recognize that this

measure of “contagious failure” is an upper bound, since in part it measures



                                                                                         15
unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity common to banks located in the same area,

in addition to true contagion. They find small, but statistically significant, effects

associated with this measure. The omission of this variable from the analysis raises

forecasted survival duration by an average of 0.2%. They also consider other

regional dummy variables associated with Wicker’s (1996) instances of identified

regional panics, and again find effects on bank failure risk that are small in national

importance.

       Cormac O’Grada and Eugene White (2003) provide a detailed account of

depositor behavior based on individual account data during the 1850s for a single

bank, the Emigrant Savings Bank of New York, which offers a unique perspective

on depositor contagion during banking panics. In 1854, Emigrant experienced an

unwarranted run that can be traced to mimetic behavior among inexperienced,

uninformed depositors. This run, however, was easily handled by the bank, which

was able to pay off depositors and restore confidence. In contrast, the run in 1857

was an imitative response to the behavior of informed, sophisticated depositors who

were running for a reason, and that run resulted in suspension of convertibility.

Furthermore, in both of these episodes, mimesis was not sudden: “In neither 1854

nor 1857 did depositors respond to a single signal that led them to crowd into banks

all at once. Instead, panics lasted a few weeks, building and sometimes ebbing in

intensity, and only a fraction of all accounts were closed” (p. 215). O’Grada and

White show that contagion can be a real contributor to bank distress, but they also

show that runs based on random beliefs tend to dissipate with little effect, while runs

based on legitimate signals tend to grow in importance over time. The fact that runs



                                                                                         16
are not sudden, and that many depositors do not participate in them at all, is

important, since it implies the ability of events to unfold over time; that is, for a form

of collective learning among depositors to take place during panics.

       A similar account of mimetic withdrawals based on a random rumor can be

found in an article by Henry Nicholas in Moody’s Magazine in 1907. A bank in

Tarpen Springs, Florida experienced an unwarranted outflow of deposits based on a

false rumor that was spread through the local Greek-American community, which

included many of the bank’s depositors. The bank quickly wired to have cash sent

from its correspondent bank, which arrived in time to prevent any suspension of

convertibility, and brought the run to an end. Nicholas noted that, if the bank had

really been in trouble, not only would the correspondent not have provided the

funds, but it and other banks would have probably withdrawn any funds it had on

deposit at the bank long before the public was aware of the problem (a so-called

“silent run;” see the related discussions in Halac and Schmukler 2004, and Stern and

Feldman 2003).



U.S. Bank Distress in the Pre-Depression Era

       As many scholars have recognized for many years, for structural reasons,

U.S. banks were unusually vulnerable to systemic banking crises that saw large

numbers of bank failures before the Depression, compared to banks in other

countries (for reviews, see Michael Bordo 1985, and Calomiris 2000). Calomiris

and Gary Gorton (1991) identify six episodes of particularly severe banking panics

in the United States between the Civil War and World War I., and prior to the Civil



                                                                                       17
War, there were other nationwide banking crises in 1819, 1837, and 1857. In the

1920s, the U.S. experienced waves of bank failures in agricultural states, which have

always been identified with fundamental shocks to banks, rather than national or

regional panics. Other countries, including the U.S.’s northern neighbor, Canada,

however, did not suffer banking crises during these episodes of systemic U.S.

banking system distress. The key difference between the U.S. and other countries

historically was the structure of the U.S. banking system. The U.S. system was

mainly based on unit banking – geographically isolated single-office banks; no other

country in the world imitated that approach to banking, and no other country

experienced the U.S. pattern of periodic banking panics prior to World War I, or the

waves of agricultural bank failures that gripped the U.S. in the 1920s.

       Canada’s early decision to permit branch banking throughout the country

ensured that banks were geographically diversified and thus resilient to large

sectoral shocks (like those to agriculture in the 1920s and 1930s), able to compete

through the establishment of branches in rural areas (because of low overhead costs

of establishing additional branches), and able to coordinate the banking system’s

response in moments of confusion to avoid depositor runs (the number of banks was

small, and assets were highly concentrated in several nationwide institutions).

Coordination among banks facilitated systemic stability by allowing banks to

manage incipient panic episodes to prevent widespread bank runs. In Canada, the

Bank of Montreal occasionally would coordinate actions by the large Canadian

banks to stop crises before the public was even aware of a possible threat.




                                                                                      18
       The United States was unable to mimic this behavior on a national or

regional scale (Calomiris 2000, Calomiris and Schweikart 1991). U.S. law

prohibited nationwide branching, and most states prohibited or limited within-state

branching. U.S. banks, in contrast to banks elsewhere, were numerous (e.g.,

numbering more than 29,000 in 1920), undiversified, insulated from competition,

and geographically isolated from one another, thus were unable to diversify

adequately or to coordinate their response to panics (U.S. banks did establish

clearing houses in cities, which facilitated local responses to panics beginning in the

1850s, as emphasized by Gorton 1985).

       The structure of U.S. banking explains why the United States uniquely

suffered banking panics despite the fact that the vast majority of banks were healthy,

and were able to avoid ultimate failure. Empirical studies show that the major U.S.

banking panics of 1857, 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, 1896, and 1907 were moments of

heightened asymmetric information about bank risk. Banking necessarily entails the

delegation of decision making to bankers, who specialize in screening and

monitoring borrowers and making non-transparent investments. Bankers

consequently have private information about the attendant risks. During normal

times, the risk premium banks pay in capital markets and money markets contains a

small “opacity” premium – part of the risk depositors and bank stockholders face

and charge for comes from not being able to observe the value of bank assets

moment to moment – that is, not being able to mark bank portfolios to market.

During the U.S. panics, the normally small opacity premium became very large, as

people became aware that risks had increased and as they also were aware of what



                                                                                      19
they didn’t know, namely the incidence among banks of the probable losses that

accompanied the observable increased risk.

       Calomiris and Gorton (1991) show that banking panics were uniquely

predictable events that happened at business cycle peaks. In the pre- World War I

period (1875-1913), every quarter in which the liabilities of failed businesses rose by

more than 50% (seasonally adjusted) and the stock market fell by more than 8%, a

panic happened in the following quarter. This happened five times, and the Panic of

1907 was the last of those times. Significant national panics (i.e., events that gave

rise to a collective response by the New York Clearing House) never happened

otherwise during this period.

       Bank failure rates, even during these panic episodes, were small, and the

losses to depositors associated with them were also small. In 1893, the panic with

the highest failure rate and highest depositor loss rate, depositor losses were less

than 0.1% of GDP (Calomiris 2007). Expected depositor losses during the panics

also appear to have been small. Oliver Sprague (1910, pp. 57-8, 423-24) reports that

the discount applied to bankers’ cashier checks of New York City banks at the

height of the Panic of 1873 did not exceed 3.5% and with the exception of an initial

10-day period remained below 1%, and a similar pattern was visible in the Panic of

1893. A 1% premium would be consistent with depositors in a New York City bank

estimating a 10% chance of a bank’s failing with a 10% depositor loss if it failed.

Clearly, banking panics during this era were traceable to real shocks, but those

shocks had small consequences for bank failures in the aggregate and even at the

height of the crisis those consequences were expected to be small. Historical U.S.



                                                                                        20
panics teach us that even a small expected loss can lead depositors to demand their

funds, so that they can sit on the sidelines until the incidence of loss within the

banking system has been revealed (usually a process that took a matter of weeks).

       Bank failure rates in the 1830s and the 1920s were much higher than those of

the other pre-Depression systemic U.S. banking crisis episodes. The 1830s saw a

major macroeconomic contraction that caused many banks to fail, which historians

trace to large fundamental problems that had their sources in government-induced

shocks to the money supply (Peter Rousseau 2002), unprofitable bank-financed

infrastructure investments that went sour (Schweikart 1988), and international

balance of payments shocks (Peter Temin 1969). The 1920s agricultural bank

failures were also closely linked to fundamental problems, in this case, the collapses

of agricultural prices at the end of World War I, which were manifested in local bank

failures in the absence of regional or national bank portfolio diversification

(Calomiris 1992, Lee Alston, Wayne Grove and Davoid Wheelock 1994).



Other Historical Experiences with Bank Failures

       Although the U.S. was unique in its propensity for panics, it was not the only

economy to experience occasional waves of bank failures historically. Losses (i.e.,

the negative net worth of failed banks), however, were generally modest and bank

failure rates were much lower outside the U.S. The most severe cases of banking

distress during this era, Argentina in 1890 and Australia in 1893, were the

exceptional cases; they suffered banking system losses of roughly 10% of GDP in

the wake of real estate market collapses in those countries. The negative net worth of



                                                                                      21
failed banks in Norway in 1900 were 3% and in Italy in 1893 1% of GDP, but with

the possible exception of Brazil (for which data do not exist to measure losses),

there were no other cases in 1875-1913 in which banking losses in a country

exceeded 1% of GDP (Calomiris 2007).

       Loss rates tended to be low because banks structured themselves to limit

their risk of loss by maintaining adequate equity-to-assets ratios, sufficiently low

asset risk, and adequate liquidity. Market discipline (the potential for depositors

fearful of bank default to withdraw their funds) provided incentives for banks to

behave prudently (for a theoretical framework, see Calomiris and Charles Kahn

1991). The picture of small depositors lining up around the block to withdraw funds

has received much attention by journalists and banking theorists, but perhaps the

more important source of market discipline was the threat of an informed (“silent”)

run by large depositors (often other banks). Banks maintained relationships with

each other through interbank deposits and the clearing of deposits, notes, and

bankers’ bills. Banks often belonged to clearing houses that set regulations and

monitored members’ behavior. A bank that lost the trust of its fellow bankers could

not long survive.



Bank Failures in the Late 20th Century

        Recent research on systemic bank failures has emphasized the destabilizing

effects of bank safety nets. This has been informed by the experience of the U.S.

Savings and Loan industry debacle of the 1980s, the banking collapses in Japan and

Scandinavia during the 1990s, and similar banking system debacles occurring in 140



                                                                                       22
developing countries in the last two decades of the 20th century, all of which

experienced banking system losses in excess of 1% of GDP, and more than 20 of

which experienced losses in excess of 10% of GDP (data are from Caprio and

Klingebiel 1996, updated in private correspondence with these authors). Empirical

studies of these unprecedented losses concluded that deposit insurance and other

policies that protect banks from market discipline, intended as a cure for instability,

have instead become the single greatest source of banking instability.

       The theory behind the problem of destabilizing protection has been well-

known for over a century, and was the basis for Franklin Roosevelt’s opposition to

deposit insurance in 1933 (an opposition shared by many). Ironically, federal deposit

insurance is one of the major legacies of the Roosevelt presidency, despite the fact

that President Roosevelt, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and Senator Carter

Glass – the primary authorities on banking policy of the time – all were opposed to it

on principle. Deposit insurance was seen by them and others as undesirable special

interest legislation designed to benefit small banks. They acquiesced in its passage

for practical reasons, to get other legislation passed, not because they wanted deposit

insurance to pass per se. Numerous attempts, dating from the 1880s, to introduce

federal deposit insurance legislation failed to attract support in the Congress

(Calomiris and White 1994). Opponents understood the theoretical arguments

against deposit insurance espoused today – that deposit insurance removes

depositors’ incentives to monitor and discipline banks, and frees bankers to take

imprudent risks (especially when they have little or no remaining equity at stake, and




                                                                                       23
see an advantage in “resurrection risk taking”); and that the absence of discipline

also promotes banker incompetence, which leads to unwitting risk taking.

       Research on the banking collapses of the last two decades of the twentieth

century have produced new empirical findings indicating that the greater the

protection offered by a country’s bank safety net, the greater the risk of a banking

collapse (see, for example, Caprio and Klingebiel 1996, Boyd et al. 2000, Demirguc-

Kunt Detragiache 2000, and Barth et al. 2006). Empirical research on prudential

bank regulation similarly emphasizes the importance of subjecting some bank

liabilities to the risk of loss to promote discipline and limit risk taking (Shadow

Financial Regulatory Committee 2000, Mishkin 2001, Barth et al. 2006).

       Studies of historical deposit insurance reinforce these conclusions (Calomiris

1990). The basis for the opposition to deposit insurance in the 1930s was the

disastrous experimentation with insurance in several U.S. states during the early 20th

century, which resulted in banking collapses in all the states that adopted insurance.

Government protection of banks had played a similarly destabilizing role in

Argentina in the 1880s (leading to the 1890 collapse) and in Italy (leading to its

1893 crisis). In retrospect, the successful period of U.S. deposit insurance, from

1933 through the 1960s, was an aberration, reflecting limited insurance during those

years (insurance limits were subsequently increased), and the unusual

macroeconomic stability of the era.




                                                                                       24
Conclusion

       Banking failures, in theory, can be a consequence either of fundamental,

exogenous shocks to banks, or alternatively, unwarranted withdrawals by depositors

associated with contagions of fear, or panics. Interestingly, although many

economists associate contagions of fear with the banking distress of the Great

Depression, empirical research indicates that panics played a small role in

Depression-era distress, which was mainly confined to regional episodes (e.g., June

1932 in Chicago) or to the banking collapse of 1933.

       More importantly, empirical research on banking distress clearly shows that

panics are neither random events nor inherent to the function of banks or the

structure of bank balance sheets. Panics in the U.S. were generally not associated

with massive bank failures, but rather were times of temporary confusion about the

incidence of shocks within the banking system. This asymmetric-information

problem was particularly severe in the U.S. For the late-nineteenth and early

twentieth centuries, system-wide banking panics like those that the U.S. experienced

in that period did not occur elsewhere. The uniquely panic-ridden experience of the

U.S., particularly during the pre-World War I era, reflected the unit banking

structure of the U.S. system. Panics were generally avoided by other countries in the

pre-World War I era because their banking systems were composed of a much

smaller number of banks operated on a national basis, who consequently enjoyed

greater portfolio diversification ex ante, and a greater ability to coordinate their

actions to stem panics ex post. The U.S. also experienced waves of bank failures

unrelated to panics (most notably in the 1920s), which reflected the vulnerability to



                                                                                       25
sector-specific shocks (e.g., agricultural price declines) in an undiversified banking

system.

       More recent banking system experience worldwide indicates unprecedented

costs of banking system distress – an unprecedented high frequency of banking

crises, many bank failures, and large losses by failing banks, sometimes with

disastrous costs to taxpayers who end up footing the bill of bank loss. This new

phenomenon has been traced empirically to the expanded role of the government

safety net. Government protection removes the effect of market discipline. It thereby

encourages excessive risk taking by banks, and also creates greater tolerance for

incompetent risk management (as distinct from purposeful increases in risk).

Ironically, the government safety net, which was designed to forestall the

(overestimated) risks of contagion seems to have become the primary source of

systemic instability in banking.
