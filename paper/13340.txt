A serious difficulty in determining the importance of credit constraints in education arises because
standard data sources do not provide a direct way of identifying which students are credit constrained.
This has forced researchers to adopt a variety of indirect approaches. This paper differentiates itself
from previous work by taking a direct approach for providing evidence about this issue which is made
possible by unique longitudinal data that have been collected specifically for this type of purpose.
Our results suggest that, while credit constraints likely play an important role in the drop-out decisions
of some students, the large majority of attrition of students from low income families should be primarily
attributed to reasons other than credit constraints.

I. Introduction

         Children from low income families are much less likely than other students to attend and graduate

from college (Manski, 1992). Recent literature has emphasized the importance of understanding the extent

to which “short-run” credit constraints that are present during college contribute to this reality. These types

of credit constraints could play an important role by making it difficult for students to pay tuition or other

direct costs of college attendance. These types of credit constraints could also operate by making it difficult

for students to find money to pay for consumption during college, in which case constrained students may

not be able to smooth consumption as much as they would like between the schooling and working portions

of their lives. The potential importance of the former avenue has been frequently discussed by policymakers.

The potential importance of the latter avenue arises because, while grant, loan, and work-study programs exist

to help students pay the direct costs of college, these types of programs are not typically designed to help

students replace consumption that may be lost when individuals forego earnings during college.1

         As described in Cameron and Taber (2004), a serious difficulty in determining the extent to which

access to credit influences educational outcomes arises because standard data sources do not provide a direct

way of identifying which students are credit constrained. This has forced researchers to suggest and explore

a variety of indirect approaches (Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998),Card (1995), Lang (1993), Cameron

and Heckman (1998, 2001), Carneiro and Heckman (2005), Kane (1996), and Keane and Wolpin (2001)).

Given that these indirect approaches rely on different underlying assumptions, it is not surprising that the

approaches have produced different conclusions and uncertainty about the importance of credit constraints

remains (Kane, 2005).

1
 While this paper examines the importance of short-run (binding) constraints that may be present during college, there
exist other types of credit constraints that could influence higher educational attainment. For example, family
constraints during a child’s youth could influence higher educational attainment of the child by affecting his/her human
capital accumulation at the time of high school graduation (Cameron and Heckman, 1998, Restuccia, 2004). In
addition, the possibility that an individual may have difficulty borrowing money after college if he/she has difficulty
finding employment quickly could influence both decisions about college attendance, and, for reasons analogous to
those in Deaton (1991), whether the person wishes to borrow money during college. Nonetheless, the focus in this
paper on (binding) constraints that are present during college is natural since these types of constraints receive almost
exclusive attention from policymakers concerned with higher education.

                                                           1
        This paper differentiates itself from previous work by taking a direct approach for providing

evidence about this issue. Motivated by work such as Manski (1992), which finds that the well-known

differences in college completion rates by family income can largely be attributed to differences in college

drop-out rates by family income, we study the college drop-out decision of students from low income

families. We provide evidence about the importance of credit constraints by examining how much college

attrition would remain even if credit constraints were removed; our question of interest can be formulated as

follows: “how important are factors other than credit constraints in determining the substantial drop-out rates

of students from low income families?” More specifically, we provide evidence about whether substantial

attrition would remain for low income students under perhaps the most generous policy that might

conceivably be considered by policymakers to address credit constraints - one in which all direct costs are

removed and students are given access to loans that can be used to finance additional consumption during

school. Note that, for ease of exposition, in the remainder of the paper we often use phrases such as “the

amount of attrition that is unrelated to credit constraints” when it would be more precise to use “the amount

of attrition that would be present if direct costs were removed and students were given access to loans to

finance additional consumption during school.”

        Our ability to provide direct evidence about this issue is made possible by our examination of the

drop-out decision at Berea College. Berea College is located in central Kentucky and operates under a

mission (providing opportunities to students of “great promise but limited economic resources”) that leads

to the admission of students from low income backgrounds that are of specific concern to policymakers

interested in understanding the impact of liquidity constraints in higher education.

        Our approach takes advantage of both a unique institutional detail at the school and detailed

longitudinal data that we have collected specifically for the purpose of understanding the drop-out decision.

With respect to the former, the school is unique in that direct costs for students are approximately zero (and

perhaps negative) due to the presence of a full tuition subsidy (and large room and board subsidies) for all

matriculating students. Given this institutional detail, the finding in Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2003a)




                                                      2
that approximately fifty percent of matriculating students fail to graduate (and few transfer) strongly suggests

that factors other than direct costs are very important in determining the drop-out decision.

        With respect to the latter, the data come from the Berea Panel Study (BPS). This paper takes

particular advantage of two specific features that are unique to these data. First, the BPS contains a financial

module that, among other uses, allows us to identify which students would like to borrow money to increase

consumption while in school (and also are not able to borrow from other sources), and, therefore, satisfy a

theoretically appealing definition of being credit constrained. This information is used to generate a lower

bound on the percentage of the substantial amount of attrition at Berea that would remain even if students

were given access to loans that allowed them to purchase additional consumption during school and even

though direct costs are zero. This bound leads to the conclusion that the large majority of attrition would

remain even under very generous policies aimed at relaxing credit constraints. Second, because we designed

this longitudinal survey with an explicit theoretical model of the drop-out decision in mind, the data provide

substantial detail about whether students who are constrained differ from students who are unconstrained in

other ways that would influence the drop-out decision directly. This allows us to examine whether we can

credibly move away from the bound and estimate the percentage of attrition that would remain if loans were

made available to allow students to increase consumption.

        In Section II we discuss a simple theoretical model of the drop-out decision that guided much of our

data collection in the BPS and guides much our empirical work in this paper. In Section III we describe the

BPS and present a descriptive view of students at Berea. Our main empirical work takes place in Section

IV. Section V contains our conclusion that, although credit constraints likely play an important causal role

in the drop-out decisions of some students at Berea, the large majority of attrition at Berea would remain even

under very generous policies aimed at addressing credit constraints.

II. A simple theoretical model

        Let I(t0) be an indicator variable that is equal to one if the student decides at the time he completes

high school, t0, that he will not attend college. Then, defining Et0(VS) to be the expected present value of




                                                       3
lifetime utility at time t0 of entering college and Et0(VN) to be the expected present value at time t0 of not

entering college,

        (1) I(t0) =1 iff I*(t0)=Et0(VN)-Et0(VS)>0.

        A person’s total lifetime financial resources play a central role in determining lifetime utility. For

students from low income backgrounds, these resources will be determined primarily by lifetime earnings

while in the workforce. Individuals who enter the workforce without a college degree work in unskilled jobs.

Earnings in these jobs depend on a person’s unskilled human capital which are likely to be largely determined

and known at the time of the college entrance decision. Individuals who enter the workforce with a college

degree work in skilled jobs. Earnings in these jobs depend on a person’s skilled human capital which is

accumulated during college. Skilled human capital is accumulated more efficiently by individuals of high

academic ability, and, as a result, is likely related to college grade performance. Hereafter, we refer to

academic ability simply as ability.

        Unconstrained students allocate lifetime financial resources across periods in a standard manner that

depends on, for example, the person’s discount factor, intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and risk

aversion. However, the credit constrained student is faced with the additional reality that he cannot borrow

against future earnings so that during school he must rely on his personal savings at the time of college

entrance, contributions from parents during school, and labor income during school to purchase consumption

and pay the net direct costs of schooling. The reality that a constrained person would like to borrow to

increase his consumption during school implies that his lifetime consumption path will not be “smooth

enough” in the sense that the marginal utility of consumption during school is higher than the discounted

marginal utility of consumption during his working years. In this case, some constrained individuals do not

enter college even though they would enter if they were not constrained.

        Given particular levels of consumption, how happy a person will be in school relative to being out

of school will depend, in part, on the types of general preference parameters mentioned above which

influence the curvature of the utility function in consumption. However, it also seems likely that there exist

large amounts of heterogeneity in how much individuals will enjoy being in school relative to being out of


                                                      4
school that are largely unrelated to the amount of consumption a person can afford per se. For example, some

students may be particularly gifted at forming new relationships, have a particular taste/distaste for campus

living arrangements, or have a particular attachment to their hometowns.

        Given the sample of college attendees used in this paper, there is no variation in I(t0) in our data.

Thus, our work examines the effect of credit constraints on the drop-out decision. Defining I(t1) to be an

indicator variable that is equal to one if the student decides at the time he finishes his first year of college,

t1, that he will not return for his second year of college, the drop-out decision can be written analogously to

equation (1),

        (2) I(t1) =1 iff I*(t1)=Et1(VN)-Et1(VS)>0

where Et1(VS) is the expected present value of lifetime utility at time t1 of returning to college and Et1(VN)

is the expected present value of lifetime utility at time t1 of entering the workforce.

         Differences between the expectations in equation (2) and the expectations in equation (1) primarily

reflect learning that has taken place since a student enters school (Manski (1989), Altonji (1993), Carneiro

et al. (2005), Cunha et al. (2005)). Credit constraints can have a causal effect on the drop-out decision if, after

matriculation, individuals learn about their constraint status (e.g., because they learn about unexpected fees,

textbooks costs, or other components of the net direct costs of schooling) or the effect that being constrained

has on how enjoyable it is to be in school. However, it is important to note that credit constraints can also

have a causal effect on the drop-out decision even if no uncertainty exists about credit constraints at the time

of college entrance. This would be the case if being constrained causes an individual to be closer to the

margin of indifference at the time of entrance so that he is more likely to leave school when he learns about

other factors, such as ability, that influence VS and VN. This establishes a very direct connection between the

effect of credit constraints on the college drop-out decision studied here and the effect of credit constraints

on the college entrance decision which has received much of the previous attention in the literature. This

relationship is examined in more detail in an earlier version of this paper (S&S, 2005).

        Equation (2) suggests that a probit, or, alternatively, a linear probability model, which includes a

person’s constraint status as an explanatory variable is a natural choice for providing evidence about whether


                                                        5
being credit constrained influences the drop-out decision. However, such a specification will only be useful

if it is also possible to take into account potential non-financial differences between constrained and

unconstrained students. Our data are well-suited for this task because, as discussed in much more detail later,

they have been collected specifically with the goal of providing detailed information about the factors

described above that theory suggests could influence the expected values of VN and VS.

III. An overview of the Berea Panel Study and a descriptive view of students at Berea

         The BPS consists of two cohorts. Baseline surveys were administered to the first cohort (the 2000

cohort) immediately before it began its freshman year in the fall of 2000 and baseline surveys were

administered to the second cohort (the 2001 cohort) immediately before it began its freshman year in the fall

of 2001.    In addition to collecting detailed background information about students and their families, the

baseline surveys were designed to take advantage of recent advances in survey methodology (see e.g., Barsky

et al., 1997, Dominitz, 1998, and Dominitz and Manski, 1996 and 1997) in order to collect information about

students’ preferences and expectations towards uncertain future events and outcomes (e.g., academic

performance, labor market outcomes, non-pecuniary benefits of school, marriage and children) that could

influence decisions. Substantial follow-up surveys that were administered at the beginning and end of each

subsequent semester were designed to document the experiences of students and how the various factors that

might influence decisions change over time. Shorter surveys that were administered at multiple times each

year were designed to provide information about how students were using their time. Student identifiers allow

survey data to be merged with detailed administrative data, including information from the Free Application

for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA))

         The financial module was administered for the first time during the 2001-2002 academic year, after

undergoing pre-testing by students from non-BPS cohorts at Berea.2 Thus, while the 2001 cohort answered

the financial questions during their first year at Berea, the 2000 cohort did not answer these questions until



2
 Our survey design involved having students return completed surveys to us in person. This allowed us to ensure that
each student had completed each survey conscientiously and to debrief students regarding any difficulties that they may
have had understanding survey questions. We found no evidence that students had difficulty understanding any
questions on the financial module.

                                                          6
their second year at Berea. Given our specific interest in college attrition and the reality that much attrition

takes place during the first year, we concentrate here on the 2001 cohort.

        The 2001 cohort was surveyed ten times during its first year with six of these surveys being shorter

time-use surveys. The total amount of compensation received by a student who answered all surveys in his

freshman year was $133.      The financial module, which is shown in Appendix A.1, appeared on the sixth

survey of the year which was collected at the beginning of the second semester. As a result, we focus on

individuals who returned for the second semester, and, therefore, answered the financial questions while still

enrolled at Berea. The 2001 cohort had a response rate on the baseline survey of .87 with 375 out of the 433

entering students at Berea participating. Participation on the baseline was a necessary condition for further

participation while at Berea. We concentrate on domestic students and exclude the 21 foreign students.

Twenty-seven of the remaining students (.076) left school before the beginning of the second semester. This

leaves 327 students who were eligible to complete the sixth survey. Our sample consists of the 307 eligible

students (.939) who completed this survey.

        Some basic demographics of this sample are shown in the first column of Table 1. Forty-four percent

of students are male and 19% of students are black. As expected given the mission of Berea, students at the

school are quite poor with an average family income of $26,510. Although not shown in Table 1, the first

quartile, median, and third quartile are $12,500, $27,000, and $39,500 respectively. In addition to having low

income, students’ families have little wealth. On average, a student’s family has total cash, savings, and

checking account balances of $1241 and total investments (excluding the family residence) of $1855.

Roughly half of the students do not have at least one parent that graduated from college.

        From the standpoint of thinking about whether the types of non-financial factors that influence

students at Berea also tend to influence students elsewhere, it seems particularly useful to think about college

entrance exams, which past work has found to be perhaps the strongest predictor of college performance. The

average score on the American College Test (ACT) is 23.2 in our sample. In earlier versions of this paper we

show that this average implies that students at Berea are at least as academically gifted as students from

similar income backgrounds who attend schools nationally or attend the flagship state universities (The


                                                       7
University of Kentucky and The University of Tennessee) in the region. This is important for our conclusions

because, if this were not true, the amount of attrition that is unrelated to constraints would be expected to be

higher at Berea than elsewhere.

         In terms of outcomes, many students do not graduate. The drop-out rate before the second year for

the individuals in our sample (who all started the second semester) is .169. Taking into account the drop-out

rate in the first semester, the overall first-year drop-out rate from Berea for the 354 domestic participants in

the BPS survey is .228.3 As discussed in detail in S&S (2003a), the drop-out rates of students at Berea are

generally similar to those of students with comparable backgrounds who attend other schools. Stinebrickner

and Stinebrickner (2003a) discuss the reality that very few students who left Berea during 1989-1997

transferred to other four year schools.

         Some information about current consumption levels is obtained by Question A.2 in Appendix A.1:

Question A.2 (partial): How much money do you expect that you will spend this year (September
2001 - August 2002) not including college related costs? $________


where Question A.1 informs student to include “expenses for things such as clothing, travel, telephone, cars,

recreation, entertainment, and food and snacks not included in the college food plan” and college related costs

are described in Question A.1 to include term bills (which include campus room and board), books, and class-

related supplies.

         While this question is undoubtedly answered with substantial error and includes both the academic

year and the summer after the first academic year, the answers leave little doubt that these low income

students spend little on consumption during college outside of academic expenses and the room and board

they pay to live on campus. The average answer to this question at the beginning of the second semester was

$957 and the median response is less than $600. This evidence is entirely consistent with what we informally

observed during survey collection when individuals regularly stressed that the survey compensation

represented an important source of consumption spending. Thus, there seems to be substantial scope for


3
 The overall first-year drop-out rate for non-participants in the BPS is .293. However, given the small number of non-
participants, a test of the null that the drop-out rate is the same for participants and non-participants is not rejected at
traditional significance levels (p-value=.286).

                                                             8
short-term constraints to operate. In the remainder of the paper we examine whether there is evidence that

this is indeed the case.

IV. An analysis of the importance of factors unrelated to credit constraints

IV.1. Are students at Berea credit-constrained?

         We identify student i as being credit-constrained and set the dummy variable CONSTRAINEDi equal

to one if he/she answers in the affirmative to the first part of Question E.1 from the financial module:

Question E.1 Suppose that someone offered to loan you money this year so that you could increase the
amount of money that you would have for spending money during this year. Suppose that the loan is made
at a fair interest rate and that you would not have to begin repaying the loan until after you leave Berea.
Would you accept the loan? YES              NO

Question E.2 If you answered YES,
             You would like to borrow money to increase your spending at Berea during this year.
             Remember, you will have to pay back the loan and any interest after leaving Berea. How
             much money would you choose to borrow this year in order to increase your spending money
             this year?
             $ ______________.

          Despite our Section III finding that students at Berea have very little spending money, only 62 of

307 (.202) students in our sample are identified as being credit constrained using this criteria.4 In absolute

terms, constrained students do not wish to borrow particularly large amounts of money; the average

constrained person indicates that he would like to borrow only $889 for the current academic year and the

median amount is only $500. At the same time, it seems quite possible that the loans might make a

substantial difference to constrained students since these amounts are only slightly smaller than the total

expected spending amounts for the year from Question A.2 above.

Financial resources by constraint status

          Some confidence in the responses to the survey question can be obtained indirectly by examining

whether constrained students differ from unconstrained students in ways that might be generally consistent

with the presence of a constraint. As shown in the Additional Financial Variables section of Table 1, we



4
 Although designed independently, this question is similar in spirit to a question that is included in the 1995 Canadian
Out of Employment Panel and is examined by Crossley and Low (2004). They find that 19% of primary wage earners
are constrained three quarters of a year after a job loss.


                                                           9
find that, while neither constrained or unconstrained students are particularly wealthy, constrained students

have remarkably few resources that could be used for consumption in the second semester. Perhaps most

noteworthy, constrained students report having, on average, personal savings of only $246 and the median

constrained student has less than $50 in savings at the beginning of the second semester. In contrast,

unconstrained students report having, on average, savings of $940 and the median unconstrained student has

approximately $300 in savings.         The null hypothesis that the average savings of constrained and

unconstrained individuals is identical is rejected at all traditional levels of significance with a t-statistic of

5.405. Interestingly, the average difference in savings between constrained and unconstrained students is

similar to the average amount that constrained students wish to borrow.

         The last five entries of the Additional Financial Variables section of Table 1 show results from

Question B.2 of the financial module which asks students about possible sources that could be used to

increase consumption. Consistent with the findings above related to savings, unconstrained individuals in

the sample are roughly five times as likely as constrained individuals to report that they could use personal

savings to increase consumption above what they currently are planning to spend during the year.

Constrained students, who receive slightly less money from their parents, are only half as likely to report that

they could increase spending through grants from parents, friends, or relatives (.14 vs. .27). Neither

constrained or unconstrained students tend to believe that they could increase consumption by borrowing

money from either family or formal sources. The last financial entry in Table 1 indicates that constrained

students are only half as likely to report that they could increase spending through any source (.21 versus .41).

         Evidence of financial differences also appear on the Free Application for Student Financial Aid

(FAFSA). For example, the first entry in the financial section of Table 1 shows that the average savings of

parents of constrained students in our sample is smaller than the average savings of parents of unconstrained

students in our sample by a factor of 3.7, and this difference is statistically significant at a 5% level.

Some additional issues related to using Question E.1 to identify constrained students

         With respect to our definition of being constrained, there are several other things to note. First, an

ideal definition of being constrained may be that a person wants to borrow and has no other resources that


                                                       10
will allow him to do so. In practice, this is very close to the definition we use since, as just discussed, only

21% of constrained individuals say that they have any financial resources that could be used to increase

consumption and it seems reasonable to believe that some of these 21% would not be able to increase

consumption as much as they would like using these sources. Regardless, the main conclusions of the paper

become even stronger and other results change very little if the 21% are excluded from the constrained group.

          Second, because we do not explicitly specify an interest rate in Question E.1, it is natural to imagine

that students may have in mind a “fair” interest rate that is lower than what might be “reasonable” to actually

receive. Similarly, the answers to our survey questions might not exactly mirror what would happen if a loan

was actually made available if students tend to have a mentality that “of course I want more money” and do

not fully internalize certain costs (e.g., time costs of applying or future consumption costs of borrowing) that

would likely become quite apparent during the application process. However, these kinds of reporting errors

would seem to imply that, if anything, we would tend to overstate the amount of students that would accept

a loan if it was actually offered, and this is not problematic given that it would imply that our bound in

Section IV.2 is even more conservative.

          Third, it is not clear whether a non-trivial number of students are dropping out because they are not

able to borrow money to help parents or family members. If there are such people and these people would

not answer in the affirmative to our constraint question, our results pertain to the amount of attrition that

would remain under a policy in which all direct costs are removed and students are offered loans that allow

them to increase their own consumption during school. If there are not such people or these people would

answer in the affirmative to our constraint question, then our results pertain to an even more generous policy

in which students can also borrow money to help finance the consumption of parents. What is important is

that, in either case, the lower bound described below is a lower bound for the former (less generous) policy

which is informative because this policy is arguably the most extensive policy that might currently be given

serious attention by policymakers.5 Further, we have two ways of providing some information that this issue

5
 While required participation in the work-study program at Berea described in S&S(2003b) might imply that the
situation being studied is not quite the most generous policy that could be imagined, a couple of institutional details
might mitigate concerns about the costs of working. First, work hours in the first year are tightly regulated with little
variation around the required ten hours of work per week. Second, the fact that jobs are on-campus may alleviate certain

                                                          11
may not be overly important. First, to the extent that this issue is likely to be of particular relevance for

students whose parents lose jobs, it is informative that a parental job loss question in Appendix A.2 indicates

that only 6.6% of the drop-outs in our sample and 6.1% of the non-drop-outs in our sample have either a

mother or father that “lost a job without being able to find a similarly paying replacement job” between the

beginning of the academic year and the end of the academic year. Second, as described in Section IV.4, data

from an exit-reason module indicate that few people are leaving school for financial concerns related to their

families.

IV.2 The proportion of attrition at Berea due to factors other than credit constraints

            The outcome we examine is whether students who start the second semester drop out before the start

of the second year. The proportion of the attrition at Berea that should be attributed to credit constraints is

found by dividing the proportion of all students at Berea who drop out because they are constrained by the

proportion of all students who drop out for any reason. Our parameter of interest, the proportion of the

attrition that is unrelated to credit constraints, P, is one minus this ratio and can be written as


                   p1p2
 (3)        P'1&          ,
                   p3
where p1 is the proportion of students that are constrained, p2 is the increase in the drop-out probability of

constrained students that is caused by the constraint, and p3 is the proportion of all students who drop out for

any reason.

            A primary contribution of this paper is that our survey efforts described in Section IV.1 allow us

to provide an estimate, .202, for p1. From the first row of Table 1, we obtain an estimate of .169 for p3.

Given the availability of these estimates, the remaining difficulty is that p2 is not observed. We begin by

constructing an upper bound for p2 which implies a lower bound for P. We then discuss whether we might

be able to credibly estimate p2 , and, hence, P, using additional information from the BPS.




typical costs (e.g., fixed travel costs) of working. Finally, the fact that all students must work may imply that the work
policy does not have a large effect on relative (or possibly absolute) grades. In addition, the work-study program
undoubtedly has generous aspects in that many jobs allow students to gain human capital that is marketable in the
workplace, although this may be particularly true for types of jobs held by upper year students.

                                                           12
         The upper bound for p2, .274, is found by making the conservative assumption that all of the

attrition of constrained students shown in the first row of Table 1 is caused by constraints. From equation

(3), we then obtain an upper bound on the proportion of attrition at Berea that should be attributed to

constraints of .327 (Row 1, Column 4 of Table 2) so that our lower bound on P indicates that at least 67%

of all attrition at Berea is caused by factors unrelated to short-term liquidity constraints (Row 1, Column 5

of Table 2) . Thus, even under the extreme assumption that all of the attrition of constrained individuals

should be attributed to credit constraints, our bound is informative in the sense that it indicates that the large

majority of attrition at Berea is due to factors unrelated to short-term constraints during college.

         This bound is likely to be quite conservative because some constrained students who drop out

undoubtedly do so for reasons other than credit constraints. As a result, it seems worthwhile to examine

whether it is possible to compute a credible estimate of p2. The simplest possibility is to estimate p2 using

a linear probability model of the form

(4) I(t1)i =α + p2 CONSTRAINEDi + ui

where the unobservable u captures all of the non-constraint factors discussed in Section II that influence the

drop-out decision. As shown in Column 1 of Table 3, the estimate of p2 from this specification is .131.

         As shown in Row 2 of Table 2, using this estimate in equation (3) results in an estimate of P which

implies that 84% of attrition should be attributed to factors unrelated to credit constraints. While this

conclusion relies on an assumption that constrained and unconstrained students are identical in all dimensions

that are unrelated to the constraint, the result is also informative if CONSTRAINED is negatively correlated

with u since, in this case, the estimate of p2 would continue to represent an upper bound on the true value.

Consistent with a non-positive correlation between CONSTRAINED and u is the general notion that students

with less personal and family wealth generally also suffer from other disadvantages such as inferior academic

ability/preparation. However, it is worth noting that selection issues related to the college entrance decision

could, in isolation, generate a positive correlation. For example, if all students who entered Berea were at

the margin of indifference between entering and not entering college, then, by definition, students who knew




                                                       13
that they were constrained at the time of entrance would have other advantages that positively influence the

drop-out probability.

          In reality, the school is selective in its admissions, and, in addition, the importance of the selection

issue would be mitigated if many constrained students do not anticipate the constraint at the time of entrance,

a possibility suggested in Section IV.3 and by recent data collection at the time of entrance.6           Regardless,

because we cannot guarantee that CONSTRAINED has a non-positive correlation with u, it seems worthwhile

to treat the question of whether substantial non-constraint differences exist between constrained and

unconstrained individuals as an empirical issue. Roughly speaking, our theoretical discussion in Section II

suggests that, in addition to being potentially influenced by credit constraints, the drop-out decision is

determined by 1) ability, 2) beliefs about earnings conditional on particular levels of completion and

academic performance, and 3) preferences which indicate how much utility a person would receive over his

lifetime given particular schooling and earnings paths. The detailed data in the BPS allow us to directly

examine each of these dimensions. In Appendix B we describe the information that we collected in detail.

We find that constrained and unconstrained individuals are very similar in non-financial respects; while seven

out of fourteen variables related to a student’s financial situation at the time of entrance are found in Table

1 to vary in a statistically significant way by constraint status, only one of thirty-nine variables related to the

three non-constraint factors above is found in Appendix B to vary by constraint status.

          A more formal approach is taken in Table 3 by adding covariates to equation (4). The variables that

we utilize in Table 3 are defined in Table 1 and described in detail in Appendix B. In Column 2 of Table 3

we add the set of Traditional variables in Table 1 to the specification in Column 1 of Table 3. In Column

3 of Table 3 we augment the specification in Column 2 of Table 3 by adding a variety of Additional variables

related to ability and motivation at the time of college entrance shown in Table 1. In Column 4 we augment

the specification in Column 2 by adding the variable in Table 1 that describes a student’s Belief about

6
 While we cannot examine whether the students in our sample anticipated being constrained at the time of entrance, we
recently examined beliefs about constraint status at the time of entrance for a new cohort of Berea students. We found
that the proportion of people in our new sample who anticipated being constrained at the time of entrance was even
smaller (55/308=.176) than the proportion of individuals who were constrained in our sample. Thus, if at the time of
entrance some students make type II errors related to their constraint status, then a non-trivial number of constrained
students in our current sample likely did not anticipate the constraint.

                                                         14
financial return to schooling at time of college entrance. In Column 5 we augment the specification in

Column 2 by adding the Table 1 Variables related to preferences at time of college entrance.7 In Column

6 we include all variables that appear in the specifications in Columns 1-5. We find that adding variables

leads to an increase in the value of R2 , but that, as expected given the evidence from the previous paragraph,

the estimate of p2 changes relatively little across specifications. The estimates of P obtained by using the

estimates of p2 from Columns 2-6 of Table 3 in equation (3) are shown in Rows 3-7 of Table 2 and range from

.853 to .872. Thus, the additional results continue to suggest strongly that the majority of attrition at Berea

should be attributed to reasons that are unrelated to credit constraints. Further, the fact that the estimate of

P increases slightly as more variables are added suggests that, if one was willing to make the strong

“observables are like unobservables” assumption in the general spirit of Altonji et al. (2005), the results

would, if anything, be strengthened slightly further.

IV.3 The effect of the constraint on constrained students

          The finding that attrition should be attributed primarily to reasons other than credit constraints arises

primarily because relatively few students are constrained. Indeed, the evidence from Table 3 suggests that

credit constraints may have a non-trivial effect on the relatively small number of people who are constrained;

the CONSTRAINED variable is significant and quantitatively important in all columns of Table 3 and the

estimates indicate that between 40% and 48% of the drop-out rate of constrained students should be attributed

to the constraint.

          It is worthwhile to provide some additional evidence in support of this possibility that credit

constraints play an important causal role in the decisions of some students. The effect of liquidity constraints

should operate most directly through how much a person enjoys school.                       The Table 1 variables

Sch_enjoyable and Sch_unenjoyable, which were constructed from question 1.A. in Appendix B.3.c, indicate

that beliefs about how enjoyable school will be relative to being out of school are very similar by constraint

status at the time of entrance. This finding is consistent with a situation in which students do not tend to

7
 Information about the discount factor and intertemporal elasticity of substitution are not included in the regressions
because, as discussed in Appendix B, for a non-trivial of students we could not ascertain values of these variables.
However, using all available observations, Appendix B finds no differences in these variables between constrained and
unconstrained students.

                                                         15
anticipate their constraint status (or the effect of the constraint) at the time of entrance and constrained and

unconstrained students are indeed similar in non-financial ways that influence the drop-out decision.

However, if constraints are having a causal effect on exits, differences should be revealed after the time of

college entrance, and we find some evidence that this is the case. At the end of the first semester, .561 of

unconstrained individuals but only .387 of constrained indicate that being in school is much more enjoyable

than not being in school. A test of the null hypothesis that the difference in the population proportions is

zero has a t-statistic of 2.25. Similarly, .075 of unconstrained students and .184 of constrained students

indicate that being in school is less enjoyable than not being in school, and a test of the null hypothesis that

the difference in the population proportions is zero has a t-statistic of 1.88. The results at the end of the year

are virtually identical.8 Related to this, although we find that both constrained and unconstrained students

are in very good health at the beginning of the year, we find differences at the middle and end of the year.9

    Given that individuals of college age are unlikely to suffer major medical problems in a year conditional on

being in good health at the beginning of the year, it seems likely that the health problems reported by the

constrained students at the middle and end of the year may be of the nature that could be caused by problems

such as stress that would potentially be related to how enjoyable school is in general and worries about

financial problems in particular.

IV.4 Why do so few students want to borrow?

            An open question is why 80% of students do not wish to borrow money given the low levels of

consumption found in Section III. If students are unhappy with their consumption profiles but do not wish

to borrow for, say, reasons related to religious beliefs, then certain alternative policies (e.g., offering subsidies



8
 The proportions for the “much more enjoyable” category are .363 (constrained) and .541 (unconstrained) with a t-
statistic of 2.22. The proportions for the “less enjoyable” category are .182 (constrained) and .077 (constrained) with
a t-statistic of 1.72.
9
 At the beginning of the year, .901 of constrained and .941 of unconstrained students report being in good or excellent
health. At the end of the first semester, .873 of unconstrained but only .720 of constrained individuals report being in
good or excellent health. At the end of the academic year, .884 of unconstrained and .750 of constrained individuals
report being in good or excellent health. A test that the population proportions of constrained and unconstrained
individuals that are in good or excellent health is not rejected at traditional significance levels in the first case, is rejected
at significance levels of greater than .007 in the second case, and is rejected at significance levels greater than .019 in
the last case.

                                                               16
to increase consumption) may have a substantial effect even if the type of loan policy studied here does not.

We are able to provide some information about this issue using Question E.3 (Appendix A.1). We find that

the majority of individuals are happy with their current consumption amounts. Sixty-four percent of

unconstrained students answer that they do not want to borrow money because they are “happy with the

amount I am currently spending and would not choose to increase spending now because I would have less

to spend later when I had to repay the loan and interest .” Further, many of the remaining answers to this

question that fall into an open ended “other” category can also loosely be interpreted in this way. Thus, our

findings suggest that, even in an entirely unconstrained world, individuals would choose to spend

substantially less money during school than they would after leaving school. One possible explanation for

this result is that the college environment may be one where many services and recreational activities are

either provided by schools or are of a low cost nature and where it may be acceptable to go without

consumption goods, such as televisions and cars, that might be deemed necessary or more important later.

IV.5 Some additional evidence from an exit module

          The theory in Section II suggests that, in order to provide evidence about the percentage of attrition

that would remain even if access to credit was made available, it is necessary to consider two avenues through

which credit constraints can have a causal effect on the drop-out decision. First, credit constraints can have

a causal effect if, after matriculation, an individual learns that he/she is constrained or learns that a constraint

will make it less enjoyable to be in school than expected. Second, even if no learning about credit constraints

takes place after college entrance, constraints can have a causal effect if a person knows at the time of college

entrance that school will be less enjoyable than it would otherwise be due to the presence of a constraint.

          We can provide evidence about the former using an exit-reason module which is shown in Appendix

A.3 and was sent to all drop-outs from the 2001 cohort soon after they left Berea. We focus on individuals

who left Berea before the start of their third year. The total drop-out rate before the third year was 31% for

our sample of 354 domestic students with 109 of 354 students leaving. Our sample used for the exit-reason

analysis includes the 76 (71%) of the drop-outs who responded to the exit survey and had usable information

on all questions need for our analysis.


                                                        17
         Motivated by a learning model of decision-making, Question G (Appendix A.3) lists an exhaustive

set of 14 possible reasons (including an “other” category) that students could have learned after college

entrance that school was less beneficial or less enjoyable than expected at the time of college entrance. Two

closely related reasons in the exit module (g and h) involve situations where a student has learned that school

is less enjoyable for reasons related to his own financial situation:

 g. Worries about my own personal financial situation made school less enjoyable than expected

 h. Concerns about not having enough money for items that would make my life more pleasant (for example,
 a car, entertainment, dates, and social activities) have made school less enjoyable than expected.

         We find that 57% of drop-outs found reason g to be true, 53% of drop-outs found reason h to be

true, and 67% percent of drop-outs found either reason g to be true or reason h to be true. We find that 25%

of drop-outs found reason g to be very important, 12% of drop-outs found reason h to be very important, and

28% percent found either reason g or reason h to be very important. However, because the average drop-out

indicates that many reasons are true and many reasons are very important, these results do not directly answer

the question of interest - what percentage of the drop-outs would have left school even they had not found

that g and h were true? One way to provide evidence about this question is to use an additional component

of the survey question which appears as Question H (Appendix A.3) For each person, Question H elicits a

set R={R1,...,RN} where Ri is the reason that the person believes was the ith most important in pushing him

over the margin of indifference and out of school, R is a set of reasons that would have been sufficient to push

the person over the margin and out of school, and the set {R1,...,RN-1} would not be sufficient to push the

person over the margin and out of school.

         This question is useful because it implies that, if reasons g and h are each not included in R, then

the person would have left school even if he had not learned that g or h were true. We find that most

individuals indicate that a small number of reasons would have been sufficient for them to leave school and




                                                      18
these reasons typically do not include g or h.10 Our results indicate that at most 8% of the attrition arose

because people learned about constraints after arriving at school.

          In Section IV.1 we noted that it was not clear whether our conclusions take into account the

possibility that some students drop out because they are not able to borrow money to help parents or family

members. Reason f in our exit module pertains directly to that possibility:

 f. Worries about financial problems related to my family made school less enjoyable than expected.

When we examine whether f, g, or h are elements of R, we find very little change in our results.              The new

results imply that at most 9% of the attrition arose because people learned about constraints after arriving

at school. Of relevance for the interpretation of the results in Section IV, the results suggest that concerns

about the financial situation of families do not tend to be a primary driving force in attrition.

          In an earlier footnote we mentioned that only 18% of a recent cohort of students anticipated, at the

time of entrance, that they would be constrained during college. When combined, our finding that the large

majority of students do not anticipate being constrained at entrance and our finding that little drop-out is

caused by students learning that they are constrained during college are consistent with the notion that the

large majority of attrition should be attributed to factors other than constraints.

V. Conclusion

        Our results suggest that there exists a group of students at Berea whose outcomes are likely to suffer

because their ability to purchase consumption during school is constrained. Further, because constrained

students do not wish to borrow much in absolute terms, the results suggest that a policy to help these students

would not be particularly expensive. Nonetheless, the results here suggest that the large majority of attrition

would remain under the generous policy in which direct costs are zero and students are given access to loans

which could be used to purchase additional consumption during college. Further research is needed to

provide a comprehensive view of how students from low income families decide whether to remain in school.


10
  Fifty-six of the 76 students indicate that a single reason was important enough that it would have been sufficient for
them to leave school (N=1). Of these students, only three indicate that this reason was either g or h. Eleven students
indicate that their two most important reasons would have been sufficient for them to leave school (N=2). Of these
students, only one indicates that either g or h was one of these two reasons. The remaining nine students have N=3 or
N=4. Three of these students list either g or h in R.

As described after equation (3),
p̂1 is an estimate of the proportion of students that are constrained
p̂2 is an upper bound (row 1) or an estimate (rows 2-7) of the increase in the drop-out probability of constrained students
that is caused by the constraint.
p̂3 is an estimate of the proportion of all students that drops out for any reason.
The fourth column shows an upper bound (row 1) or an estimate (rows 2-7) of the proportion of the attrition that is due to
credit constraints.
The fifth column shows a lower bound (row 1) or an estimate (rows 2-7) of P, the proportion of the attrition that is unrelated
to credit constraints.
Sample sizes vary across rows depending on how many observations were available to estimate corresponding models in
Table 3. See note in Table 3.
Standard errors in Columns 4 and 5 are computed using bootstrap techniques.

                                             Appendix A Survey questions

Appendix A.1. Financial Module from Survey 6

Question A. We are interested in how much spending money you have compared to what you thought you would have
when you arrived at Berea.

A.1 When you arrived at Berea in September, approximately how much money did you expect that you would spend
during the next year (September 2001-August 2002) not including college related costs (term bills, books, class-related
supplies)? Please include expenses for things such as clothing, travel, telephone, cars, recreation, entertainment, and
food and snacks not included in the college food plan. $______________________

A.2 You may have found out that you would like to spend more or less spending money than you expected when you
arrived at Berea. You may also have found out that the amount of spending money that you have available after paying
for college costs is more or less than you expected when you arrived. How much money do you now expect that you
will spend this year (September 2001-August 2002) not including college related costs?
$_________________________


Question B. After taking into account what you need to pay your term bill and other college costs in the future, do you
have savings or other financial resources that would allow you to increase the amount of spending money that you have
during the current academic year beyond the amount you have written in Question A?

B.1        YES (could increase spending if wanted)   NO (cannot increase spending)

B.2. If you circled YES, please check any of the following ways that you could increase your spending money at the
present time if you decided that you wanted to.

      1.    I have personal savings that I could use to increase spending money _____________
      2.    Parents, friends, or relatives would be able and willing to give me more spending money _____________
      3.    Parents, friends, or relatives would be able and willing to loan me money _______
      4.    I am able to borrow money from other sources at fair interest rates ________

Question C. How much savings do you personally have? Include money in savings accounts, checking accounts, or
other investments. $___________________

Question D. Do you have one or more credit cards? YES             NO

            If YES, how much money do you owe on your credit cards? Please include any current balances that you will
            not pay off this month. $___________________

Question E. Suppose that someone offered to loan you money this year so that you could increase the amount of money
that you would have for spending money during this year. Suppose that the loan is made at a fair interest rate and that
you would not have to begin repaying the loan until after you leave Berea.
E.1 Would you accept the loan? YES           NO

E.2         If you answered YES,
            You would like to borrow money to increase your spending at Berea during this year. Remember, you will have
            to pay back the loan and any interest after leaving Berea. How much money would you choose to borrow this
            year in order to increase your spending money this year? $ ______________

E.3        If you answered NO,
      Why would you not accept the loan?
       1. I am happy with the amount I am currently spending and would not choose to increase spending now since I

Appendix B. Details of other sources of heterogeneity between constrained and unconstrained students
          In the next three subsections (B.1, B.2, B.3) we examine whether differences exist by constraint status in
1) ability, 2) beliefs about earnings conditional on particular levels of completion and academic performance, and
3) preferences which indicate how much utility a person would receive over his lifetime given particular schooling
and earnings paths. The implicit assumption is that the variables being compared are not influenced by the constraint.
B.1. Differences in academic ability by constraint status
        Given previous evidence that a student’s cumulative grade point average is often the strongest predictor of
whether a person stays in school (S&S, 2003a), it seems particularly important to pay careful attention to whether
differences exist in determinants of college grade point average such as ability and motivation.
 In Columns 1 and 2 of Table Suppl.1 we regress a student’s first semester college grade point average on ACT and
HSGPA, respectively.         The coefficients (tstats) are .065 (5.338) and .736 (7.854) respectively in the two
specifications and these two variables explain .082 and .172 of the variation in college GPA respectively when
included separately. Although not shown in the table, the two variables explain .193 of the variation when included
in a specification together.
          We have used the BPS to collect a variety of additional information at the time of college entrance that helps
to characterize a person’s academic ability, motivation, and beliefs about the importance of college. For example,
with respect to academic ability at the time of college entrance, the BPS asks a student what grade point average he
would expect to receive conditional on particular amounts of study time during college. The answer conditional on
studying three hours a day determines the GPA_study3 variable in Table 1. With respect to questions of motivation
and work ethic, the BPS asks a student how many hours he spent studying per week in high school (StudyHS) and
how many hours he plans to spend studying per day in college (StudyC). With respect to questions that combine
motivation and work effort with ability, the BPS includes the following two questions which, respectively, ask an
individual to express his beliefs about the probability that his grade point average in the first semester will fall into
each of a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive intervals and asks an individual about the probability
that he will be suspended from school at some point because of poor grade performance.
We realize that you do not know exactly how well you will do in classes. However, we would like to have you describe your
beliefs about the grade point average that you expect to receive in the first semester. Given the amount of study-time you
indicated in question H, please tell us the percent chance that your grade point average will be in each of the following intervals.
That is, for each interval, write the number of chances out of 100 that your final grade point average will be in that interval.
Note: The numbers on the six lines must add up to 100.
Interval            Percent Chance (number of chances out of 100).

[3.5, 4.00]                          ____________
[3.0, 3.49]                          ____________
[2.5, 2.99]                           ____________
[2.0, 2.49]                           ____________
[1.0, 1.99]                           ____________
[0.0, .99]                            ____________

What do you think is the percent chance (number of chances out of 100) that you will be forced to leave school (that
is, suspended by the college) in the future due to poor academic performance? _____________

The answer on the first line of the former question determines the variable Pr_GPA3.5 in Table 1. The answer
to the second question determines the variable Pr_forced_leave.

         In Columns 3-7 of Table Suppl.1 we regress first semester college grade point average on the new variables
separately and find that four of the five new variables are statistically related to grade performance. The ninth and
tenth columns show that adding these additional variables jointly increases the R2 of the linear specification by
approximately 30% over a specification which contains HSGPA and ACT as well as MALE, BLACK, PARENTED,
and FAMINC. Although not shown, adding these variables increases the R2 by approximately 50% over the
specification that contains only HSGPA and ACT. A test of the null hypothesis that the effects of the new variables
are jointly zero is rejected at significance levels greater than .019.
         Thus, the evidence suggests that we have access to a variety of traditional and non-traditional variables that
are related to ability and motivation at the time of entrance. What is important for this study is that the descriptive
statistics in Table 1 indicates no evidence of a systematic relationship between any of the new variables and a
person’s constraint status.
B.2. Differences in beliefs about earnings conditional on particular levels of completion and academic
performance by constraint status
         At the time of college entrance and at the end of the first year, we elicited beliefs about distributions of
earnings using a survey approach that follows in the general spirit of the work by Dominitz (1998), and Dominitz
and Manski (1996 , 1997). Specifically, for each of a number of schooling scenarios, we ask each individual to report
the first, second, and third quartiles associated with the future earnings he would earn at several future ages given
the scenario. Here we concentrate on answers associated with earnings at the age of 28.
         At the time of college entrance, one of the schooling scenarios involves leaving school immediately. The
first row of Table Suppl.2 shows that, on average, the median income associated with this scenario is $29,576 and
$29,626 for the constrained and unconstrained groups respectively. Although not shown, the average first quartile
and third quartile are also similar across the constrained and unconstrained groups. At the time of college entrance,
other schooling scenarios involved graduating from college (unconditional on grade performance) and graduating
with a 3.75 grade point average, a 3.0 grade point average, and a 2.0 grade point average, respectively. The latter
three scenarios provide information about the distribution of earnings conditional on ability. Rows 2-5 of Table
Suppl.2 indicate that, on average, the median earnings associated with these scenarios are also similar across
constrained and unconstrained individuals. We reach the same conclusions when we examine, in the second part of
Table Suppl.2, the answers to these questions at the end of the first academic year.
         Thus, if the answers to our questions truly reflect beliefs, the evidence suggests that constrained and
unconstrained individuals do not differ in their beliefs about the financial returns to college. Given the newness of
the types of questions being used here, it makes sense to look for evidence of whether the answers are related to the
drop-out decision. For the earnings questions that are answered at the time of college entrance, we construct two
measures of the returns to schooling.
R1=Log(Median earnings age 28 if graduate)-Log(Median earnings age 28 if leave school immediately)
R2=Log(Median earnings age 28 if graduate 3.0 GPA)-Log(Median earnings age 28 if leave immediately)
We compute the same two measures using data from the end of the school year and call these measures R3 and R4.
As expected given the previous results in Table Suppl.2, the measures R1, R2, and R4 are similar across constrained
and unconstrained individuals.11
            Column 1 of Table Suppl.3 shows the results obtained by regressing the drop-out indicator on a dummy
variable which has a value of unity if R1 is less than a median value, and, therefore indicates that a person’s beliefs
about the returns to schooling are “small.” Columns 2-4 of Table Suppl.3 are similar but include dummy variables
that are constructed using R2-R4 respectively.          We find evidence that individuals that believe that the returns to
schooling are small are significantly more likely to drop-out of school; the t-statistics associated with the dummy
variables constructed from R1-R4 are 1.40, 2.06, 2.35, and 2.30 respectively. In addition, the effects are quantitatively
large; the estimates of having beliefs that the returns to schooling are small increases the mean drop-out probability
by 44%, 75%, 122%, and 121%, respectively relative to the case where the returns to schooling are large. We use
the variable R2 as our Return_to_schooling variable in Table 1.
B.3. Differences in preferences which indicate how much utility a person would receive over his lifetime given
particular schooling and earnings paths
             In Section B.3.a we take advantage of recent innovations in survey methodology by Barsky et al. (1997)
to directly examine whether some of the basic properties associated with utility, such as risk aversion, intertemporal
elasticity of substitution, and rate of time preference, differ across constrained and unconstrained individuals.12 In
B.3.b we take an indirect approach of examining whether differences in particular personal or family situations,
which might make school less enjoyable relative to being out of the workforce at a given level of consumption, exist
between constrained and unconstrained individuals. In B.3.c we take a final, direct approach.
B.3.a. Risk aversion, intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and the discount rate
Risk Aversion
            The first general property of utility functions that we examine is risk aversion. We are able to provide some
direct evidence using a set of survey questions suggested by Barsky et al. (1997) which involve asking individuals
about hypothetical gambles involving income. At the beginning of the year, individuals were asked the following
question:
Suppose in the future you have a job which is guaranteed to give you a certain amount of income every year for life.
You are given the opportunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-50 chance it will double your income
and a 50-50 chance it will cut your income by one-third (33%). Would you take the new job? YES NO

            If the answer to the question was YES, the person was asked whether he would still accept the job if “The
chances were 50-50 that the new job would double your income, and 50-50 that it would cut it in half (50%).” If the
answer to the question was NO, the person was asked whether he would take the new job if “The chances were 50-50
that the new job would double your income, and 50-50 that it would cut it by twenty percent (20%).” Thus, each


    11
     A test of the null hypothesis that the population value of R1 is the same for constrained and unconstrained individuals
    has a pvalue of .952. p values for R2 and R4 are .807 and .292 respectively. It does not make sense to compare R3 across
    constraint status because the constraint may influence a person’s grades by influencing their effort.
    12
         We thank the authors of Barsky et al. (1997) for providing the questions that we used in the survey.
person answers two questions and the two answers separate respondents into four risk preference categories. These
categories can be ranked in order of risk aversion without making a functional form assumption for the utility
function. Bounds on the risk aversion associated with each of the categories can be obtained with a functional form
assumption. For example, if one is willing to assume a constant relative risk aversion form for the utility function,
an answer sequence of NN would imply that a person has risk aversion greater than 3.76, an answer sequence of NY
would imply that a person has risk aversion between 2.0 and 3.76, an answer sequence of YN would imply that a
person has risk aversion between 1.0 and 2.0, and an answer sequence of YY would imply that a person has risk
aversion less than 1.0.
             Table Suppl.4 indicates that individuals are quite risk averse and that constrained and unconstrained
individuals have similar levels of risk aversion. For example .60 and .63 of constrained and unconstrained
individuals respectively fall into one of the 2 most risk averse categories (risk aversion greater than 2.0 under the
CRRA assumption).
             As some evidence that these experimental questions contain some useful information, Barsky et al. (1997)
find that answers to these types of questions are related to risky activities for respondents in the Health and
Retirement Study. Unfortunately, our data do not contain information about risky activities that would be useful
for examining the explanatory power of these questions. However, we do find that sample members in the two least
risk averse classes (Risk_aversion_low) are more than 50% more likely to leave school than sample members in the
two most risk averse classes (.220 vs. .143). A test of the null hypothesis that the two population proportions are
equal is rejected at significant levels greater than .087.
Intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the discount factor
           Our survey questions eliciting time preference and intertemporal substitution were provided by the authors
of Barsky et. al (1997). As in their work, the behavioral equation motivating the design of the questions is
(B.1)         ∆log(c)=γ (r-β)
where c is consumption, r is the real interest rate, and β is the subjective discount rate. γ is the elasticity of
intertemporal substitution which can be written as
(B.2) γ=dlog(c)/dlog(1+r).
             Equation B.1 shows that a person’s consumption path depends on both γ and β. This motivates our
identification strategy which is the same as described in Barsky et. al (1997):
             “...we first posed a hypothetical set of circumstances that are meant to control for heterogeneity in economic and
             demographic conditions... Then the respondents were shown charts with different profiles of consumption with
             constant present value at a zero interest rate and were asked to choose the preferred path. In subsequent questions
             they were asked to choose among constant present value consumption paths with interest rates of 12% and 24%. From
             the slopes of the preferred paths and how the slopes change when the interest rate changes, one can estimate the rate
             of time preference and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.”13




    13
         The interest rates used in Barsky et al. (1997) are different than those used here.
A practical issue that arises because the number of consumption profiles is finite is that a person’s optimal
consumption path may lie somewhere between the paths offered. One option is to note that the person’s choice
implies bounds on the person’s optimal consumption profile and to use this information to construct bounds for a
person’s γ and β. Given that our primary interest is to examine whether constrained and unconstrained individuals
are similar, the approach we follow here is to use the zero and twelve percent interest rate questions and to assume
that the chosen profile in each case is the person’s optimal profile. The responses of 30 of the 307 respondents are
inconsistent with theory because they indicate that the slope of the consumption profile would decrease when the
interest rate is increased. Two other respondents have unusable responses. Table Suppl.4 shows the distribution of
γ for the remaining 275 students in the sample. Consistent with the findings of Barsky et al. (1997), the modal (and
in our case median) person chose consumption paths at the zero interest rate and the twelve percent interest rate that
had the same slope. Under the assumption that the person’s choice is his optimal choice, this would imply that γ=0.
It is probably most reasonable to simply interpret these patterns as evidence that the elasticity of substitution is low
for these people. This is what we find more generally; consistent with Barsky et al. (1997) we find that most people
have elasticities of intertemporal substitution close to zero and very few people have elasticities as high as one (i.e.,
consistent with log utility). Of particular interest to this paper, we find no evidence of differences between
constrained and unconstrained individuals.
         Equation B.1 indicates that it is not possible to compute the discount factor for the 158 individuals who do
not vary the slope of their consumption profile when the interest rate changes. This implies that the number of
constrained students for which a discount factor can be computed is small when only the zero and twelve percent
interest rates are used. In an effort to increase this number, we examined the consumption profile associated with
the twenty-four percent interest rate for the 158 individuals who did not vary the slope of their consumption profile
between the zero and twelve percent interest rates. Forty-five of the 158 increased the slope of their profile at
twenty-four percent, while 6 of the 158 violated economic theory by decreasing their profiles. Thus, we were able
to compute discount factors for 127 unconstrained and 29 constrained individuals and the results are shown in Table
Suppl.4. The responses indicate that people care a lot about the future in the sense that many would choose an upward
sloping consumption profile at a zero interest rate (i.e., β<0). While the sample sizes of constrained and
unconstrained individuals are much smaller than ideal, we find no evidence of differences by constraint status.
B.3.b. Differences in personal characteristics/situations potentially related to enjoyment of school
         Information on certain other family and personal factors that might influence how much a person enjoys
being in college relative to not being in college is shown at the end of Table 1. One personal factor that seemingly
could influence the drop-out decision is personal health or the health of individuals in a person’s family. We ask
specifically about student health on the initial survey and find no evidence of a difference between constrained and
unconstrained individuals with .099 of the former and .059 of the latter indicating at the time of college entrance that
they are in poor or fair health (Health_bad) .
         Another factor that could influence whether a student leaves school is whether he (she) has a boyfriend
(girlfriend) that does not attend Berea. As seen at end of Table 1, although we find that beginning college with a
boyfriend/girlfriend elsewhere is quite common (Bfriend/Gfriend), we do not find differences between constrained
and unconstrained individuals in this respect. To some extent, this variable measures a student’s attachment to
his/her hometown. We can measure this directly using two survey questions in the BPS. The first question is
“Assume that you graduate from Berea. What is the percent chance (number of chances out of 100) that in 10 years
you will be living within 100 miles of your hometown.” The second question asks person to assume that he does
not graduate from Berea. As can be seen in Table 1, we find no evidence of a difference between constrained and
unconstrained individuals in the resulting variables Home_grad and Home_dropout.
B.3.c. A direct approach
         The final approach we take to examine the third factor is more direct. At the beginning of the academic
year, we asked individuals the following question about their beliefs regarding how enjoyable school will be relative
to being out of school.
Question 1.A. Circle the one answer that best describes your beliefs at this time:
1. I believe that being in college at Berea will be much more enjoyable than not being in college.
2. I believe that being in college at Berea will be somewhat more enjoyable than not being in college.
3. I believe that I will enjoy being in college at Berea about the same amount as I would enjoy not being in
college.
4. I believe that being in college at Berea will be somewhat less enjoyable than not being in college.
5. I believe that being in college at Berea will be much less enjoyable than not being in college.
At the time of college entrance, we reject the null hypothesis that beliefs about how enjoyable school will be are
different for constrained and unconstrained individuals. For example, .645 of constrained students and .699 of
unconstrained students indicate that being in school will be much more enjoyable than not being in school
(Sch_enjoyable), and test of the null hypothesis that the difference in the population proportions is zero has a t-
statistic of less than one. Similarly, .064 of constrained students and .025 of unconstrained students indicate that
being in school will be somewhat less enjoyable or much less enjoyable than not being in school (Sch_unenjoyable),
and a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in the population proportions is zero has a t-statistic of
approximately .8.14




    14
      We are interested in whether differences in answers to this question would exist by constraint status if constrained and
    unconstrained students had the same consumption. Our answers deviate from this “consumption held constant” situation
    if constrained individuals believe at the time of entrance that they will have less money for consumption and believe
    that having less money for consumption will make them less happy in school relative to being out of school. However,
    if this was the case, the effect of comparing the answers to this question across constraint groups would be to understate
    how enjoyable constrained students would find school relative to the unconstrained students if the feasible consumption
    set were the same across groups.
