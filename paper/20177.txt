                                            ABSTRACT

In 7KH&KDQJLQJ%RG\ (Cambridge University Press and NBER, 2011), the authors presented a series
of estimates showing the number of calories available for human consumption in England and Wales
at various points in time between 1700 and 1909/13. The current paper corrects an error in those figures
but also compares the estimates of 7KH&KDQJLQJ%RG\ with those published by a range of other authors.
The differences reflect disagreements over a number of issues, including the amount of land under
cultivation, the extraction and wastage rates for cereals and pulses and the number of animals supplying
meat and dairy products. The paper considers recent attempts to achieve a compromise between these
estimates and challenges claims that there was a dramatic reduction in either food availability or the
average height of birth cohorts in the late-eighteenth century.

Recent years have witnessed the publication of several efforts to estimate the number

of calories available for human consumption in Britain from the thirteenth century

onwards. Although these papers have often drawn on similar sources, they have

sometimes reached quite divergent conclusions about both levels and trends. These

disagreements have profound implications for our understanding of a range of issues,

including the measurement of basic living standards, the relationship between diet and

health, and the impact of food availability on economic growth, both in the British Isles

and more widely.

     This paper follows a number of other authors in seeking to navigate a route

between these conflicting estimates and methods. The first section offers a more

detailed summary of some of the major publications and their findings. The paper

then offers a more detailed analysis of some of the reasons for the differences between

them. The final section highlights some of the problems associated with the attempt

to construct composite series and relates this discussion to the analysis of trends in

real wages, height and mortality in Britain.




1.   Estimating food availability

During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of authors attempted to reconstruct the

dietary history of the British population using evidence from the household budgets

collected by contemporary investigators such as David Davies (1795), Frederick Morton

Eden (1797), William Neild (1842), Edward Smith (Parliamentary Papers 1863; 1864)

and others (see Oddy 1990: 269). However, these reconstructions were marred by

disagreements over the selection of relevant budgets and the representativeness of the
                                                                                         3


populations from which they were drawn (Harris 2004: 386-7; Floud et al. 2011: 152-4).

This helped to fuel a growing interest in the use of agricultural accounts to estimate

the total amount of food which was produced in Britain at different points in time.

     One of the earliest attempts to estimate food availability from these sources was

made by Mark Overton and Bruce Campbell in a paper which was originally published

(in French) in Histoire et Mésure in 1996 (Overton and Campbell 1996). An English-

language version was presented to a session at the World Economic History Congress

in Helsinki ten years later (Overton and Campbell 2006). The authors estimated the

total number of calories provided by a number of different cereal crops and by

potatoes for a series of years between 1300 and 1871. Based on these figures, they

estimated that the total number of calories provided by these crops fell from a possible

peak of around 1669 calories per head per day in 1380 to 1060 calories per head per

day 491 years later. However, when these figures were added to the number of

calories supplied by imported foods, the total number of calories from potatoes and

grains in 1871 rose from 1060 to 1796 (Overton and Campbell 1996: 296; 2006: 45).

     Although Overton and Campbell’s original paper has not always received the

attention it deserved (it was overlooked by Robert Fogel in The escape from hunger

[2004] and by Floud et al. [2011] in The changing body, and was also omitted from the

Bibliography of Robert Allen’s unpublished but widely-cited discussion paper [Allen

2005]), it has formed the basis of the food calculations which Overton and Campbell

have undertaken with Stephen Broadberry, Alexander Klein and Bas van Leeuwen for

their forthcoming study of British economic growth from 1270 to 1870 (Broadberry et

al., forthcoming). This study incorporates a number of changes to Overton and

Campbell’s original estimates and combines them with estimates of the number of

calories derived from non-arable sources. The most recent version (5 August 2013)
                                                                                       4


suggests that aggregate consumption rose after the Black Death and reached a peak of

2467 calories per person per day during the 1380s. This level was not regained until

the 1860s.

     A further attempt to estimate food production and consumption levels was

undertaken by Robert Allen in 2005. Allen estimated the number of calories generated

by domestically-provided and imported foodstuffs in 1300, 1500, 1700, 1750, 1800

and 1850. His calculations suggested that per capita food consumption almost

doubled between 1300 and 1500. It fell slightly between 1500 and 1700 and rose

dramatically between 1700 and 1750. It then declined even more dramatically over the

course of the next century (Allen 2005: 39).

     Allen’s estimates for the period after 1700 contrast quite sharply with the figures

published by Robert Fogel in 2004 (Fogel 2004: 9), and by Floud, Fogel, Harris and

Hong in 2011 (Floud et al. 2011: 160). Floud and his co-authors used different

assessments of average crop yields to generate two separate estimates of the number

of calories generated by the domestic production of cereals and pulses, and then

combined these with data on meat and dairy production and calories from imported

foodstuffs. Their published estimates incorporated a spreadsheet error (first identified

by Deborah Oxley) which led them to underestimate the number of calories derived

from domestic wheat production in 1750 but their corrected figures (summarised in

Table 1) suggest that, despite some variations, average food consumption increased by

between 210 and 243 calories between 1700 and 1800, and by between 505 and 538

calories per person per day between 1800 and the eve of the First World War.

     As a number of commentators have pointed out, there are strong methodological

similarities between Floud et al.’s work and that of Craig Muldrew. However, their
                                                                                          5


results are very different. Whereas Floud and his co-authors argued that average

calorie consumption rose from 2229 calories per person per day in 1700 to between

2439 and 2472 calories a century later, Muldrew (2011: 156) claimed that the number

of calories supplied by grain products alone in 1700 was 2682, and that the number of

calories from all foodstuffs was 3579. He also suggested that total food availability

increased by more than 41 per cent between 1700 and 1770, before falling by just

over 21 per cent between 1770 and 1800. Unfortunately, his figures did not extend

beyond that date. However, they implied that average daily calorie consumption per

head in 1800 was exactly one thousand calories greater than the figure which Floud et

al. derived from the data published by the Royal Society for the period 1909-13 (Floud

et al. 2011: 160).

     A number of authors have attempted to steer a middle way between these

conflicting estimates. Although Morgan Kelly and Cormac Ó Gráda drew on some of

the work published by Fogel and Floud et al., they focused most of their attention on

the estimates of Broadberry et al. and Muldrew. After looking at the individual

components of each set of estimates, they concluded that, whilst Muldrew’s figures

were clearly ‘over-generous’, those published by Broadberry and his coauthors were in

need of ‘upward revision’ (Kelly and Ó Gráda 2012: 17; 2013a: 1150, 1153; 2013b: 2).

However, even with these revisions, their own suggestions still allowed for a very wide

margin of error for particular years (see Appendix 1).

     A rather different approach has been taken by David Meredith and Deborah Oxley

(2014). They compared Muldrew’s estimates with those published by Floud et al., and

then experimented with different scenarios in which they applied the conversion ratios

employed by the different authors to each other’s data. They also compared the

results with a reassessment of anthropometric trends and data from household

budgets. They concluded that the most plausible scenario was one in which Floud et

al.’s conversion ratios (for seeding, animal feed, processing and wastage) were applied

to Muldrew’s data for the eighteenth century and then merged with Floud et al.’s own

results for the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. These calculations led to a

substantial reduction in the size of Muldrew’s eighteenth-century estimates, but still

left room for a sharp fall in food availability between circa 1770 and 1850.

     Although these papers cover a number of different periods, the main areas of

divergence concentrate on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Within this period,

it is possible to identify two broad schools of thought (see Figure 1 and Appendix 1).

The first school, represented particularly by Broadberry et al. and Floud et al., suggests

that food availability was generally low, and that there was relatively little change

before the early-to-middle years of the nineteenth century. The second school,

represented especially by Robert Allen and Craig Muldrew, argues that food availability

was much greater during the first 50-70 years of the eighteenth century, and fell

sharply between circa 1770 and 1850. In order to investigate these issues further, we

begin by looking more closely at the similarities and differences between the accounts

presented by Broadberry et al. and Floud et al.. We then contrast Floud et al.’s

estimates with those published by Muldrew before looking at the compromise position

proposed by Meredith and Oxley.

2.                   Optimists and pessimists

Although Floud et al. and Broadberry et al. reached similar conclusions, they did not

necessarily reach them in the same way, and their results were not identical. In view of

this, it is appropriate to consider the different routes taken towards their final figures

in more detail.

Floud et al. based their estimates on the amount of land under cultivation on figures

originally published by Chartres (1985: 444), Allen (1994: 112) and Holderness (1989:

145). Although both Chartres (1985: 145) and Holderness (1989: 126, 139, 142; see

also Allen 1994: 103) appear to have been referring to the whole of England and Wales,
                                                                                           9


they reached different conclusions about the amount of land under cultivation in 1750.

Floud et al. (2011: 205-7) followed Allen (1994: 112) in preferring Holderness’ figures,

partly because Chartres did not attempt to estimate the amount of land used for beans

and peas, and partly to provide continuity with Holderness’ figures for 1800 and 1850.

However, when Allen returned to the subject in 2005, he used Chartres’ figures (Allen

2005: 28). If Floud et al. had also used these figures, their overall estimate for the

number of calories consumed per person per day in 1750 would have been between

138 calories (Estimate A) and 144 calories (Estimate B) higher.

     Floud et al.’s figures can also be compared with those of Broadberry et al. in

Table 2, although Broadberry et al.’s figures appear to refer to England only. Their

figures suggest that the total amount of land devoted to the cultivation of wheat, rye,

barley, oats and pulses was less than the figures published by Floud et al. for 1700

and 1750, but greater than Floud et al.’s figures for 1800. Whereas Floud et al.

believed that the land devoted to these crops increased between 1800 and 1850,

Broadberry et al. suggested a decline. However, they also claimed that the acreage

devoted to other crops increased, so that the total amount of land under cultivation

rose by just under 1.2 million acres.




2.2. Yields per acre

Floud et al. (2011) published two different sets of estimates for yields per acre. Their

initial estimates were based on the yields reported by Chartres (1985: 444) and Allen

(1994: 112) for 1700, and by Holderness (1989: 145) for 1750, 1800 and 1850. They

also published a second set of estimates, based on work by Turner, Beckett and Afton

(2001: 129, 153, 158, 163-4) for the period from 1750 onwards. However, Turner and
                                                                                          10


his co-authors did not publish estimates for the productivity of rye in 1750, and their

results may not have been entirely representative (Thirsk 2002). The corrected version

of Floud et al.’s study suggests that the first of these two estimates may therefore

provide a more appropriate guide to the general trend over the period as a whole

(Floud et al., forthcoming).

     Broadberry et al. published an initial, and fuller, version of their latest estimates

in 2011. This paper forms the basis of the chapter on ‘Consumption’ in their

forthcoming volume. It is difficult to compare their estimates directly with those
                                                                                                      11


published by Floud et al. because their figures are for crop yields net of seed and it is

not possible to estimate gross yields directly from the information in their paper.

However, we can infer the figures for wheat, rye, barley and oats from the estimates

published by Overton and Campbell in 1996. The data in Table 3 suggest that the two

sets of authors reached broadly similar conclusions about the productivity of wheat,

but Broadberry and his coauthors were generally more pessimistic about the

productivity of barley and oats, and probably also more pessimistic about the

productivity of beans and peas. They proposed higher estimates for the productivity of

rye and maslin in 1700 and 1750, but lower estimates for these crops in 1800 and

1850.

2.3. Calories from cereals and pulses

Both Broadberry et al. and Floud et al. drew on McCance and Widdowson’s (1960)

exhaustive account of The composition of foods when estimating calorie values.

However, as we can see from Table 4, they nevertheless reached slightly different

conclusions about the calorific value of barley and oats. Broadberry et al. also appear

to have used slightly lower values for beans and peas.

Notes. These figures have been calculated from Broadberry et al., forthcoming: Tables
8.1 and 8.5. The figures for wheat, rye, barley and oats are very similar to those
published by Kelly and Ó Gráda (2012: 19; 2013a: 1138).

2.4. Potatoes

It is generally agreed that potatoes formed an increasingly important part of the

national diet during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but the details of the

increase remain contentious. Allen (2005: 28) argued that the amount of land devoted

to potatoes increased steadily from 1700 onwards. Overton and Campbell (1996: 292;

2006: 37) did not attempt to estimate patterns of cultivation in 1750, with the result
                                                                                        13


that their figures show no evidence of potato cultivation before 1800. Broadberry et al.

(2011: 36-7) also assumed a constant rate of increase from 1700 to 1800, but at lower

levels than Allen. Floud et al. (2011: 221) based their figures on those published by

Radcliffe Salaman (1949: 61-3), but many of these figures were highly conjectural.

Floud et al. assumed that the amount of land under cultivation by potatoes increased

steadily from 1600 to 1775, whereas Salaman (149: 537) himself thought that there

was little active cultivation before 1770. He derived his own estimates for 1775 and

1795 from contemporary accounts which suggested that the consumption of potatoes

was widespread in the north of England during the 1790s; and he estimated the

amount of land under cultivation in 1814 and 1838 from contemporary Scottish figures.

Even the figures for 1851 had to be inferred from James Caird’s (1852) attempts to

estimate the total amount of land used for potatoes, turnips and mangolds (Salaman

1949: 612-3).

     In order to compare the number of calories derived from these estimates, we have

assumed that each pound of potatoes supplied 368 calories; that each bushel

contained 60 pounds; and that each acre yielded 150 bushels throughout the period

(see Table 5). We have also used Overton and Campbell’s (1996: 41; 2006: 294)

estimate of the difference between gross and net yields to estimate the number of

calories ‘lost’ for seeding purposes.

     The results of this exercise are shown in Table 5. The absolute values of the

figures generated from each set of authors differ less dramatically than the trends.

Allen’s figures imply that potatoes already accounted for a significant proportion of

total consumption at the start of the eighteenth century, and that their significance

increased between 1700 and 1750. They also suggest that per capita consumption

peaked during the second half of the eighteenth century and declined between 1800
                                                                                      14


and 1850. Broadberry et al. imply that potato consumption increased from a minimal

level in 1700 to around 113 calories per head in 1750. They also suggest that potato

consumption continued to rise, albeit at a lower rate, between 1750 and 1800 and

remained at much the same level between 1800 and 1830, before declining between

1830 and 1871. Floud et al. suggest that consumption rose quite slowly between

1700 and 1750, and more rapidly between 1750 and 1800. Their figures suggest that

the rate of increase continued to accelerate between 1800 and 1850.




2.5. Extraction rates

In order to estimate the proportion of the total crop which became available for human

consumption, it is necessary to make allowances for seeding, the consumption of grain

by animals, processing, distribution and wastage. Floud et al. (2011: 205-9) used data

from the United States to estimate the proportion of cereals and pulses ‘lost’ as a

result of seeding, animal consumption and processing, and allowed an extra ten per

cent for wastage. They assumed that the gross extraction rate (the amount of food

available for human consumption as a proportion of the gross yield of each crop)

remained constant over the whole of the period from 1700 to 1850.

Notes. Bushels per acre are based on Overton and Campbell (1996: 37; 2006: 292). The difference between gross and
net yields is based on Overton and Campbell 1996: 41; 2006: 294. English population figures are taken from Wrigley
and Schofield 1981: 533-5. It is worth noting that, although the figures published by Overton and Campbell are
consistent with the idea that each bushel contained approximately 60 lbs in 1800 and 1830, their figures for 1871
suggested that the number of pounds per bushel in that year was closer to 76.

       These assumptions have not escaped criticism. Kelly and Ó Gráda (2012: 31;

2013b: 2) argued that ‘Floud et al.’s assumed proportions of wheat, barley and rye

entering gross product … seem to be on the low side’ and that ‘the assumed losses

from processing and distribution may be too high except, perhaps, in the case of

barley’. Meredith and Oxley (2014: 180) also thought that Floud et al.’s ‘assumptions

regarding loss … are arguably very high’ although, as we shall see, this did not prevent

them from accepting the same rates when performing their final calculations.

       It is difficult to compare the impact of these assumptions directly with those

made by Broadberry et al. because Broadberry and his co-authors only showed the
                                                                                        16


proportion of the total crop which remained available for human consumption after

making an initial allowance for seeding. However, we can address this for some crops

using the figures on gross and net yields in Overton and Campbell’s paper (1996: 292-

5; 2006: 37-44). Their figures enable us to make separate calculations for the

proportions of the original crop which were ‘lost’ in the form of seeds, animal

consumption, wastage and processing for wheat, rye, barley and oats.

     The results of this exercise are shown in Table 6. As we have already explained,

Floud et al. assumed that the proportion of each crop which entered gross production

remained constant throughout the period, as did the proportions lost through

processing and wastage. Overton and Campbell suggested that the extraction rates of

wheat and rye both increased between 1700 and 1830. This was because the amount

of grain which was used for seeding remained constant at 2.5 bushels per acre, with

the result that the proportion fell as the total yield increased. Floud et al. also

suggested that the extraction rates for these two crops were consistently lower than

the figures suggested by Overton and Campbell throughout the period, but their

figures for barley were greater, and their figures for oats became greater as the period

progressed. When the extraction rates for all four crops are combined, Floud et al.’s

figures are also lower, but not excessively so. Floud et al. estimated a combined

extraction rate of between 30 and 33 per cent, whereas Overton and Campbell’s figure

was around 36 per cent.




2.6. Meat and dairy products

Floud et al. and Broadberry et al. derived their estimates of the numbers of calories

from meat and dairy products from different sources. Broadberry et al. derived their
                                                                                       17


information from studies by John (1989: 1042-6), Clark (1991: 216) and Allen (2005:

29, 33). Floud et al. drew their information from King (1696: 54-5) and Holderness

(1989: 155, 170). They also sought to estimate the number of calories derived from

lard with information from US sources (Bennett and Pierce 1961: 114-5).

     Although meat and dairy products only accounted for a minority of total calories

between 1700 and 1850, the differences between the two sets of estimates are

noticeable. Broadberry et al. (2011: 59; forthcoming: Table 8.7) increased the total

value of ‘non-arable’ foods by adding 200 calories per person per day for fish and

poultry, whereas Floud et al. (2011: 156) only allowed 24 extra calories from fish and

made no allowances for poultry, game or rabbits before the twentieth century.

However, Broadberry et al.’s other estimates were much lower. They suggested that

the number of calories derived from beef, mutton, pork and dairy products accounted

for no more than 380 calories per day between 1700/09 and 1850/59, whereas Floud

et al.’s estimates ranged from 538 calories to 786.

Notes. Overton and Campbell (1996: 294; 2006: 41) did not include estimates of the gross and net numbers of calories from rye in 1871. However, their estimates for the amount of land
under cultivation were the same as for 1800 and 1830. Changes in the ‘total’ extraction rate for Floud et al. reflect changes in the proportion of land under cultivation for each crop and in
the gross yields per crop. The ‘total’ figures for Floud et al.’s Estimate B would therefore be as follows: 1750: 0.2909; 1800: 0.3072; 1850: 0.3120.

Notes. In column 1, the figure for veal is from Bennett and Pierce 1961: 116-7; all other figures are from Broadberry et al., forthcoming, Table 8.5. In columns 2-5,
figures for milk, cheese and butter are derived from Broadberry et al., forthcoming: Table 8.6; all other figures have been calculated from the figures in Broadberry et
al. 2011: Tables 7 and 23. The figures in the final row of columns 2-5 differ from Broadberry et al.’s published figures because they use information from a different
source to calculate the number of calories derived from veal and because they combine data from Broadberry et al.’s two publications. The published totals are as
follows: Broadberry et al. 2011: 1700/09: 236; 1750/59: 292; 1800/09: 379; 1850/59: 328; Broadberry et al., forthcoming: 1700/09: 210; 1750/59: 319; 1800/09:
385; 1850/59: 328.

Sources: Col. 1: Broadberry et al., forthcoming: Table 8.5; Bennett and Pierce 1961: 116-7; Cols. 2-5: Broadberry et al. 2011: Table 7; Broadberry et al., forthcoming:
Table 8.6; Cols. 6-10: Floud et al. 2011: Tables D5 and D5.
                                                                                        21


      There appear to be two main reasons for these differences. In the first place,

Broadberry et al. used much lower calorific values to estimate the amount of energy

derived from pork, cheese and butter. As we can see from Table 7, much of the

difference between their estimates of the number of calories derived from these

sources and Floud et al.’s estimates can be attributed to this cause. The second

source of variation is the amount of meat derived from cattle, but the ultimate cause of

this difference is unclear. Broadberry et al. suggest that they derived their estimates of

the numbers of animals from Allen (2005) and John (1989: 1042-6), but their figures

are much closer to the latter (see Table 8). This may help to explain why their overall

estimates are so much lower than the figures which Allen himself proposed (Appendix

1).




2.7. Imports and exports

Of the various authors whose work has been considered in this paper, only Overton

and Campbell (1996: 45; 2006: 296, Allen (2005: 39), Broadberry et al. (2011: 59;

forthcoming: Table 8.7) and Floud et al. (2011) framed their own estimates of the

number of calories derived from imported foodstuffs. Meredith and Oxley (2014: 169-

70) made no allowance for imports or exports in 1770, but used Floud et al.’s figures

for 1700, 1800 and 1850. However, Floud et al. were the only authors who attempted

to go beyond the production of estimates for arable, meat and dairy products, and only

Floud et al. and Broadberry et al. provided much information about the sources of their

figures. Broadberry et al. (forthcoming: section 8.2.1) derived their figures from those

published by Mitchell (1988), whereas Floud et al. derived their figures for 1800 and

1850 from the Parliamentary Papers (see Floud et al. 2011: 212-19 for further details).
                                                                                        22


However, although this enabled them to supplement Mitchell’s figures with imports of

other cereals and pulses (including maize, rye, peas, beans, buckwheat, beer or bigg

and malt) their calorie totals were lower. This may have been because they applied the

same allowances for losses due to milling and distribution as they applied to domestic

cereals.

      Overall, Broadberry et al.’s estimates differ from those published by Floud et al.

in two important respects (see Table 9). In the first place, they argued that the calorific

value of imported grain products increased steadily from the 1750s onwards. Floud et

al. argued that Britain was a net exporter of grain calories in 1700 and 1750, and – as

we have already noted – they believed that the calorific value of imported grains in

1800 and 1850 was below the level suggested by Broadberry et al. for 1800/09 and

1850/59. The second major difference arises from the fact that Floud et al. also

estimated the calorific value of other imported foods. Broadberry et al. (forthcoming:

Table 8.10) acknowledged the importance of sugar and other imported items when

they discussed the per capita consumption of imported luxury foodstuffs (including

tobacco!) but failed to incorporate these figures in their estimation of food values.




3.   Food availability in a high-wage economy?

Despite the similarity between Broadberry et al. and Floud et al.’s overall figures, there

are also some important differences in the ways they have been constructed. By

comparing these approaches, it would doubtless be possible to exchange some of the

assumptions made by each set of authors in order to bring their final conclusions even

closer together. However, they would still differ substantially from the ‘high wage’

estimates preferred by Allen (2005) and Muldrew (2011).

Notes. The notes to Broadberry et al.’s table also refer to estimates published by A.H. John (1989: 1042-6). He proposed the following figures for the numbers of different types of animal in
1770 and 1854: 1770: cows: 0.74 million; young cattle: 0.91 million; fatting cattle: 0.51 million; sheep: 22.19 million; swine: 1.71 million; 1854: milch cows: 1.38 million; calves: 0.71
million; other cattle: 1.34 million; sheep: 12.12 million; swine: 2.36 million. As with Allen’s figures, these estimates refer to the whole of England and Wales.

Notes: The figures attributed to Broadberry et al. for grain imports in 1800/09 and 1850/59 differ slightly from those published in 2011. Their earlier figures (Broadberry et al. 2011: 59)
were as follows: 1800/09: grain imports: 166 calories; 1850/59: grain imports: 537 calories.

Sources : Broadberry et al. 2011 : 59 ; forthcoming : Table 8.7 ; Floud et al. 2011 : 159.

     In view of this, it may be more profitable to compare both sets of estimates – and

especially those of Floud et al. – with those published by the other authors. However,

it is much easier to compare Floud et al.’s estimates with Muldrew’s. This is partly

because we have already used some of Allen’s figures in the previous section but

mainly because Muldrew provided a great deal more information about the foundations

on which his figures were built.

     Although Muldrew’s overall figures were much higher than Floud et al.’s, they

were actually based on a somewhat narrower range of comestibles. Muldrew’s

eighteenth-century consumers derived 29.9 calories from poultry (including chickens,

turkeys, geese and ducks) and deer in 1700 and 42.1 calories in 1770, but they

obtained nothing from either potatoes or fish. Using information from Devon in the

mid-eighteenth century, he estimated that the average person derived 191.2 calories

per day from cider in 1700, but nothing in 1770, and he did not include any calories

from fruit sources in his final figures (Muldrew 2011: 154-7).

     In order to compare Muldrew’s estimates directly with those of Floud et al., we

can begin by identifying the areas of greatest agreement. Table 10 compares the

figures used by the different authors to convert bushels into pounds and to estimate

the energy derived from the same amounts of cereals and pulses. It shows that Floud

et al. and Muldrew made very similar assumptions about the weight of each bushel and

the calorific value of the main cereal crops. However, Muldrew attached a much higher

value to the calorific value of beans and peas. If he had used the same conversion

factor as Floud et al., the estimated value of the number of calories derived from these

sources would have fallen by 119.64 calories in 1700, 137.56 calories in 1770, and

111.16 calories per person per day in 1800.

Notes. The calorie figures differ from those published by Kelly and Ó Gráda (2012: 33
[Table A5]; 2013b: 3 [Appendix Table 2]). In his book, Muldrew published different
figures for the number of calories per pound of each crop in the text and in Table 3.14
(Muldrew 2011: 140-9). The figures in Table 3.14 reflect the number of calories per
pound after allowing for milling (so, for example, the number of calories per pound of
wheat is given as 1,431 in the text and 1,324 calories in the table). Kelly and Ó
Gráda’s figures appear to have been derived from the figures in Muldrew’s table.
However, it is still not clear how they estimated the number of calories per ounce of
oats.

[Table A5]; 2013b: 3 [Appendix Table 2].


       As we have already seen, Floud et al. generated two different sets of figures for

the average productivity of each crop, based on estimates derived from Chartres (1985)

and Holderness (1989) in the first instance, and from Chartres, Holderness and Turner,

Beckett and Afton (2001) in the second. The differences between the two sets of

estimates were minimal in the case of barley, but the figures derived from Chartres and

Holderness generated lower estimates for wheat in 1750 and rye in 1800, and for oats

in both 1750 and 1800. On the other hand, they generated higher estimates for the

productivity of beans and peas in both years. Muldrew’s estimates were based more

closely on the figures published by Turner, Beckett and Afton, and this is reflected in
                                                                                                                   26


Table 11. However, his figures for wheat in 1750 were closer to Floud et al.’s Estimate

A than their Estimate B.

Notes. In order to make the two sets of figures more directly comparable, we have interpolated between Floud et al.’s
figures for 1750 and 1800 to generate a set of estimates for 1770, and between Muldrew’s estimates for 1700 and
1770 to generate an estimate for 1750. Muldrew explained his allowances for seeding in his text, and these have been
added to the figures in Table 3.14 of his study to generate the figures for gross yields in this table.

         Disagreements over the calorific value of different crops and average yields per

acre are much less important than the different authors’ attempts to estimate the

amount of land under cultivation and the conversion of total yields into edible

foodstuffs. In order to estimate the total amount of land under cultivation, it is

important to recognise that Muldrew’s figures were only partially based on direct

information. Although they were derived from Overton’s (1996: 76) study, Muldrew

estimated the total amount of land under cultivation in 1770 by interpolating between

Overton’s figures for 1700 and 1800 and then reallocated some of the land from

barley to wheat in order to generate new figures for each crop (Muldrew 2011: 144,

148).

         It may also be helpful to compare both sets of estimates with those published by

other authors. Although Floud et al.’s figures for the amount of land devoted to wheat
                                                                                        27


are generally towards the lower end of the range of published estimates, their estimate

of the total amount of land under cultivation by cereals and pulses was closer to the

centre (see Table 12). By contrast, Muldrew’s figures suggest that the amount of land

devoted to wheat in 1770 was 860,000 acres greater than the highest estimate for

1750, and his figure for 1800 was 130,000 acres greater than the next highest figure

for the same year. Overall, he suggested that the amount of land devoted to all cereals

and pulses in 1770 was 980,000 acres greater than the highest figure for 1750, and

also greater than any of the other published estimates for 1800. His own figure for

1800 was nearly 1.2 million acres higher than the next published figure.

     Muldrew’s figures also raise three further questions. As we have already seen,

Muldrew derived his figures for the total amount of land under cultivation from

Overton’s 1996 study. However, although Overton (1996: 76) argued that these

figures applied to the whole of England and Wales, Muldrew (2011: 142-3) appears to

have divided the total amount of food produced from this land among the population

of England alone. The second problem is that Overton himself argued that these

figures had been superseded by the work he published with Bruce Campbell in the

same year (Overton and Campbell 1996: 282; 2006: 29). The third problem is that

Muldrew also assumed that the total amount of land under cultivation grew at a

consistent rate between 1700 and 1800, but this assumption is called into question by

the figures which Overton published with Broadberry, Campbell, Klein and van

Leeuwen (Broadberry et al. 2011: 36). As we can see from Table 13, these figures

imply that the total amount of land devoted to the cultivation of cereals and pulses fell

from 6.36 million acres in 1700 to 6.31 million acres in 1750. The amount of land

associated with the cultivation of wheat fell, according to their calculations, from 1.99
                                                                                                                 28


million acres to 1.95, whereas Muldrew’s calculations imply that it increased from 1.6

million acres to 2.57 million acres over the same period (see Table 12).

Notes. For the methods used to calculate values for Floud et al. in 1770 and Muldrew in 1750, see Table 10.

Sources: Floud et al. 2011: 205-7; Muldrew 2011: 142-3.




         The second major cause of variation lies in the different assumptions which Floud

et al. and Muldrew made when they converted the original crop into edible food. This

can involve up to four separate calculations, taking account of the amount of grain

used for seed, the proportion used as animal feed, processing, and distribution and

wastage.

         As we have already seen, Floud et al. (2011: 154) did not distinguish between the

amount of grain used for seed and the amount fed to animals when they calculated the

proportion of cereals and pulses entering gross product. However, they assumed

implicitly that this figure was a constant proportion of the gross yield. By contrast,

most other authors have assumed that the amount used as seed was a constant or

even declining figure (see e.g. Overton and Campbell 1996: 292-5; 2006: 37-44; Allen

2005: 34), and that the proportion of each grain which was used as seed also declined

as productivity increased. This explains why Muldrew’s figures show that the
                                                                                          29


proportion of each crop which remained after seeding increased over the course of the

period (Table 14).

     Table 14 also enables us to see the amount of grain which Muldrew allocated to

animals. He assumed that the only crops fed to animals were oats, beans and peas.

However, in contrast to Overton and Campbell (1996: 292-5; 2006: 37-44), he also

assumed that the proportion of the oat crop which was fed to animals declined over

the course of the century, with the result that a much higher proportion of the original

crop remained available for human consumption. On the other hand, he also assumed

that animals consumed a higher proportion of beans and peas.

     One of the most important areas of disagreement concerns the amount of crop

lost as a result of processing and wastage. Muldrew (2011: 146-7) assumed that none

of the wheat, rye or beans and peas was lost as a result of processing and that, after

making allowances for seeding, only 7.5 per cent of the remaining crop was lost as a

result of wastage (primarily, as a result of mice and mould). He argued that a similar

proportion of the barley and oat crop was also wasted, but that these losses were

augmented by the effects of processing. He assumed that forty per cent of the raw oat

crop was lost in the process of converting it to oatmeal, which brought his final figure

much closer to Floud et al.’s, but that only twenty per cent of barley was lost in this

way. In contrast to Overton and Campbell (1996: 292-5; 2006: 37-44), he also

assumed that the proportion of barley brewed as beer remained constant over the

course of the century, whereas they assumed that it increased.

Notes: Floud et al.’s figures were derived from Chartres (for 1695/1700) and Holderness (1750-1850). For 1380, Overton and Campbell’s figures sum to 7.92 acres (shown here) but their published
figure was 7.98. They estimated the amount of land under cultivation by each crop in 1600 and 1700 by extrapolating their results for Cornwall, Hampshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and
Worcestershire. Young’s (1770) figure for the amount of fallow land (0.8 million acres) included ‘other crops’. Kain’s (1986) figures for 1836 and the Parliamentary figures for 1854 aggregate the
amount of land under cultivation by wheat and and rye. Asterisked publications refer to England only; all other publications refer to England and Wales as a whole.

Notes. Figures showing the gross yield per acre, proportions fed to livestock and allowances for processing and wastage have been derived from the text. All other figures are derived from Table 3.14 of Muldrew’s study. The figures
in column 12 differ from the published figures in column 13 as a result of rounding.

     Muldrew also reached different conclusions about the number of calories derived

from meat and, especially, dairy products. Although he estimated that the calorific

value of the meat derived from cattle, sheep and pigs was generally lower than Floud et

al., he also assumed that the number of animals was much larger. However, in

comparison with the estimated value of the food consumed from other sources, the

differences were not very large. If we bear in mind that our figures for Muldrew in

1750 and for Floud et al. in 1770 have been interpolated from other data, then the

information in Table 15 implies that Muldrew’s consumers derived substantially more

calories from meat in 1700 and 1770, but similar amounts in 1750 and 1800.

     These differences are less marked, and less systematic, than the differences in

the numbers of calories derived from dairy products. Floud et al. derived their

estimates of the number of calories obtained from milk, butter and cheese in 1750,

1800 and 1850 from Holderness (1989: 170) and estimated the number of dairy

calories in 1700 from the ratio of meat products to dairy products in 1750. Muldrew

estimated the total number of milk cows in 1700 using information from Gregory King

(1696) and then assumed that the number did not change for the rest of the century.

However, he did assume that the average yield per cow increased by 25 per cent

between 1700 and 1770. He did not attempt to distinguish between calories

consumed as milk and calories consumed as cheese or butter, but he did assume that

20 per cent of all calories were ‘lost’ in the form of animal feed.

Notes. Figures may differ slightly from published figures as a result of rounding.

     It is difficult to compare the two sets of figures directly because Floud et al. only

offered detailed breakdowns of their figures for 1750, 1800 and 1850, and Muldrew

only provided detailed figures for 1700 and 1770, although we can infer the nature of

his calculations for 1800 from this. However, Table 16 suggests that the two sets of

figures differ mainly because of assumptions about the number of animals producing

dairy products. Although King (1696: 54) estimated the overall number of ‘beeves,

sterks and calves’ as 4.5 million, he did not attempt to break the figures down further,

and Muldrew’s suggestion of 1.1 million milk cows must therefore be regarded as

conjecture. Both King’s figures and Muldrew’s can also be contrasted with the figures

suggested by Arthur Young in 1771 and by the Poor Law Inspectors in 1854. Young

(1771: 256-61) estimated that there were 741,532 milk cows in the whole of England

and Wales in 1770, and A.H. John’s (1989: 1044) calculations suggest that this figure

had only risen to 1.38 million more than eighty years later.

4.   The search for compromise

The number and variety of the estimates offered by different authors has encouraged

others to enter the field. Kelly and Ó Gráda have contrasted Broadberry et al.’s

estimates with Muldrew’s and suggested alternatives to both. However, some of their

revisions are quite approximate and they still leave a large gap between the two series

(Kelly and Ó Gráda 2012: 20 [Table 4]; 2013b: 3 [Appendix Table 3]; see also Appendix

1 below). Meredith and Oxley’s (2014) project was more ambitious. They contrasted

Muldrew’s estimates with those of Floud et al. and also examined the effect of applying

the different authors’ assumptions to each other’s data. This enabled them to

recalculate Muldrew’s figures by using Floud et al.’s assumptions about seeding,

animal consumption, processing and wastage, and adding the resulting estimates to

Muldrew’s own figures for the number of calories obtained from meat and dairy

products. They then combined these figures with Floud et al.’s data for imports and

exports in 1700 and 1800 to produce a new series of total calories available per

person per day net of trade, and used Floud et al.’s data for 1850 and 1909/13 to

extend this series to the start of the First World War.

     Although this strategy helps to modify some of Muldrew’s original claims, it also

raises new questions of its own. As we have already seen, there are some minor

differences between the figures which Muldrew and Floud et al. used to convert

bushels into pounds and to estimate the calorific value of different cereals, and a more

serious difference between the figures they used to calculate the calorific value of

beans and peas. They also used different values to calculate the number of calories

obtained from meat and dairy products. Although these differences are not

particularly dramatic, they do create inconsistencies when seeking to create a single
                                                                                       39


series which uses Muldrew’s values to estimate the number of calories derived from

domestic food products between 1700 and 1800, and Floud et al.’s values to calculate

the calorific value of domestically-produced food between 1850 and 1909/13, and the

calorific value of imported foods over the period as a whole.

     Meredith and Oxley’s paper also raises some important questions about the

overall trajectory of domestic agriculture during the eighteenth and nineteenth

centuries. As we have already seen, Muldrew did not attempt to extend his series

beyond 1800, and this meant that he was able to avoid a direct contrast between his

estimates and those of nineteenth-century observers. However, by combining his

figures on the amount of land under cultivation and the number of cattle in the

eighteenth century with Floud et al.’s figures for the nineteenth century, Meredith and

Oxley are forced into the position of not only accepting his eighteenth-century figures,

but also accepting that the pace of change during the first half of the nineteenth

century was much lower than other accounts might suggest. It then becomes

necessary to explain, not only why increases in domestic agricultural production were

so marked before 1800, but also why the pace of change was so much slower in the

fifty years which followed.

     Meredith and Oxley have also sought to reinforce their revised food estimates by

comparing them with information on prices and stature. They argue that ‘when

nutrition was improving over the eighteenth century, prices were low. When per capita

output dropped, food prices escalated, exacerbated by war expenditure. When war

ended, prices stabilised, but at a higher level than earlier, squeezing family incomes at

a time when families had more mouths than ever before’ (Meredith and Oxley 2014:

184). However, while this may be true, it is also important to take account of changing
                                                                                      40


wage levels. When wages and prices are combined, the case for nutritional pessimism

becomes less convincing.

     We can explore this question in more detail by comparing three sets of price and

wage estimates. Figure 2 is derived from Gregory Clark’s (2007: Table 4) calculations,

showing changes in farm workers’ wages and the cost of living between 1700 and

1849. It shows that prices did indeed rise sharply from the 1780s onwards, but so did

wages, and the increase in wages appears to have outstripped prices from the early-

1800s. Figure 3 compares Phelps Brown and Hopkins’ classic account of real wages in

the country as a whole with the more recent series published by Charles Feinstein

(1998) and Robert Allen (2007). In contrast to the earlier work, both Feinstein and

Allen find evidence of a slow improvement in purchasing power between 1770 and

1800, followed by a period of more rapid improvement beginning in either the 1820s

or 1830s.

     Meredith and Oxley have also compared changes in food availability with average

male stature. As they rightly suggest, ‘the dimensions of the human body – its height,

weight, body mass, waist-hip ratio – are clues to the nutritional experience of

individuals’ (Meredith and Oxley 2014: 184), although it is important to emphasise

that height itself measures the net impact of diet on human growth after taking

account of the demands imposed by physical activity and the disease environment.

Their argument that changes in average stature reflect increases in nutritional hardship

is based on four anthropometric series. Three of these are drawn from the

measurements of convicts and prisoners, and the fourth from military data.

     Meredith and Oxley obtained data on the heights of men who were imprisoned in

Bedford and Wandsworth (London), and compared these with the heights of convicts

who were transported from Britain to New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land. The

oldest men in the Wandsworth dataset were only born during the second decade of the

nineteenth century and therefore provide limited information about trends in height

before that period, and neither the Bedford prisoners nor the Australian convicts

provide unequivocal evidence of declines in stature before the 1820s (see Meredith and

Oxley 2014: 188-91). However, Meredith and Oxley also revisited Floud, Wachter and

Gregory’s (1990) military data. Their reworking of these statistics provided much

sharper evidence of a decline in stature from the birth cohorts of the 1770s onwards.

     The estimation of the height of eighteenth-century military recruits has long been

the subject of controversy. A number of authors, including John Komlos (Komlos

1993a; 1993b; Komlos and Küchenhoff 2012) and Francesco Cinnirella (2008), have

argued that the data provide evidence of declines in stature of up to five inches (12.7

cm) between the birth cohorts of the 1740s and the 1850s. By contrast, Floud,
                                                                                        43


Wachter and Gregory (1990: 134-49) argued that there was a slow and irregular

improvement in the average height of successive cohorts of British males born between

the 1740s and the 1820s.

     One of the main areas of contention has been the question of whether, and at

what point, it might be appropriate to pool the results obtained from the analysis of

the Army and the Marines. Komlos (1993a: 132) and Cinnirella (2008: 328) argued

that the two services recruited men from different sections of the population and

should therefore be treated separately. Floud, Wachter and Gregory (1990: 139-50;

1993: 147-8) disputed this, arguing that recruits to both the Army and the Marines

were drawn from the same section of the population (the male working class) and that

the allocation of recruits to different services was simply a matter of military

convenience.

     Meredith and Oxley agreed with Floud, Wachter and Gregory on this point.

However, they also noted that the Army and the Marines had different height profiles,

and they argued that Floud and his coauthors misrepresented the overall trend by

overweighting the proportion of Marines in the overall sample. They then recalculated

Floud, Wachter and Gregory’s results after reweighting the data to take account of the

actual proportions of Army and Marine recruits and excluding recruits from outside

England and Wales, and this formed the basis of their revised estimates (Meredith and

Oxley 2014: 188; see also Floud, Wachter and Gregory 1993: 147-8).

     Meredith and Oxley’s estimates represent an important contribution to

anthropometric history, but their decision to reweight the data according to the

proportions of Army and Marine recruits is surely open to question. They argued that

pooling the data without reweighting would be analogous to ‘mix[ing] up
                                                                                          44


disproportionate shares of males and females and consider[ing] the outcome

representative’ (Meredith and Oxley 2014: 187-8). However, the reason why it would

be inappropriate to mix up disproportionate (and varying) shares of males and females

is because the distributions of heights in the underlying populations are different. If

one accepts the view that both the Army recruits and the Marine recruits were drawn

from the same population, then it is appropriate to combine them, providing one

makes appropriate allowances for variations in the height standards used to select

them (see Floud, Wachter and Gregory 1990: 111-4; 1993: 147-8).

     Meredith and Oxley sought to allow for the effects of truncation by controlling for

the size of the Army and Marine establishments in the year of recruitment. Even

though this did not allow them to infer the actual heights of the underlying population,

they argued that it was sufficient to enable them to estimate overall trends (Meredith

and Oxley 2014: 188). However, other contributors to these debates have been much

less reticent. Indeed, many of the main disagreements between Komlos and Cinnirella,

and Floud and his coauthors, have concerned the identification and development of the

most appropriate procedures for making inferences about the heights of underlying

populations from truncated samples, and this remains a hotly-contested issue (see e.g.

Komlos 2004; Floud et al. 2011: 65-7, 137).

     In the absence of any unequivocal resolution of these debates, it may be more

appropriate, at this juncture, to compare the latest height series with changes in

mortality. Although there has been some debate over the course of mortality change

during the first half of the eighteenth century (Razzell 1994: 185-95; 1998: 485-500),

most observers seem content to accept Wrigley and Schofield’s broad depiction of

changes in life expectancy during the second half of the eighteenth century and the

first half of the nineteenth century (see e.g. Hinde 2003: 184, 194). However, as we
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              45


can see from Figure 4, these data provide relatively little evidence of any clear decline

in life expectancy before the second quarter of the nineteenth century. If nutritional

standards were falling as sharply as Meredith and Oxley suggest, there is little

evidence that this had any effect on mortality.

5.                        Conclusions

As this paper has demonstrated, there is a sizable gap between the conclusions which

different authors have reached regarding the amount of food which was available for

human consumption in England, or England and Wales, between circa 1700 and 1850.

Both Broadberry et al. (2011; forthcoming) and Floud et al. (2011) argued that

nutritional levels were generally quite low throughout the eighteenth and early-
                                                                                            46


nineteenth centuries, although Floud et al.’s figures were more generous, and they saw

more evidence of improvement over the period as a whole. Both Allen (2005) and

Muldrew (2011) reached much more optimistic conclusions about the amount of food

available before the mid- to late-eighteenth century, although Allen believed that food

supplies declined sharply after that point. Meredith and Oxley’s (2014) conclusions

imply that the amount of food was somewhat lower than either Allen or Muldrew

suggested, but they still see evidence of a substantial decline between the late-

eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries.

     These disparities reflect differences in both assumptions and methods. As

Meredith and Oxley (2014: 173) have pointed out, Muldrew and Floud et al. used

similar methods but reached very divergent conclusions. Broadberry et al. approached

the subject in a rather different way to Floud and his coauthors and there are

disagreements, but their results are broadly similar (at least in terms of levels, if not

trajectory). The main reasons for the disparity between Muldrew’s series and those of

other authors lie in the assumptions he makes about the amount of land under

cultivation, especially towards the end of the eighteenth century; the number of

animals producing food for human consumption; and the amount of food lost during

the production process. Many of these assumptions seem highly optimistic when

compared with the conclusions reached by other authors, and this suggests that the

truth is likely to lie somewhat closer to Floud et al. and Broadberry et al., even if

further revision of their estimates may still be necessary.

     Although there is a broad similarity between Floud et al.’s results and those of

Broadberry et al., there are also differences. As we have seen, Floud et al. have already

presented two different sets of estimates, reflecting different assumptions about

arable productivity. The corrected version of Estimate A suggests that there was a
                                                                                        47


slow but relatively consistent improvement in food availability between 1700 and 1850,

whereas the corrected version of Estimate B suggests that availability declined between

1750 and 1800. Broadberry et al.’s figures are more consistent with the latter view but

this conclusion can also be questioned. If we were to apply Floud et al.’s assessment

of the number of calories supplied by imported foods to Broadberry et al.’s domestic

figures, the overall pattern would be much closer to the corrected version of Estimate A

(see Appendix 1).

     In the meantime, it is also important to consider what these figures might say

about the overall level of nutritional adequacy. As Floud et al. (2011: 41, 77-8, 129-30,

162) pointed out, the nutritional adequacy of a diet depends not only on its size but

also its composition (and the environment in which it is consumed). Eric Schneider

(2013) has taken this argument further by applying modern theories about the

‘digestibility’ of different foods to Floud et al.’s corrected data. Although his findings

do little to alter the overall trajectory of nutritional change, they provide further

grounds for thinking that the nutritional lot of eighteenth and nineteenth century

consumers left much to be desired.

 Notes: The figures attributed to Kelly and Ó Gráda are derived from the adjustments they proposed to the estimates published by Muldrew (2011) and Broadberry et al. (2011). In relation to their estimates for 1800, Estimate A is
 reflects their amendments to Muldrew’s figures and Estimate B reflects their amendments to Broadberry et al.’s figures. When Kelly and Ó Gráda first compared their figures with those published by Broadberry et al. (Kelly and Ó Gráda
 2012: 20 [Table 4]), they included the additional calories derived from peas, beans and Irish imports under a single heading.
