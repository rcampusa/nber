                                               ABSTRACT

The importance of information asymmetries in the capital markets is commonly accepted as one of
the main reasons for home bias in investment. We posit that effects of such asymmetries may be reduced
through relationships between banks established through bank-to-bank lending and provide evidence
to support this claim. To analyze dynamics of formation of such relationships during 1980-2009 time
period, we construct a global banking network of 7938 banking institutions from 141 countries. We
find that recessions and banking crises tend to have negative effects on the formation of new connections
and that these effects are not the same for all countries or all banks. We also find that the global financial
crisis of 2008-09 had a large negative impact on the formation of new relationships in the global banking
network, especially by large banks that have been previously immune to effects of banking crises and
recessions.

1       Introduction

International ﬁnance literature has long emphasized the importance of information in international

investment, citing information asymmetry as one of the leading explanations for portfolio home

bias and lack of international diversiﬁcation.1 Financial globalization created a number of avenues

through which the eﬀects of asymmetric information can potentially be reduced. One of them is

international banking in general and lending of banks to each other in particular.2 It is commonly

accepted that bank lending to corporate borrowers establishes the relationship and produces infor-

mation ﬂows between the lender and the borrower, which in turn facilitate further lending.3 It is

thus reasonable to believe that lending of one bank to another establishes a channel for information

ﬂows between the lender and the borrower that might facilitate future lending, international capital

ﬂows of other types, as well as international trade.

        Recent global ﬁnancial crisis had a major impact on the global banking system (Milesi-Ferretti

& Tille, 2011). But did the crisis simply aﬀect the volume of bank lending or did it also aﬀect the

structure of international banking system? If relationships between banks play a role, implications

of these two developments are not identical. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to investigate the

impact of the global ﬁnancial crisis, as well as of country-speciﬁc recessions and banking crises of

the past 30 years on the formation of new relationships between banks and the importance of banks

in the aﬀected country. To achieve our goal, we use micro-level data on international syndicated

bank loans from Loan Analytics database to construct a bank-level global banking network (GBN)

    1
      A number of models of international portfolio ﬂows rely on the assumption of information asymmetry between
local and foreign markets (Brennan & Cao, 1997; Okawa & Van Wincoop, 2010). Portes et al. (2001) and Portes &
Rey (2005) provide direct evidence of the importance of information in determining bilateral patterns of aggregate
international capital ﬂows, while Kang & Stulz (1997) and Hatchondo (2008) show that such patterns are consistent
with the model that is based on asymmetric information. Local informational advantages have also been documented
in various contexts in ﬁnance literature (Ahearne et al., 2004; Bae et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008; Coval & Moscowitz,
2001; Huberman, 2001). Veldcamp & Van Nieuwerburgh (2009) present a theoretical argument for persistence of
information asymmetry.

and analyze the dynamics of its structure. This is the ﬁrst study in which bank-level network is

analyzed in a global scale.4

       We construct a global network of banks in which relationships are formed by banks extending

loans to each other, taking into account the direction of the lending. Because we are interested

in the dynamics of these network statistics, we construct two panel data sets, each at bank-year

level. One, noncumulative panel, consists of separate new networks based on loans made in each of

the years between 1980 and 2009 thus providing snapshots of lending patterns for each year. The

other, cumulative panel is constructed by adding new loans to the network that starts in 1980 and

expands through 2009, allowing us to distinguish old and new relationships. For each bank in each

year we compute the number of direct lending and borrowing connections, i.e. number of borrowers

and lenders, and identify whether the this bank in a given year played a role as a key intermediary,

that is whether it was the only bank connecting at least one pair of other banks to each other.

       To verify that relationships between banks deﬁned by lending of one bank to another have

indeed an eﬀect on lending and borrowing, we demonstrate, in a bank-level ﬁxed eﬀects regression,

that establishing a new relationship increases the amount of new loan origination to or by this

bank in the following three years. Moreover, in a country-level ﬁxed eﬀects regression, we ﬁnd that

when the number of key banks in a given country increases, that country experiences an increase in

both lending and borrowing in at least four years that follow. In a related study, Hale et al. (2011)

provide evidence that connections between banks, as deﬁned in this paper, are positively related

to international FDI and portfolio ﬂows. Finally, there is evidence that countries in which banks

were more connected to other banks through syndicated loan market experienced a lesser impact

of the global ﬁnancial crisis (Caballero et al., 2009).

       We next describe the dynamics of the overall network size and connectivity over our sample

   4
     In the existing literature, either global network is analyzed at a country level (Garratt et al., 2011; Kubelec &
Sá, 2010; Minoiu & Reyes, 2011; von Peter, 2007) or bank-level network is constructed for a speciﬁc country (Cocco
et al., 2009; Craig & von Peter, 2010).



                                                          3
period. We ﬁnd that since the 1980s the global banking network experienced two major periods

of rapid expansion — one in the early 1990s and one between 2002 and 2006. These periods of

expansion were characterized by an increasing number of banks, increasing number of connections

between banks, and increasing number of countries in which banks participate in the GBN. Im-

portantly, network expansion during these periods was achieved more through formation of new

connections by existing banks than trough an increase in the number of banks. We also observe

that formation of new connections and the share of banks that are key intermediaries tend to de-

cline during recessions in the United States. We very clearly observe a collapse of the GBN during

the global ﬁnancial crisis that brought most measures of the network back to the level that was

observed prior to the 2002-2006 expansion.

    Before turning to the regression analysis of bank-level network statistics, we present a stylized

two-country model of bank relationships that arise endogenously and respond to shocks such as

demand, supply, and cost of capital. The model predicts that local recessions in small countries

can increase the number of new connections established between the banks initially, but will lower

them in the long run. A recession in the United States (a larger country and “the world banker”)

would increase the number of new connections made because U.S. banks would seek investment

abroad. A local systemic banking crisis in a small country, represented by an increase in the cost

of funding in this country, would lead to an increase in the number of new relationships formed. A

global banking crisis, however, if thought of as a decline in the value of future relationships, would

result in fewer new connections.

    To study the eﬀects of country-speciﬁc recessions and banking crises and to control for the

eﬀects of total lending and borrowing when studying the eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis, we

turn to the regression analysis. Because we are interested in the eﬀects on new connections, we

conduct our regression analysis using the cumulative network. We ﬁnd that, conditional on total

borrowing and lending, local recessions lead to fewer new connections made by banks in the aﬀected



                                                  4
country, especially banks that are smaller or that are located in developing countries. We ﬁnd that

local banking crises have a negative eﬀect on the formation of new borrowing connections.5 During

the recessions in the U.S. large banks are more likely to ﬁnd new borrowers and establish more new

lending connections than during other times. In addition, the number of new key banks tends to

fall in countries that experience recessions.

       We ﬁnd a large negative eﬀect of the global ﬁnancial crisis on the formation of new connections,

which was felt most strongly through a decline in entry of new banks from developing countries into

the GBN and decline in the number of connections made, especially by large banks.6 We also ﬁnd

that the formation of new key banks declined and moved from developing to industrial countries

during the crisis. These eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis are conditional on total lending and

borrowing as well as on the eﬀects of local recessions that occurred in most countries in our sample

during crisis years.

       We make the following conclusions from the analysis. Recessions and as banking crises have an

important eﬀect on the development of the global banking network through lowering the number of

new connections banks make and the distribution of these connections across banks and countries.

Thus, we show that in addition to real costs of banking crises (Reinhart & Rogoﬀ, 2009; Schularick

& Taylor, 2010), there are costs associated with deterioration of bank relationships. Furthermore,

we show that the eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis on the global banking network were especially

large and unevenly distributed across banks and countries. Importantly, fewer banks during the

crisis played key intermediation roles, especially in developing countries. Combined with the ﬁnding

that new relationships and the number of key banks tend to have a persistent eﬀect on borrowing

and lending, our results provide an additional mechanism that may partly explain the collapse

in international capital ﬂows during the crisis and the fact that it was especially pronounced in

   5
    This ﬁnding is consistent with that in Peek & Rosengren (2000) for the case of Japan.
   6
    As Rose & Wieladek (2011) demonstrate, some of this decline may be due to an increase in ﬁnancial protectionism
associated with massive injections of public funds into banks during the crisis.

emerging markets (Milesi-Ferretti & Tille, 2011).7

        Our paper also has a methodological implication for the active literature on the stability of

banking network. Many recent papers on ﬁnancial networks analyze the potential for the spread

of contagion in various exogenous network structures using simulation methods (Battiston et al.,

2009; May & Arinaminpathy, 2010; Mirchev et al., 2010; Nier et al., 2007; Sachs, 2010). Others em-

pirically analyze the structure or the development of country-speciﬁc and global banking networks

(Cocco et al., 2009; Craig & von Peter, 2010; Garratt et al., 2011; von Peter, 2007). A handful of

papers model how relationships between banks form networks endogenously (Allen & Gale, 2000;

Castiglionesi & Navarro, 2007; Delli Gatti et al., 2010). The ﬁndings of our paper contribute to

this literature by showing that the structure of a global banking network responds to economic and

ﬁnancial shocks, and therefore it may not be appropriate to model banking networks as static or

exogenous, especially when analyzing the eﬀects of ﬁnancial shocks.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and methodology, mostly

focusing on the construction of the global banking network and the network statistics. Section 3

describes the evolution of the network structure over time. Section 4 presents a stylized model

of the formation of bank relationships. Section 5 presents the results of our regression analysis.

Section 6 concludes.



2       Constructing global banking network

In the wake of the global ﬁnancial crisis, the complex structure of bank relationships started to

garner attention in the literature. One direction of this analysis turned to representing banking sys-

tems as graphs, or networks.8 This literature mostly focuses on the short-run aspects of connections

    7

(2011).
   8
     Some recent papers are Chan-Lau et al. (2009); Haldane (2009) and Haldane & May (2011). The application
of the network approach to ﬁnancial markets follows recent literature on networks in social interactions and ﬁrm


                                                            6
between banks, that is, liquidity exposures of banks to one another, the topology of which aﬀects

the stability of the banking system and the propagation of the shocks. As discussed above, in this

paper we take a longer-run view of connections between banks, interpreting lending relationships

as connections that facilitate information ﬂows.

     Unlike much of the recent empirical analysis of banking and ﬁnancial networks that build

on aggregate country-level bilateral bank lending from the Bank for International Settlements

(BIS) data and bilateral asset holdings from the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Coordinated

Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) (Garratt et al., 2011; Kubelec & Sá, 2010; Minoiu & Reyes,

2011; von Peter, 2007), this paper constructs a global banking network at the bank level, something

that has not been done before.9 There are two main reasons why loan-level data are more suitable

for the construction of the network than BIS statistics. First, the BIS reports stocks of claims and

does not provide information on the origination time of these claims. The BIS computes “ﬂows”

as a change in stocks, and therefore such ﬂows include, in addition to loan origination, repayments

and changes in valuations of these stocks. As a result, such data cannot provide clean information

on the formation of new relationships between banks (or countries, in case of BIS data). Second,

country-level data do not distinguish between cases with many loans of smaller amounts made in

many diﬀerent pairs of banks and cases where only a few large loans are made between a small

number of bank pairs. Loan-level data address both of these concerns — they give the date of the

loan origination and allow us to compute network statistics at the bank level.

     We assume that each loan from bank to bank creates a relationship, or link, thus contributing

to the network. Our data consist of syndicated bank loans with median maturity of about 5 years.

theory. Karlan et al. (2009) oﬀers a theoretical model of networks in social interactions, while papers by Bottazzi
et al. (2009); Guiso et al. (2009) and Lehmann & Neuberger (2001) provide some discussion of the importance of
trust and social interactions for investment, economic exchange, and lending. The work on social capital pioneered
by Putnam (1995) is the seed of much of this literature.
   9
     Craig & von Peter (2010) use data from the German interbank market to test for tiering in the banking network;
Cocco et al. (2009) build, for the Portuguese interbank market, “borrower preference” and “lender preference” indexes
based on loans between banks, but do not go so far as to create a network of banks, which would take into account
indirect relationships.


                                                         7
Thus, the relationships we deﬁne are long-term relationships between banks. In constructing a

cumulative network panel by adding new loans to the ones that existed in the prior year we implicitly

make an assumption that relationships between banks that are established through lending persist

even if the loan is repayed.


2.1     Data sources and manipulation

Dealogic’s Loan Analytics database (a.k.a. Loanware) provides information on international syn-

dicated bank loans (with some domestic syndicated loans included as well). It has exhaustive

information on the terms of the loan, as well as some information on borrowers and lenders. From

this database, we downloaded information on loans extended between January 1, 1980, and De-

cember 31, 2009, to private- and public-sector banks, a total of 15,324 loans. Out of these, 84 loans

had to be dropped due to missing deal values and 151 had to be dropped due to missing lenders

ﬁeld, which left us with the total of 15089 loans.

       The Loan Analytics database provides information on syndicated bank loan origination, includ-

ing loans extended to ﬁnancial institutions. For our purposes, syndicated loans are a good proxy

for bank relationships because they tend to be of much longer maturities than interbank loans and

thus represent a larger commitment and the potential for information ﬂows. The bank-to-bank

syndicated loan market is relatively large — in the late 1990s syndicated bank loans extended to

banks and reported in Loan Analytics amounted to over 30 percent of total bank claims on banks

as reported by the BIS. This ratio fell to below 20 percent by the end of our sample as interbank

lending ballooned prior to the global ﬁnancial crisis. In 2007, prior to the crisis, 4.7 trillion USD

worth of syndicated loans were extended to banks (see Figure 1).10

  10
     BIS reports in its Table 10 in the Annex to Quarterly Report “total amount of syndicated loans signed,” which
is substantially smaller than what we ﬁnd in our data. This is because BIS excludes the following loans: all loans
with maturity less than three years, all loans where there is only one lender, and all loans where nationality of all
lenders is the same as that of a borrower. This excludes a large portion of the loans, especially taking into account
that BIS includes loans to nonﬁnancial institutions in its Table 10 data.



                                                         8
       We retained the following variables: name of the borrower or borrowers (327 loans had multiple

borrowers), deal nationality, all bank involvement (list of all lenders, administrators, and lead

arrangers), loan signing date, and total deal value in millions of U.S. dollars, which we deﬂate by

the seasonally adjusted U.S. consumer price index (CPI) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Since the loans are syndicated, they have on average about seven participants, with the median

of two participants. Because information on individual lender participation is only available for a

handful of the cases, we split each loan amount equally among lenders and then among borrowers, in

the case of multiple borrowers, replicating observations for each borrower-lender pair and dividing

the total deal value equally among all pairs. We then collapse our data by borrower-lender pair in

each year, adding up the amounts, so that in each year each borrower-lender pair enters only once.

       Our list of loans, thus, includes 4880 unique institutions (banks and nonbanks) as lenders only,

2535 unique banks as borrowers only, and 1110 unique banks that appear as both borrowers and

lenders, for a total of 8525 banks.11 For 7938 of the banks we were able to conﬁdently match

banks to countries.12 We link each banking entity to a country on a locational basis, treating each

subsidiary or branch as a separate entity.13


2.2     Constructing networks

To construct our noncumulative panel of network statistics, we create a separate network for each

year. To do so, for each of the 30 years covered in the data, we create a list that has only three

elements: borrower, lender, and nominal loan amount, referred to as the “edge list.” Using a

custom Mata code for Stata (Miura, 2010), we create for each year a network and compute network

  11
     While we are restricting borrower type to be a bank, for technical reasons we cannot restrict lenders to be banks.
In our data set, out of 5990 lenders (including those that also appear as borrowers), a maximum of 1710 are nonbanks,
e.g., insurance companies and special purpose vehicles.
  12
     If a given institution was associated with country X in one observation and country Y in another, we eliminate
both observations.
  13
     Mian (2006) shows that cultural and geographical distances between headquarters and local branches play an
important role.


                                                          9
statistics at the network and bank-level as described below.14 We construct for our regression

analysis a bank-year panel, heavily unbalanced, by combining each year’s network statistics for

each bank in one data set.

      For cumulative panel, we create a set of edge lists, where for each subsequent year we add

loans to those in previous years. Thus, we have edge lists including loans extended in 1980, 1980

and 1981, 1980 through 1982, etc. all the way through the full set of loans extended between 1980

and 2009. From each edge list we, once again, construct a network, but this time the network is

larger every year and the network statistics for year 𝑡 are based on the network made out of loans

between 1980 and 𝑡. We combine this information into a cumulative bank-year panel and compute

percentage changes in network statistics for each bank for each year from a previous year. The

cumulative panel contains more observations because once a bank enters the network, it stays in

the network throughout the sample.

      Note that our networks are directed, that is the direction of relationship matters, in that bank A

borrowing from bank B is not the same as bank B borrowing from bank A. For both noncumulative

and cumulative panels we also construct country-level data sets of weighted averages of network

statistics using as weights the amounts borrowed and lent by each bank, converted to U.S. dollars

using the exchange rate on the day the loan contract was signed and deﬂated by the monthly U.S.

2.3    Network statistics

Some terminology needs to be introduced to describe precisely the network statistics used in this

paper. The vertices (nodes) of the network, banks in our case, are indexed by 𝑖 = 1, ..., 𝐼. The

edges (direct connections) between each pair of nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗, loans in our case, are denoted by 𝑐𝑖𝑗 ,

  14
     We check our computations, when possible, against MatlabBGL version 4.0, which makes use of the Boost Graph
Library.
  15
     Detailed information at the country-year level is available in the Electronic Appendix.


                                                      10
which is binary {0, 1}. Not every pair of nodes is connected by edges. The edges carry the weights

which measure the intensity of the connection, or loan amount, which we denote as 𝑤𝑖𝑗 . Note that

𝑤𝑖𝑗 > 0 if 𝑐𝑖𝑗 = 1 and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 = 0 if 𝑐𝑖𝑗 = 0. The edges are directed so that 𝑐𝑖𝑗 ∕= 𝑐𝑗𝑖 and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∕= 𝑤𝑗𝑖 .

We will denote 𝑐𝑖𝑗 and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 as connections going from node 𝑖 to node 𝑗, i.e. a loan from bank 𝑖 to

bank 𝑗.

    A path between each pair of nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗 is a sequence of edges that connect 𝑖 to 𝑗. There

could be many paths connecting each pair of nodes and, because the network is directed, paths

from 𝑖 to 𝑗 do not generally coincide with paths from 𝑗 to 𝑖. For our purposes, the length of a path

is the number of edges that comprise that path regardless of the weight; the weight is only used

later when we aggregate network statistics across banks. A geodesic path is a path between two

given nodes that has the shortest possible length. We denote the length of the geodesic path from

node 𝑖 to node 𝑗 as 𝑔𝑖𝑗 . Note that each pair of nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗 can have more than one geodesic path

which will, by deﬁnition, have the same length. Because the network is directed, there are pairs

of nodes for which there is a path in one direction but not in the other. We denote the number

of geodesic paths from 𝑖 to 𝑗 as 𝑝𝑖𝑗 . We denote the number of geodesic paths that go from 𝑖 to 𝑗

through 𝑘 as 𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑗 .

    We ﬁrst construct the statistics that describe the network as a whole

                                                                                       ∑ ∑
   ∙ Density is the number of edges as a share of possible number of edges:               𝑖   𝑗 (𝑐𝑖𝑗   +

      𝑐𝑗𝑖 )/(𝑁 (𝑁 − 1)). Density is ∈ [0; 1] and describes how connected the nodes are within the

      network, it is sometimes referred to as connectivity or connectedness of a network;

   ∙ Diameter is the length of the longest geodesic path in the network: max𝑖𝑗 𝑔𝑖𝑗 . It measures

      the span of the network;


    We next calculate the following measures for each node:

                                                                     ∑
   ∙ OutDegree is the number of edges originating from node 𝑖:         𝑖 𝑐𝑖𝑗 ;


                                                 11

      ∙ InDegree is the number of edges terminating in node 𝑖:                   𝑖 𝑐𝑗𝑖 ;


      ∙ Betweenness is the average ratio of geodesic paths between any pair 𝑗 and 𝑘 that go through
                                                                      ∑ ∑
        node 𝑖 to the total number of geodesic paths between 𝑗 and 𝑘: 𝑗 𝑘 (𝑝𝑗𝑖𝑘 /𝑝𝑗𝑘 ).

       In- and outdegree statistics measure how many direct connections each bank has in terms

of borrowing and lending, respectively, that is how many lenders and borrowers each bank has.

Betweenness measures how central the bank is in terms of intermediating bank ﬂows. We deﬁne

a Key bank as bank that has positive betweenness. To identify newly formed relationships and

changes in a bank’s status as a key bank, we simply take ﬁrst diﬀerences in these variables in the

cumulative network.

       Table 1 shows that these statistics are important measures of connections between banks in

terms of bank lending. In columns (1) and (2) we present the results of the estimation of bank ﬁxed

eﬀects regression of borrowing and lending, respectively, on contemporaneous and lagged indicators

of whether a bank has established a new borrowing or lending connection. Since all the information

in our data is based on the loan origination, an increase in borrowing or lending in a given year

is entirely due to a new loan facility and is not automatically related to the loan that was made

when connection was established initially in prior years. We ﬁnd that adding a new lender increases

bank’s borrowing through new loan origination in the following three years, while adding a new

borrower increases bank’s lending through new loan origination in the following two years. We ﬁnd

that becoming a key bank does not substantially aﬀect that bank’s future lending or borrowing.16

       In columns (3) and (4) we present the results of the country ﬁxed eﬀects regression of country

total borrowing and lending on contemporaneous and lagged number of key banks in that country.

Once again, in each year borrowing and lending reﬂects only new loan origination. We ﬁnd that an

increase in the number of key banks in a country leads to a persistent increase in both borrowing

and lending amount by this country. In contrast to the eﬀects on individual banks, average number
 16
      Controlling for the key bank status in these regressions does not alter the results.


                                                            12
of new borrowing and lending connections in a country does not have an eﬀect on future borrowing

and lending by this country.17


2.4    Recessions and banking crises

To identify years with recessions in the U.S., we use NBER recession dates. To identify local

recessions we use data on real GDP growth from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS)

(line 99b) with missing observations ﬁlled in with World Economic Outlook (WEO) data if available.

Since IFS does not report the data for Iceland and Taiwan, we take these series entirely from WEO.

We construct the indicator of local recessions as equal to one whenever the GDP growth rate is

below its linear trend, which is a broader deﬁnition than is commonly used but a transparent one

and feasible to compute for most countries.18

      Dates of systemic banking crises are taken directly from Laeven & Valencia (2008), which

means that 2008 and 2009 are not coded as banking crises in any country. This is not a problem,

however, because in all regressions we will include dummy variables for 2008 and 2009. In the

regression analysis we lag recession indicators and a banking crisis indicator by one year.19



3     Evolution of the global banking network

We begin our analysis informally, by plotting measures of the network size and connectivity for

each year for cumulative and noncumulative networks over time to see any trends and the eﬀects

of U.S. recessions and of the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008-2009. Figure 2 presents measure of the

size of the network, while Figure 3 presents measures of connectivity.

  17
     Controlling for the average number of new lenders or borrowers in a country does not aﬀect the results of these
regressions.
  18
     For the US, 1995, 2002, and 2007 are classiﬁed as recession years by our deﬁnition, in addition to all the years
identiﬁed as recession years by NBER.
  19
     Electronic Appendix provides complete data on recessions and banking crises in our sample.


                                                         13
       The top panel of Figure 2 plots as a line the number of banks that either borrowed or lent,

or both, in each year in our sample, based on noncumulative network panel, and as bars a number

of new banks that entered the GBN in each year, based on cumulative network panel. We can see

that bank entry slowed down in the decade prior to the global ﬁnancial crisis. We can also see the

decline in the total number of banks after 1997, partly driven by a wave of banks’ mergers and

acquisitions.20

       The middle panel of Figure 2 plots the total number of connections between banks in each

year, and the number of new connections. We can see that until the mid-1990s most connections

in the network were due to new connections made rather than connections between banks that

have interacted with each other in the past. The share of new connections declined in the decade

prior to the global ﬁnancial crisis. We can also see a very pronounced drop in connections between

banks during the crisis, both in terms of total number of connections and in terms of number of

new connections formed.

       The bottom panel of Figure 2 demonstrate that despite the decline in the total number of

banks in the network in recent years, country representation continued to grow with banks from new

countries entering the GBN and more and more countries participating in the syndicated lending

activity in each year. In the largest network we constructed, cumulative network as of 2009, there

are banks from 141 countries. Most of this growth in the number of countries is accounted for by

the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and by the entry of the African and Central

American nations into global capital markets.

       All three panels of Figure 2 show quite clearly two periods of rapid expansion of the GBN.

First occurred in the early 1990s and the second in the ﬁrst six years of this century. These two

episodes are frequently characterized as lending booms in the literature. Here we show that not

only the volume of lending grew rapidly during these periods, but also lending and borrowing was

 20
      In the U.S. the wave of bank mergers was precipitated by Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 (Pilloﬀ, 2004).



                                                         14
conducted by more and more banks to and from more and more new counterparties. The latter

is demonstrated by a growing number of new connections during these periods, which, as we have

argued in the previous section, in itself has likely contributed to increasing globalization of capital

ﬂows and volume of lending activity.

    Figure 3 describes the dynamics of network connectivity. We observe an increase in the density

of the network, that is more connections on average per bank during the period when the number

of banks was rapidly declining. The smooth decline of the density of cumulative network is simply

driven by the network expansion over time. We can also observe that not only new connections were

made in the network throughout our sample period, but that the span of the network increased to

reach 18 at its peak in 2007. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, however, the network has shrunk —

the only way this can be observed in the cumulative network is when new direct connections are

made between banks that were previously connected through a longer chain.

    We deﬁned a key intermediary, or a key bank, as a bank that acts as the only connection

between at least one pair of other banks. While we can see an overall trend increase in the number

of key banks in the network as a share of total number of banks, this trend is partly driven by the

declining number of banks in the network. We can see that the number of new banks that act as

key intermediaries is very small after 1990. In fact, less than 1 percent of new banks in the network

in each year are key banks. In addition, we see a rapid increase in the number of key banks in the

years just prior to the global ﬁnancial crisis, reaching over 10 percent at its peak in 2007 prior to

its collapse to just 6 percent during the crisis. As we saw in the previous section, the number of

key banks in a given country is positively associated with borrowing and lending in the subsequent

years, meaning that the structure of the GBN was likely amplifying the global credit cycle.

    The ﬁnal chart on Figure 4 shows the average number of direct links banks in the network have

and the number of new links they make every year. Ivashina & Scharfstein (2010) demonstrated for

the sample of U.S. syndicated loans to corporations that the number of lenders in a given syndicate


                                                  15
decline during the global ﬁnancial crisis. We see this decline in our sample as well — the median

number of participants in a syndicate fell from 4 to 2 between 2007 and 2009. By construction,

this would result in the decline in the average number of direct connections in the GBN. We see,

however, that the decline in the number of connections during the crisis was larger than what can

be accounted by the changing syndicate size. More importantly, very few new connections were

made, and in 2009 the average number of connections in the cumulative network actually declined,

which can only be due to the composition eﬀect — new banks that entered the GBN in 2009 entered

with fewer connections than existing banks had on average.

    All charts in Figures 2 and 3 show shading for U.S. recessions. We can see that during U.S.

recessions the number of connections and especially the number of new connections in the GBN

tend to decline. This is evident on the middle panel of Figure 2 and the SE panel of Figure 3. We

can also see that the diameter of the network is smaller during U.S. recessions and that the number

of key intermediaries tends to fall. We can see very prominently that there are almost no new key

banks and no new connections made during U.S. recessions. These observations, however, can be

driven by overall decline in bank lending activity and not really reﬂecting the structural changes in

the network. For this reason, we will analyze the eﬀects of U.S. recessions and the global ﬁnancial

crisis on formation of new relationships and on the number of key banks in the regression setting,

which allows us to condition on total borrowing and lending, time trend, as well as country and

bank ﬁxed eﬀects.



4    A simple model of bank relationships

Before turning to the regression analysis, to ﬁx ideas on how macroeconomic shocks can aﬀect bank

relationships, we present a stylized model of bank relationship formation. It takes the macroecon-

omy as given but allows international bank relationships to form endogenously. In our model

banks have to establish relationships with banks in a foreign country in order to ﬁnance foreign

                                                 16
projects — our short-cut for the idea that banks facilitate capital ﬂows between countries through

intermediation or otherwise.


4.1    Model setup with no relationships, one period

Suppose the world consists of two countries, home and foreign. We denote variables pertaining

to the foreign country with ∗ . In each country, banks ﬁnance investment projects, which have

heterogeneous returns 𝑅. We assume that banks can perfectly select projects with the highest

available return and therefore the return on the marginal project ﬁnanced is a declining function

of the number of projects ﬁnanced: 𝑅′ (𝑥) < 0, 𝑅′′ (𝑥) > 0, where 𝑥 is the number of projects

ﬁnanced. We allow this function to be diﬀerent in the foreign country, but have the same properties:

𝑅∗ ′ (𝑥) < 0, 𝑅∗ ′′ (𝑥) > 0. We assume that projects succeed with probability 𝜋, and otherwise fail

with zero return. We assume that the probability of success is the same in both countries but varies

by the state of nature — it can be either high 𝜋𝐻 with probability 1 − 𝜌 or low 𝜋𝐿 with probability

𝜌. We interpret the state of nature with a low probability of success as recession, and 𝜌 as recession

probability. Thus, the expected return on marginal project 𝑥 is ((1 − 𝜌)𝜋𝐻 + 𝜌𝜋𝐿 )𝑅(𝑥) = 𝜙𝑅(𝑥),

where 𝜙 = (1 − 𝜌)𝜋𝐻 + 𝜌𝜋𝐿 .

      There are 𝑁 and 𝑁 ∗ identical risk-neutral banks in domestic and foreign countries that face

exogenous costs of funding: 𝐷 and 𝐷∗ , respectively. They decide whether to invest in domestic

projects, foreign projects, or not to invest at all. Each bank can only ﬁnance one project. In

order to invest in a project in a diﬀerent country, a bank has to pay a fee 𝐹 to a bank in that

country for intermediation. For simplicity, we assume that banks either invest in projects or serve

as intermediaries. Since banks that intermediate do not invest their own money, they don’t have

to pay costs of funding. Thus, we also assume that the cost of intermediation is zero and that

the only cost associated with intermediation is an opportunity cost of not being able to ﬁnance a

domestic project. Banks that choose to invest in foreign projects have to pay an intermediation fee


                                                 17
in addition to the cost of funding prior to realization of the return on the project. We denote as

𝛼, 𝛼∗ the share of banks that ﬁnance domestic projects.


Autarky.    Suppose 𝑁 and 𝑁 ∗ are suﬃciently large so that 𝜙𝑅(𝑁 ) < 𝐷 and 𝜙𝑅∗ (𝑁 ∗ ) < 𝐷∗ .

Because of an additional fee required to ﬁnance foreign projects, in this case 𝛼 and 𝛼∗ solve

𝜙𝑅(𝛼𝑁 ) = 𝐷 and 𝜙𝑅∗ (𝛼∗ 𝑁 ∗ ) = 𝐷∗ . This is a market equilibrium as well as the social optimum

because only projects with positive expected net returns are ﬁnanced and all of such projects are

ﬁnanced at a minimum cost. We abstract from the question of which banks do and which do not

end up ﬁnancing projects. One can think of either random or sequential assignment, it does not

aﬀect the predictions of the model.


Foreign ﬁnancing.      In order to construct an equilibrium in which foreign ﬁnancing is present,

we simply assume that the foreign country does not have a suﬃcient number of banks, so that

even if all banks engage in ﬁnancing, the marginal project will still have a positive expected net

return, that is 𝜙𝑅∗ (𝛼∗ 𝑁 ∗ ) > 𝐷∗ . One can interpret this assumption in a number of ways: as

representing an underdeveloped ﬁnancial system in foreign country; as representing a lower level of

economic development in a foreign country, and thus higher return on investment; as a lower level

of savings, for institutional or other reasons, which limits the amount of domestic funds available

for investment.

    In the home country all projects with positive net expected returns will be ﬁnanced by home

banks, so that 𝛼 is still given by 𝜙𝑅(𝛼𝑁 ) = 𝐷. For the marginal bank to be indiﬀerent between

ﬁnancing a domestic or a foreign project, the expected return on the foreign project should be

equal to the expected return on the home project. These returns will be zero unless there is still

a positive net return on foreign projects after all interested home and foreign banks have chosen

to invest in them — this case is less interesting, so we assume 𝑁 is suﬃciently large to rule it

out. Given that 𝛼 is the share of home banks investing in domestic projects, denote as 𝛿(1 − 𝛼)


                                                18
the share of all domestic banks that choose to invest in foreign projects. This gives us demand for

intermediation.

      Foreign banks have a choice between ﬁnancing their domestic projects or intermediating. We

assume that all foreign banks that do not invest in domestic projects have an equal chance of

intermediating, which they take as given. Thus, in equilibrium foreign banks will be indiﬀerent

between the expected returns from investing in their domestic projects and the expected fees from

participating in the intermediation lottery. Thus, supply of intermediation is jointly determined

with ﬁnancing of foreign projects by foreign banks.

      The total number of home projects ﬁnanced will still be 𝛼𝑁 , while the total number of foreign

projects ﬁnanced will be 𝛼∗ 𝑁 ∗ + 𝛿(1 − 𝛼)𝑁 . The equilibrium is thus a triplet (𝛼, 𝛼∗ , 𝛿) that solves

the following equations

                                            𝜙𝑅(𝛼𝑁 ) = 𝐷,                                           (1)


                                 𝜙𝑅∗ (𝛼∗ 𝑁 ∗ + 𝛿(1 − 𝛼)𝑁 ) = 𝐹 + 𝐷,                                (2)

                           𝛿(1 − 𝛼)𝑁
                                        𝐹 = 𝜙𝑅∗ (𝛼∗ 𝑁 ∗ + 𝛿(1 − 𝛼)𝑁 ) − 𝐷∗ .                       (3)
                           (1 − 𝛼∗ )𝑁 ∗


4.2    Many periods and formation of relationships

To introduce the value of relationships, we need to extend the benchmark model to include multiple

periods. To keep the model simple, we will assume that banks that experience a bad realization

of the project they ﬁnance simply exit and are replaced by the same number of banks that are

identical to those remaining. This way, the number of banks in each country remains constant and

we don’t have to keep track of each bank’s status. The only thing that will be carried from one

period to the next is relationships established through intermediation.

      For the value of the relationship to be positive, we will assume that the cost of intermediation

for banks that have already been engaged in the ﬁnancing of foreign projects is smaller than the cost


                                                  19
of intermediation for banks that are entering the market of ﬁnancing foreign projects. In particular,

we will keep the intermediation fee for new entrants at 𝐹 and will assume that banks that have

already established a relationship will only pay 𝑓 < 𝐹 in each of the periods when they choose to

ﬁnance foreign projects. We will make a slight change for the purpose of model interpretation by

allowing 𝜙 in the home country to be diﬀerent from 𝜙∗ in the foreign country.

    We consider an equilibrium with an interior solution, as above, in each period. Period 𝑡 will

start with 𝛾𝑡 𝑁 banks in the home country that have ﬁnanced foreign projects in period 𝑡 − 1;

𝛾 represents the share of home banks that have established relationships with foreign banks in

previous periods. These banks have a lower cost of ﬁnancing foreign projects in period 𝑡 than

other banks and we assume that they will always choose to ﬁnance foreign projects. Thus, 𝛾𝑡 =
 ∗ (𝛾                                 ∗
𝜋𝑡−1  𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝑡−1 (1 − 𝛾𝑡−1 )), where 𝜋𝑡−1 is the realization of project success probability in the foreign

country in period 𝑡 − 1 and is therefore the probability that a bank that established relationships

in period 𝑡 − 1 will survive in period 𝑡, 𝛾𝑡−1 is the share of banks that already had relationships at

the start of period 𝑡 − 1, 𝛿𝑡−1 is the share of banks that neither had prior relationships nor were

ﬁnancing domestic projects that chose to ﬁnance foreign projects in 𝑡 − 1 (and pay the fee 𝐹 ). In

each period, therefore, 𝛾 is predetermined. Since all time periods are a priori identical, we will

drop the time subscript.

    There is now an additional value to ﬁnancing foreign projects — the value of relationships that

will with probability 𝜙∗ bring rents next period and in every following period 𝑠 with probability 𝜙∗𝑠

in the amount of 𝐹 − 𝑓 . This implies the present value of the relationship, 𝑉𝑡 = ∞
                                                                                   ∑
                                                                                     𝑠=𝑡+1 (𝐹 − 𝑓 ) =
 𝜙∗
1−𝜙∗ (𝐹   − 𝑓 ) ∀𝑡.

    In the benchmark model, the zero-proﬁt condition for the home banks makes the number of new

connections independent of home economic conditions — whenever 𝛼 changes to satisfy equation

(1), 𝛿 adjusts accordingly. Since we are interested in the eﬀects of home economic conditions on

bank relationship, we make another modiﬁcation to our benchmark mode here, assuming that


                                                   20
                                                                        ¯ in the case of success,
regardless of the number of home projects ﬁnanced they pay ﬁxed returns 𝑅
                                             ¯ We assume that 𝑅
thus expected return on the home project is 𝜙𝑅.               ¯ is suﬃciently small so that

a) home banks with existing relationships still prefer to invest in foreign projects, and b) foreign

banks are still not interested in investing in home projects. The choice of 𝛼 is now irrelevant —

share 𝛿 of banks that don’t have relationship will invest in foreign projects, the rest of them will

invest in home projects.

    In equilibrium with an interior solution, home banks without relationships will be indiﬀerent

between ﬁnancing domestic projects or foreign projects. Foreign banks with relationships will

collect a smaller intermediation fee than banks that provide intermediation for new foreign projects

ﬁnancing banks. To make the model interesting and keep it simple, we will assume that foreign

relationship banks all engage in ﬁnancing of their domestic projects in addition to collecting the

fee of 𝑓 . This assumption represents a possibility that maintaining relationships is less costly for

the intermediary than establishing new ones, and thus there is no opportunity cost of maintaining

existing relationships.

    As before, remaining 𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 foreign banks are indiﬀerent between ﬁnancing their domestic

project and entering the lottery for intermediation of new foreign investments by home banks, given

that 𝛾𝑁 domestic projects are already taken by relationship banks. Share 𝛼∗ of these remaining

banks will ﬁnance projects, while the rest will enter the lottery. Denote the number of new con-

nections formed as a share of 𝑁 , 𝜈 = 𝛿(1 − 𝛾). Then the total number of foreign projects ﬁnanced

will be 𝛾𝑁 + 𝛼∗ (𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 ) + (𝛾 + 𝜈)𝑁 . The equilibrium for each period is thus a pair (𝛼∗ , 𝜈) that

solves the following equations given 𝛾


                                       𝜙∗ 𝑅∗ (Ψ) + 𝑉 = 𝐹 + 𝜙𝑅,
                                                            ¯                                    (4)


                                        𝜈𝑁
                                                         𝐹 = 𝜙∗ 𝑅∗ (Ψ) − 𝐷∗ ,                    (5)
                              (1 −   𝛼∗ )(𝑁 ∗   − 𝛾𝑁 )

where Ψ = 𝛼∗ (𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 ) + (2𝛾 + 𝜈)𝑁 is the total number of projects in the foreign country that

are ﬁnanced by all banks.

                                                                        ¯ − 𝐷∗ > 𝑉 and presents
    The Appendix shows that this equilibrium will be stable as long as 𝜙𝑅

the conditions that need to hold for the solution to be in the interior, that is 0 < 𝛼∗ < 1, 0 < 𝜈 < 1.

It also presents all the derivatives used for comparative statics below.

    An expected equilibrium path can be computed using the fact that in expectation 𝛾 should

be the same in all periods. Thus an expected equilibrium path is values of (𝛼∗ , 𝜈, 𝛾) that solve

equations (4)-(5) and

                                 𝛾 = 𝜙∗ (𝛾 + 𝛿(1 − 𝛼 − 𝛾)) = 𝜙(𝛾 + 𝜈).                             (6)


We will interpret changes to one-period equilibrium described by equations (4)-(5) as short-run

eﬀects and changes to the expected equilibrium path as long-run eﬀects.


4.2.1     Interpretation and comparative statics


We will now consider the interpretation of our model and the implications of parameter changes

for the expected equilibrium path as well as for each period’s equilibrium. As we are interested in

banking crises and business cycles, we consider the eﬀects of the following perturbations:


Recession-demand: a bad state of nature (realization 𝜋 = 𝜋𝐿 ) could be thought of as a recession

        that is due to an adverse demand shock, as fewer projects are successful. The only eﬀect of

        such a shock in a foreign country will be to lower 𝛾 in the beginning of the period. We can

        also think of a permanent adverse demand shock that would increase 𝜌, a probability of the

        bad state of nature, and thus lower 𝜙 in case of the home country and 𝜙∗ in case of the foreign

        country.

Recession-supply: we can model a supply-side recession as a decline in returns on projects for

        any given number of projects ﬁnanced, that is, decline in 𝑅(⋅) or 𝑅∗ (⋅).

                                                   22
Cost of funding: we can think of an increase in the cost of funding 𝐷 and 𝐷∗ as banking crises

     in home and foreign countries, respectively.

Intermediation fees: we can think of a global banking crisis as an increase in the costs of inter-

     mediation, especially in the cost of establishing new connections, 𝐹 , which can be interpreted

     as an increased counterparty risk premium, although we do not model such risk speciﬁcally.

     An increase in 𝑓 for a given 𝐹 can be thought of as a decreased value of relationships for

     lenders, which could also be an outcome of a crisis in banks’ conﬁdence.


The Appendix shows formally the eﬀects of these perturbations on the number of new connections

formed, 𝜈. Here we provide an informal discussion and intuition of the results.

    A temporary adverse demand shock in the foreign country would lead to a larger than usual

destruction of existing relationships, both in home and in foreign countries. As a result, more

new connections will be made in the following period. A permanent adverse demand shock in the

foreign country, that is, a lower average probability of project success, would lead to a decline in

the number of new connections made, both in the short and, to a lesser extent, in the long run. A

permanent adverse supply shock in the foreign country, that is, a lower return on projects for any

given number of projects ﬁnanced, would lead to a decline in the number of new connections made

both in the short and the long run.

    Overall, the model predicts that while a temporary demand shock would lead to an increase

in the number of new connections, recessions that are more long-lasting, regardless whether they

are demand- or supply-driven, will result in the reduction of the number of new connections. The

intuition from this result is as follows — temporary shocks may destroy existing connections that

need to be replaced, giving a temporary boost to the number of new connections made. In the

long run, however, a reduction in proﬁtability of investing in the foreign country is more important,

reducing the incentive for home banks to form new connections.



                                                 23
    Permanent adverse demand or supply shocks in the home country increase the number of new

connections formed as more home banks turn to ﬁnancing foreign projects due to a now lower

opportunity cost of not investing in home projects.

    A local banking crisis exhibited as an increase in the cost of funding in the foreign country will

give comparative advantage to home banks and therefore lead to an increase in the number of new

connections formed. While in our benchmark model an increase in the cost of funding in the home

country would lower the number of new connections formed by giving comparative advantage to

foreign banks, in this set-up home banks incur the same cost of investing in home and in foreign

projects and therefore this cost has no eﬀect on the number of new connections.

    An increase in the cost of intermediation holding the value of relationship constant has an

ambiguous eﬀect on a number of connections formed. This result comes from the fact that home

banks are discouraged from forming new connections by the higher intermediation fee, while at the

same time the intermediation fee is received by foreign banks as pure rent and thus an increase in

this fee reduces the number of foreign banks that are willing to ﬁnance their domestic projects. For

the resulting eﬀect to decrease the number of new connections formed we would need to assume

that return on foreign projects declines quickly with an increase in the number of projects ﬁnanced,

so that the eﬀect on home banks dominates. A decline in the value of the relationship holding the

intermediation fee constant would lead to fewer new connections made, quite intuitively.

    Translating these ﬁndings to empirical terms, we interpret the home country as the U.S., or a

core country in the global banking network. We ﬁnd that local recessions in countries other than

U.S. are likely to increase the number of new relationships established by banks initially, but then

lower it as lost connections are replaced. A recession in the U.S. would increase the number of new

connections made by U.S. banks. A local banking crisis that results in a higher cost of funding for

banks would lead to an increase in the number of new relationships formed. In case of a global

banking crisis, which we could think of as a destruction of trust between banks that lowers the


                                                 24
value of relationships, fewer new connections will be made.

    The above model does not create a network of relationships, but it is clear that it could be

extended to include more countries. Diﬀerences in the returns to projects, in costs of funding, as

well as the wedge that arises from intermediation fees would allow for a given country’s banks to

receive foreign investment from a country with more banks while at the same time investing in the

country with fewer banks. Consistent with ﬁndings in the literature that banking networks tend

to have a core-periphery structure, we would obtain a network with countries that only receive

funding on the periphery and countries that receive funding and also fund foreign projects in the

core. All of the intuition obtained in the two-country model could readily be extended to such a

network.



5    Regression analysis

We analyze the formation of new connections in a regression setting. Because we are interested in

the incremental eﬀects of recessions and crises on the structure of the global banking network, we

conduct our regression analysis on the bases of cumulative network panel, where we look at ﬁrst

diﬀerences of the network characteristics.

    We begin by a simple time series analysis where we do not distinguish between countries and

analyze the eﬀects of recessions and crises on the global banking network as a whole. Next we

turn to country-level analysis, where we study how recessions and banking crises in a given country

aﬀect new connections formed by this country’s banks and the number of key banks in that country.

In these regressions we control for country ﬁxed eﬀects and split our sample into industrial and

developing countries. Finally, we conduct a bank-level analysis, with bank ﬁxed eﬀects, where we

study how the probability of a new connection by an individual bank, the probability that bank

becomes a key bank, and the number of new connections it form is aﬀected by banking crises and



                                                25
recessions. For all regressions conducted at the bank level we clustering standard errors on country

to avoid downward bias (Moulton, 1990). The results are reported in Tables 2 through 4.

       Even though our full network consists of 141 countries and 7938 banks, we don’t want oﬀshore

ﬁnancial centers and countries with only a few banks to aﬀect our analysis. While all the network

characteristics are computed using the full sample, in the regression analysis we only retain countries

that are not classiﬁed as oﬀshore ﬁnancial centers in Rose & Spiegel (2007) and that had at least 90

observations in our data (that is, on average at least 3 banks per year in 30 years in the cumulative

network).21


5.1      Time-series regressions

The top panel of Table 2 presents the results of our time series regressions. We are considering

the dynamics of four variables — number of new banks in the GBN, average number of new

lenders (i.e. new borrowing connections) each bank has, average number of new borrowers (i.e.

new lending connections) each bank has, and the number of new key banks in the network. In

network lingo, these correspond to the change in the number of nodes, change in average indegree,

change in average outdegree, and the number of nodes with positive betweenness that either had

zero betweenness or did not exist in the previous year, all computed based on cumulative network

panel. We compute these numbers for the network as a whole and thus we have one observation

per year.

       We estimate an OLS regression for each of these variables, computing robust standard errors

to allow for heteroschedasticity. Because the number of new keybanks is rather small, especially

once we move to the country-level regressions, we also estimate a count regression, using negative

binomial (NB) speciﬁcation for the number of new key borrowers. The interpretation of coeﬃcients

is diﬀerent, but as comparison of columns (4) and (5) of Table 2 reveals, qualitatively the results are

 21
      List of countries in our regression sample is provided in the Electronic Appendix.


                                                          26
the same. In this time series speciﬁcation we cannot reject a simpler version of the count model, a

Poisson regression, but as we move on to other speciﬁcation, we deﬁnitely observe over-dispersion,

which explains our choice of the NB model.22

     In all regressions we control for change in total borrowing. In aggregating the full network it

has to be equal to total lending by construction. Since we excluded some of the countries from the

regression analysis, it is not identically equal, but very closely correlated. As we can see, change in

total borrowing only enters signiﬁcantly in the regressions with the change in number of banks or

change in number of key banks as a dependent variable. Since the number of new lenders and of

new borrowers is the average number per bank, it is invariant with respect to the overall lending

in the network.

     We also control for linear trend. This may potentially raise a concern with respect to our

estimates of the eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis. Indeed, given that the crisis is at the very end

of our sample period, a positive trend would exaggerate the decline during crisis. As it turns out,

however, in all regressions the estimated slope of the trend line is negative thus potentially biasing

down the eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis. If we re-estimate the regressions without including

trend, we ﬁnd very large and strongly signiﬁcant coeﬃcients on 2008 and 2009 in all regressions.

We choose to be conservative in our approach and proceed to include trend in all our regressions

as a benchmark.23

     Given only 29 observations in the regression, we do not have much power to estimate the eﬀects

precisely. We do see, however, patterns consistent with the predictions of our model. Following

U.S. recessions there is more new connections in terms of both borrowing (new lenders) and lending

(new borrowers), while a larger number of local recessions and banking crises are associated with

fewer new connections made in the subsequent year. In fact, the decline in the average number of
  22
     Estimating this same regression imposing Poisson distribution does not aﬀect the results. It allows, however, to
compute pseudo-𝑅2 , which in this case is equal to 0.35.
  23
     Including quadratic trend instead produces results very similar to those with linear trend and estimates of the
coeﬃcient on the quadratic that are very close to zero.


                                                         27
borrowers is statistically signiﬁcant. We also observe a decline in the number of key banks in the

network in the aftermath of all events, and a particularly large and strongly statistically signiﬁcant

decline in 2008. According to linear speciﬁcation, the decline in the number of key banks in 2008

was 18, more than one standard deviation (13), while according to marginal eﬀects of the NB

regression, the number of key banks in 2008 was 54 percent smaller than on average in the sample

(the incidence rate ratio corresponding to this coeﬃcient is 0.46).

      The eﬀect of the U.S. recessions on the formation of new connections, while consistent with

the model prediction, seems to be at odds with our informal analysis of Figures 2 and 3. This

results arises from the fact that in the regressions we now condition on trend as well as recessions

and banking crises in other countries, all of which have a negative impact on the number of new

connections. Other results are consistent with our graphical analysis.


5.2    Country-level regressions

Bottom panel of Table 2 presents the analysis of the same set of variables in the country panel. Now

all variables are computed as sums or averages for each country in each year. Since borrowing is no

longer identical to lending, we include both change in lending and change in borrowing as controls

(the correlation between change in lending and change in borrowing in this sample is 0.54). As

we expect an increase in borrowing is associated with larger number of new borrowing connections

(number new lenders), while the increase in lending turns out to not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the number

of new lending connections (number of new borrowers). We continue to include linear trend and

now we also include country ﬁxed eﬀects.24 In these regressions we have 72 countries for 29 years,

an almost balanced panel with 1980 observations.

      We ﬁnd that local recessions lead to fewer new banks participating in the GBN. Both recessions

  24
     Including instead time ﬁxed eﬀects precludes us from identifying eﬀects of U.S. recessions and the global ﬁnancial
crisis. This alternative speciﬁcation, however, strengthens our results with respect to local recessions and banking
crises.


                                                          28
and banking crises are associated with smaller average number of new lenders for the banks in the

aﬀected country — this is not surprising. While existing lenders are unlikely to exit during the

crisis because they may not be interested in cashing in their losses, new investors are unlikely to

enter a country immediately after a recession or a banking crisis. We also observe a large decline in

the number of key banks overall in the aftermath of U.S. recessions, as well as an additional decline

in the number of key banks in countries aﬀected by local recessions. During the global ﬁnancial

crisis the number of key banks dropped in 2008, while in 2009 we observe a smaller number of

borrowers per bank.

    We repeat this country-level analysis separately for industrial and for developing countries and

present the results in Table 3. The speciﬁcation is identical to that of the bottom panel of Table

2. The top panel shows the results for 23 high income OECD countries, while the bottom panel

presents the results for the remaining 49 countries in our regression sample.

    We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant eﬀects of recessions or crises on the new connections made by banks

in the industrial countries. The only exception is a statistically signiﬁcant decline in the average

number of new borrowers of banks located in countries that experienced a banking crisis in the

preceding year. We ﬁnd a substantial decline in the number of key banks in industrial countries in

the aftermath of U.S. recessions. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd an increase in the number of key banks in

industrial countries in 2009.

    This indicates that our full sample results are likely to be driven by the banks from developing

countries. Indeed, we ﬁnd, as shown in the bottom panel of Table 3, local recessions and banking

crises tend to lower the number of banks in these countries that enter the GBN and lower the number

of new lenders of banks in the aﬀected countries. We also observe a substantial and statistically

signiﬁcant decline in the number of banks entering the GBN during the global ﬁnancial crisis.

Local recessions and the global ﬁnancial crisis are also associated with a reduction in the number

of key banks in developing countries. Combined with the previous observation of an increase in


                                                 29
the number of key banks in the industrial countries in 2009, this shows that global ﬁnancial crisis

moved the network center from developing to industrial countries.

      Overall these results suggest that in the past 30 years network positions of banks in industrial

countries have been quite resilient to the eﬀects of recessions and banking crises, which cannot

be said of banks in developing countries. Similarly, banks in the developing countries experienced

more strongly the eﬀects of the global ﬁnancial crisis, which is consistent with a larger decline in

international capital ﬂows to and from these countries as documented in Milesi-Ferretti & Tille

(2011).


5.3    Bank-level regressions

Finally we turn to bank-level regressions where we study the eﬀects of recessions and banking

crises on the individual bank’s probability of establishing a connection with a new lender or a new

borrower or of becoming a key bank. We also investigate, conditional on establishing at least one

new borrowing or lending connection, the eﬀect of recessions and banking crises on the number of

new connections made. The results are reported in Table 4. First three columns present the results

of the linear probability model regressions of the probability of a new lender, new borrower, or

becoming a key bank, while last two columns present negative binomial regressions for the number

of new borrowing and lending connections, respectively. The reported regressions include country

ﬁxed eﬀects.25 All regressions include trend and continue to control for total borrowing and lending,

this time by an individual bank in a given year.

      In all regressions we also allow for the eﬀects to be diﬀerent for large banks. For the analysis of

new borrowing connections, we label banks as “large” if their total borrowing over the entire sample

is in the top 10% of that variable’s distribution, excluding banks that did not borrow. Similarly,

  25
     The results of linear probability regressions are almost identical if we include bank ﬁxed eﬀects instead, while
including bank ﬁxed eﬀects in negative binomial regression is computationally challenging given the sample size.



                                                         30
for the analysis of new lending connections, we label banks as “large” if their total lending over

the entire sample is in the top 10% of the total lending distribution, excluding banks that did not

lend. Finally, for the analysis of the probability of becoming a key bank, we label banks as “large”

if they fall into larger lender and large borrower category. Using this approach, we code, out of

7526 banks in our sample 246 banks as large borrowers, 396 banks as large lenders and 60 banks as

both large borrowers and large lenders. We interact our variables of interest with the “large bank”

indicator, which itself has a positive and strongly signiﬁcant eﬀect, as we expected. Along with the

coeﬃcient and the standard error of the coeﬃcients, we also report the P-value of the signiﬁcance

of the total eﬀect for a large bank, based on the F-test for the linear probability regressions and on

𝜒2 -test for the NB regressions.

    We ﬁnd that the distribution of the impact of the global ﬁnancial crisis was quite diﬀerent

from that of past local recessions and banking crises. Whereas in the aftermaths of recessions and

banking crises small banks tend to be less likely to establish new connections, while large banks

are resilient to these eﬀects, during the global ﬁnancial crisis large banks were much less likely to

establish new connections than they normally would, while small banks were in fact more likely

to ﬁnd new borrowers. Similarly, large banks during the global ﬁnancial crises were less likely to

become key intermediaries, while small banks were not aﬀected in that way. Both small and large

banks that were able to ﬁnd new borrowers and lenders during the crisis, established fewer new

connections than they would otherwise.

    The impact of U.S. recessions is also in contrast with that of the global ﬁnancial crisis. In

the year following a recession in the U.S. small banks are less likely to ﬁned a new borrower and

establish fewer relationships with new lenders, while large banks are in fact more likely to to obtain

new borrowers, although those who do so, establish fewer connections with new borrowers.




                                                 31
6    Conclusion

In this paper we introduced formal measures to describe bank relationships in the global banking

network. Using loan-level data, we constructed networks for each of the years between 1980 and

2009 and computed network statistics for each of the banks that appeared as either a borrower or

a lender in the syndicated loan market during our sample period.

    We ﬁnd that recessions and banking crises have an important systematic eﬀect on the de-

velopment of the global banking network through altering the ways in which banks make new

connections. Global ﬁnancial crisis in particular played an important role by shifting the center of

network from developing to developed countries and by aﬀecting the formation of new relationships

by large banks, banks that are normally immune to the eﬀects of local recessions and banking crises.

    Our ﬁndings have two important implications. A methodological implication is that the struc-

ture of a global banking network responds to economic and ﬁnancial shocks, and it may therefore not

be appropriate to model banking networks as static and exogenous in a dynamic setting, especially

when the eﬀects of ﬁnancial shocks are analyzed. A broad empirical implication is that inasmuch

as bank relationships facilitate international capital ﬂows by overcoming information asymmetry

obstacles, the slow down in building bank relationships during recessions and banking crises, and

especially during the global ﬁnancial crisis, might be important in understanding the patterns of

international capital ﬂows in the aftermath of such events.

                                  Ψ = 𝛼∗ (𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 ) + (2𝛾 + 𝜈)𝑁.

Thus, we can rewrite (4) as
                                           𝜉 − 2𝛾𝑁      𝑁
                                    𝛼∗ =            − ∗     𝜈.                                     (7)
                                           𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁  𝑁 − 𝛾𝑁

    Substituting (4) into (5) and rearranging, we get

                                                       𝑁
                                       𝛼∗ = 1 −                𝜈,                                  (8)
                                                  (𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 )𝑦
                ¯ − 𝑉 − 𝐷∗ )/𝐹 .
where 𝑦 = (𝐹 + 𝜙𝑅
    We can solve these two equations to obtain the short-run solution

                                           𝑦(𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 ) − (𝜉 − 2𝛾𝑁 )
                                 𝛼∗𝑆𝑅 =                              ,                             (9)
                                              (𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁 )(𝑦 − 1)

                                                𝑦(𝜉 − 𝛾𝑁 − 𝑁 ∗
                                       𝜈 𝑆𝑅 =                  .                                  (10)
                                                   𝑁 (𝑦 − 1)

     One can show graphically that the equilibrium is stable if (7) is steeper than (8), that is 𝑦 > 1,
which means that 𝜙𝑅  ¯ − 𝑉 − 𝐷∗ > 0. We can also simply show that both 0 < 𝛼∗ < 1 and 0 < 𝜈 < 1
if the following binding conditions hold:

                                             𝜉 > 𝑁 ∗ + 𝛾𝑁,

                                              𝜉 − (𝑁 ∗ + 𝛾𝑁 )
                                    𝑦−1>                      > 0.
                                                 𝑁 ∗ − 𝛾𝑁

    We can also derive
                                        ∂𝜈 𝑆𝑅     𝑦
                                              =−     < 0,
                                         ∂𝛾      𝑦−1
since 𝑦 > 1 is required for stability of the equilibrium and for interior solution.
    In the long run, (6) has to also hold, which implies that

                                                    𝜙∗
                                             𝛾=          𝜈.                                       (11)
                                                  1 − 𝜙∗

                                                   37
Note that 𝛾 is not a function of 𝛼∗ . Thus, we can simply substitute (11) into (10) to obtain

                                              𝑦(𝜉 − 𝑁 ∗ )(1 − 𝜙∗ )
                                     𝜈 𝐿𝑅 =                        .                             (12)

   We now derive comparative statics for 𝜈 𝑆𝑅 and 𝜈 𝑆𝑅 with respect to parameters of the model.
We have already shown that ∂𝜈 𝑆𝑅 /∂𝛾 < 0. The rest follow:


∂𝜈 𝑆𝑅           1

which is ambiguous because the ﬁrst term in the brackets is negative given 𝑦 > 1 and the second
term is positive given 𝐺 < 0. The diﬀerence between the eﬀects on 𝜈 𝑆𝑅 and 𝜈 𝐿𝑅 is the adjustment
of 𝛾. We will assume that these eﬀects are second-order and therefore overall eﬀect of 𝜙∗ on the
number of new connections made is positive. We will make a similar assumption in similar cases
in what follows.
     If there is an increase in returns on foreign project for any number of projects ﬁnanced (an
upward shift in 𝑅∗ ), this also implies an increase in 𝜉 for given level of other parameter values. It
follows that such an increase in 𝑅∗ will increase 𝜈 both in short and in long run, because

                         ∂𝜈 𝑆𝑅       𝑦                ∂𝜈 𝐿𝑅     𝑦(1 − 𝜙∗ )

     Since 𝜙 and 𝑅 ¯ always enter together, their eﬀects will be the same, hence we simply take
derivative with respect to their product 𝜙𝑅:¯

    The fee for establishing a new connection 𝐹 has two eﬀects — it increases a cost of establishing


                                                   38
a new connection, but it also increases the value of relationship if 𝑓 remains constant. Since we want
to disentangle these two eﬀects, we will examine separately an increase in fee for a new connection
holding the value of relationship 𝑉 constant (that is, an increase in 𝐹 and 𝑓 of equal magnitude),
and a decline in the value of relationship holding fee for a new connection constant (that is, and
increase in 𝑓 holding 𝐹 constant).

which are both ambiguous unless we want to make assumptions on the shape of 𝑅∗ function. There
are two opposing eﬀects at play — when 𝐹 increases, home banks are less interested in ﬁnancing
foreign projects, while foreign banks are also less interested in ﬁnancing their projects because
return on intermediation increases. Finally,
