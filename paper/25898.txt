This paper studies distributional effects of education on health. In 1972, England, Scotland, and
Wales raised their minimum school-leaving age from 15 to 16 for students born after 9/1/1957.
Using a regression discontinuity design and objective health measures for 0.27 million
individuals, we find that education reduced body size and increased blood pressure in middle age.
The reduction in body size was concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution with a 7.5
percentage point reduction in obesity. The increase in blood pressure was concentrated at the
lower tail of the distribution with no effect on stage 2 hypertension.

           DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF EDUCATION ON HEALTH

           Silvia H. Barcellos, Leandro S. Carvalho, and Patrick Turley*


          This paper studies distributional effects of education on health. In 1972, England,

          Scotland, and Wales raised their minimum school-leaving age from 15 to 16 for

          students born after 9/1/1957. Using a regression discontinuity design and

          objective health measures for 0.27 million individuals, we find that education

          reduced body size and increased blood pressure in middle age. The reduction in

          body size was concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution with a 7.5

          percentage point reduction in obesity. The increase in blood pressure was

          concentrated at the lower tail of the distribution with no effect on stage 2

          hypertension. JEL codes: I10, I20.



           There is broad disagreement about whether education has a causal effect on health

(Grossman 2015). Some studies find that more education causes better health (e.g. Lleras-

Muney 2005) while others find little to no effect (e.g. Clark and Royer 2013). Galama, Lleras-

Muney, and Kippersluis (2018) argue that heterogeneity in these effects may underlie these

conflicting results. Their model lays out conditions for such heterogeneity to exist, and

evidence indicates that such conditions are met: (i) heterogeneity in the labor market returns to

education (Card 2001); (ii) heterogeneity in the non-market returns to education (Barcellos,

Carvalho, and Turley 2018); and (iii) heterogeneity in skill formation as a result of education

(Grenet 2013).

           This paper investigates whether the effects of education on health are heterogeneous by

studying how education affects the distribution of health. If education affects some parts of the

health distribution but not others, then the effect of education on health must vary across

individuals. In particular, the effect may be larger for individuals with poorer health. In a

Grossman-type model, education will cause the unhealthy to invest more in their health than

the healthy because of the diminishing marginal utility of health (Kippersluis and Galama

2014). 1

           Since little is known ex-ante about the dimensions along which such effect may vary, a

distributional approach allows for an unsupervised investigation of heterogeneity, avoiding

multiple hypotheses testing and concerns about the lack of good measures of relevant

dimensions. Moreover, if the effects are concentrated at particular parts of the distribution, a

distributional test may be better powered than a test of difference in means—see Appendix F.

           For this purpose, we exploit a well-known schooling reform in the United Kingdom

using a regression discontinuity design. In 1972, England, Scotland, and Wales raised their

minimum school-leaving age from 15 to 16 for students born on or after September 1, 1957

(students born before this date could drop out at age 15), generating a discontinuity in the

relationship between education and date of birth at the September 1, 1957 “cutoff.” The reform

had the primary effect of inducing students who would have dropped out at age 15 to obtain

exactly one additional year of education. We estimate the distributional effects of education on

health from discontinuities in the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of health at the

birthdate cutoff.




1
 Consistent with this hypothesis, in related work we show that the additional schooling had larger effects on the
BMI of those with greater genetic risk of obesity (Barcellos et al. 2018).


                                                                                                                2
         We use data from the UK Biobank, a study that collected multiple objective and

continuous measures of health between 2006 and 2010; 34-38 years after the policy change.

Using standardized protocols, healthcare technicians and nurses measured the BMI, body fat

percentage, waist and hip circumferences, lung function, and blood pressure of more than a

quarter million people born in England, Scotland, and Wales between September 1, 1947 and

August 31, 1967. The unprecedented availability of objective health measures for such a large

sample permits well-powered estimation of distributional treatment effects. To ease concerns

about multiple hypotheses testing, we focus our analysis on three health indices constructed

from the multiple measures available: body size, lung function, and blood pressure.

    There are three main takeaways from the distributional analysis. First, staying in school

until age 16 improves one dimension of health—there is a reduction in body size—and worsens

another: there is an increase in blood pressure. 2 Second, it reveals that these effects vary

considerably along the health distribution. To give a sense of how effects are concentrated,

staying in school until age 16 reduces the 90th percentile of the body size distribution by 0.38

of a standard deviation—that is equal to 2.5 times the effect on average body size. Third, the

effects on body size and on blood pressure occur in different parts of their respective

distributions: while the effect on body size is concentrated at the upper tail (i.e., among the

least healthy), the effect on blood pressure is concentrated at the lower tail (i.e., among the

most healthy). 3

    We conduct a distributional test based on Shen and Zhang (2016) to formally investigate

whether these changes are statistically significant, testing differences in the bottom and top

halves of the CDFs of our three health indices. The test rejects at the 5% significance level the



2
  In our sample, there are very few participants with low blood pressure or who are underweight.
3
  We do not have the power to test whether some people experienced both a reduction in body size and an
increase in blood pressure. However, given that there is a moderate positive correlation between these two
outcomes (𝜌𝜌 = 0.3), it is unlikely (though possible) that those who experienced reductions in body size were the
same individuals experiencing increases in blood pressure. See Appendix Figure D3.


                                                                                                               3
null of equality for the top half of the body size distribution (p-value of 0.013) and for the

bottom half of the blood pressure distribution (p-value of 0.010). We only find suggestive

evidence of a positive effect on lung function.

The results from our distributional analyses suggest that the effects of education on health are

heterogeneous. Our estimates recover the distributional effects on compliers, that is, students

who stayed in school an additional year because of the schooling reform. If the effects were

homogeneous, we would see effects across the whole support of the complier distribution, with

the largest effect at the mode (see Appendix I). This is because, if education affects each

complier equally, the distributional effect at a given point should roughly correspond to the

mass at this point in the pre-reform complier distribution. As described above, this is not what

we find: effects are concentrated at the top of the body size distribution, with the largest effect

at the 78th percentile. Therefore, our findings are not consistent with homogeneous treatment

effects. Importantly, our method recovers differences in the health distribution of compliers

only and does not rely on rank preservation assumptions.

   We also conduct an exploratory analysis to investigate possible channels through which

education may affect health. While improvements in SES and diet may explain the reduction

in body size, the channels for the increase in blood pressure are less clear. We do show,

however, that education allowed individuals to hold better jobs in middle age. One possibility

is that, by changing the types of occupations and careers individuals have, education might

have had an effect on job responsibilities, expectations, and work-related stress. This would be

consistent with evidence that academically successful African Americans in the U.S. have

higher biomarkers related to cardiometabolic risk (i.e. blood pressure and stress hormones)

than other groups (Brody et al. 2013, Miller et al. 2015, Chen et al. 2015) and with findings

that, despite improving SES outcomes, the 1972 reform had detrimental effects on mental

health (Aventano et al. 2017).



                                                                                                 4
    For the sake of comparison, we also estimate the effects of education on average health. A

number of studies have exploited changes in compulsory schooling laws to study such effects

(e.g., Lleras-Muney 2005; Albouy and Lequien 2009; Silles 2009; Powdthavee 2010;

Kemptner et al. 2011; Clark & Royer 2013; Jürges et al. 2013; Davies et al. 2017; Janke et al.

2018; Meghir et al. forthcoming). We find that staying in school until age 16 reduces body size

by 0.15 of a standard deviation and increases blood pressure by 0.15 of a standard deviation,

but these estimates are only significant at the 10% level. 4

    In an apparent contrast to the results of this paper, Clark and Royer (2013) estimate a

precise null effect of the 1972 ROSLA reform on mortality. They also find no statistically

significant effect on the averages of non-mortality health outcomes. 5 Our estimates of the

effects on average health are, however, broadly consistent with their corresponding estimates.

While Clark and Royer had very large samples to estimate the effect of education on mortality,

their estimates of the effects on non-mortality health outcomes are less precise because they

had more limited samples for such outcomes. For this reason, our estimates lie within the 95%

confidence intervals of Clark and Royer (2010, 2013)’s corresponding estimates.

    While the main take-away from Clark and Royer (2013) is that education does not affect

health, our results suggest a more nuanced story. The distributional analysis shows that

education can affect the health of some subpopulations. The heterogeneity of the effects of

education on health may explain the conflicting findings in the literature (Galama et al. 2018).

First, education affects different parts of the health distribution differently, implying that the

effects vary across individuals. Second, the effects also vary across outcomes: the additional

schooling caused a reduction in body size and an increase in blood pressure.


4
  We also find an improvement in lung function that is marginally significant at 10% but that goes away once
controls are added.
5
  Clark and Royer also analyzed the effects of education on particular points of the distribution of BMI and
blood pressure, but these clinical cutoffs are arguably arbitrary (Komaroff 2016) and the approach may overlook
changes in other parts of the distribution.



                                                                                                             5
    Despite this, the question remains as to how education could affect some health outcomes

while having no downstream effects on mortality. There are several hypotheses for such a

result. First, those affected by the 1972 ROSLA would have been less than 50 years old at the

time of the Clark and Royer study. It is possible that not enough time had passed to observe

meaningful differences in mortality. 6 Second, health is a multi-dimensional construct, and, as

we see in this study, education may improve some dimensions of health while worsening

others. As a result, the ultimate effect of education on mortality may be attenuated by these

opposing factors. In short, Clark and Royer’s finding of no effect on mortality are plausibly

consistent with our results.

    The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 discusses the 1972 raising of the school

leaving-age reform and the data. In Section 2 we present the effects of the reform on education

and the effects on average health. Section 3 discusses the methods used to estimate the

distributional effects with results shown in Section 4. Section 5 presents suggestive evidence

on mechanisms and Section 6 concludes.


        1. Background and Data


                            A. The 1972 Raising of the School Leaving Age


    The British compulsory schooling laws specify the maximum age by which children must

start school and the minimum age at which they can leave school. In this paper, we exploit the

1972 Raising of School Leaving Age (ROSLA) legislation, which increased the minimum

school-leaving age from 15 to 16 years of age in England, Scotland, and Wales. These laws

and their implementation have been extensively documented in other studies (see Clark and

Royer 2010, 2013) so we only include a brief summary of its main features here.



6
  This argument would not apply to their 1947 ROSLA results, but we also do not know whether the 1947
ROSLA had the same effects on health as we estimate for the 1972 ROSLA.


                                                                                                        6
    The UK’s 1944 Education Act raised the minimum school-leaving age from 14 to 15 years

of age in England, Wales, and Scotland and gave the Minister of Education the power to further

raise it to 16 years when conditions allowed. The Minister did so in January 1972 for Scotland

(Statutory Instrument No. 59) 7 and in March 1972 for England and Wales (Statutory Instrument

No. 444) 8. Both changes took effect in September 1, 1972, implying that those who were 15 or

younger before that date (born on September 1, 1957 or later) had to stay in school until at least

age 16 in the three countries (hereafter, we use the term “stayed in school until age 16” to refer

to those who stayed in school until at least age 16). Infrastructure investments, such as school

building to absorb the additional students, preceded the 1972 ROSLA but key elements of the

school system did not change with the policy.

      Figure 1, which displays the fraction of study participants who stayed in school until age

16 (y-axis) by quarter of birth (x-axis), shows that the policy generated a discontinuous

relationship between these two variables. There is a large jump at the September 1, 1957 cutoff

marked by the vertical dashed line. Those born during the summer months could in practice

drop out at age 15 even after the 1972 ROSLA, since the law required students to be 16 by the

start of the next school year. We estimate that the policy increased the fraction of UK Biobank

participants who stayed in school until age 16 by 15 percentage points – see Table 1. 9

  The effect on staying in school until at least age 17 is an order of magnitude smaller: about 2 percentage points.
In Clark and Royer’s words (AER 2013): “the 1972 change had small, at best, effects on the fractions completing
11 or fewer years…To a first approximation therefore, one can view these law changes as forcing students that
would previously have left at the earliest opportunity to stay in school for one more year” (pg. 2102).



                                                                                                                  7
               Figure 1: Fraction Staying in School until Age 16 by Quarter of Birth
Notes: The figure shows the fraction of study participants who stayed in school until age 16 by quarter of birth. The dashed vertical line marks

the first birth cohort affected by the 1972 school-leaving age reform. Cohorts born to the right of the line had to stay in school until age 16

while cohorts born before could leave at age 15. The curves show quadratic polynomials in quarter of birth that capture birth cohort trends.

The circumference of each circle reflects the number of participants born in that quarter. N = 271,082.




        Notice there is a cyclical drop in the fraction of students staying in school until age 16,

corresponding to those born between June and August. This phenomenon is not specific to our

data and has been noted by others. According to Clark and Royer (2013), “when the minimum

leaving age became age 16, students had to stay until part way through grade 10. Grade 10

finishes with the “O level” exam period and, technically, students finish when they complete

their last exam. Since the exam period starts in late May and finishes in mid-June, starting in

1972, students born in late June, July, and August could leave at 15, technically younger than

the minimum leaving age (16)” (pg. 2 of Online Appendix). We include calendar month of

birth dummies in our regressions to control for this seasonality.




                                                                                                                                              8
                                                     B. Data


     We use data from the UK Biobank, a large, population-based prospective study initiated by

the UK National Health Service (NHS) (Sudlow et al. 2015). Between 2006 and 2010,

invitations were mailed to 9.2 million people between the ages of 40 and 69 who were

registered with the NHS and lived up to about 25 miles from one of 22 study assessment centers

distributed throughout the UK (Allen et al. 2012) – see Appendix Figure D1. 10 The sample is

formed by 503,325 individuals who agreed to participate (i.e. a response rate of 5.47%).

Although the sample is not nationally representative, our estimates have internal validity

because there is no differential selection on the two sides of the September 1, 1957 cutoff – see

Appendix A. 11

     Physical measures, such as anthropometrics, spirometry, and blood pressure, were collected

of survey participants. The collection was standardized across centers and was conducted by

trained nurses or healthcare practitioners. Every participant was genotyped.

     In this paper, we focus on objective and continuous measures of health. Continuous

measures because we are interested in studying how education affects the distribution of health.

Objective measures because research shows that discrepancies between subjective (e.g. self-

reported hypertension) and objective measures of health (e.g. objectively measured

hypertension) vary with socioeconomic status (e.g. Johnston et al. 2009).

     We restrict ourselves to three dimensions of health (that satisfy the two criteria above and)

that can be arguably affected by education: body size, lung function, and blood pressure. 12

Weight and body size can be affected by education through diet and physical exercise. Lung



10
   The NHS has contact details for an estimated 98% of the UK population.
11
   When the predetermined variable is continuous, we test whether the pre- and post-reforms distributions are
different. When the predetermined variable is dichotomous, we conduct a test of difference in means.
12
   The other objective and continuous measures of health currently available in the UK Biobank are either
available for just a subsample (e.g., arterial stiffness, bone densitometry of heel, ECG) or there is no clear
hypothesis on how they could be affected by education (e.g., hand grip strength).


                                                                                                                 9
function can be affected by education through smoking and pollution. Blood pressure may be

affected by education through diet, physical exercise, medication, and stress. Moreover, these

health dimensions are risk factors for high-prevalence diseases such as diabetes (Chan et al.

1994), lung cancer (Tockman et al. 1987) and cardiovascular disease (Kannel 1996). The UK

Biobank has multiple measures of each of these health dimensions.

     Next, we describe how each of these health dimensions is measured in the data.

     Body Size

     We use three measures of body size: BMI, body fat percentage, and waist-hip ratio. 13 A

bioimpedance analyzer was used to calculate body fat percentage. This device passes a low

electrical current through the body. Water conducts electricity. While fat contains very little

water, muscle contains 70% water. The bioimpedance analyzer calculates body fat from the

speed of the current: The slower the signal travels, the greater the fat content.

     Lung Function

     A spirometry test was conducted to measure participants’ lung function. The spirometer is

a small machine attached to a mouthpiece by a cable that measures the volume and speed of

air after a forced exhale. Participants were asked to fill their lungs as much as possible and to

blow air out as hard and as fast as possible in the mouthpiece. 14 Three parameters were

measured: 1) forced expiratory volume in the first second is the amount of air exhaled during

the first second; 2) forced vital capacity is the total amount of air exhaled during the forced

breath; and 3) peak expiratory flow is the fastest rate of exhalation. These parameters are used

to assess pulmonary conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.



13
   The UK Biobank provides two measures of BMI: one calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
squared (in meters) and one using height and electrical impedance to quantify mass. We take the average of
these two measures. We can get very similar results if we use exclusively the first measure of BMI (i.e., the
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). The waist-hip ratio is equal to the waist
circumference divided by the hip circumference.
14
   They were instructed to continue blowing until no more air came out of their lungs. Up to three attempts were
allowed. The participant was allowed a third attempt if the first two blows did not satisfy the reproducibility
criteria of the spirometry protocol.


                                                                                                             10
We follow DeMateis et al. (2016)’s criteria to identify acceptable expiratory maneuvers in the

UK Biobank data. Valid spirometry measures are available for 79% of our sample. 15

     Blood Pressure

     Two measurements were taken of the diastolic and systolic blood pressures of each study

participant. We use the average of these two measurements.

     Summary Indices

     In order to reduce the number of outcomes and partly address concerns about multiple

hypothesis testing, we construct for each health dimension a summary index that is a weighted

average of the different outcomes measuring that dimension:

        1. Body size: body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat percentage;

        2. Lung function: forced expiratory volume in the first second, forced vital capacity,

            and peak expiratory flow;

        3. Blood pressure: diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

First, each measure is standardized separately by gender, using as a reference those born in the

12 months before September 1, 1957. We then follow the procedure proposed by Anderson

(2008), weighting the measures by their variance-covariance matrix. The weights are calculated

to maximize the amount of information captured in the index. Finally, we construct a fourth

“summary index” that is a summary of the body size, the lung function, and the blood pressure

indices, using the same weighting procedure. We construct all four indices so that a higher

number corresponds to worse health.

     The correlation between the body size and lung function indices is 0.20. The correlation

between the body size and the blood pressure indices is 0.30. The correlation between the lung

function and the blood pressure indices is 0.10. The correlations between the summary index



15
  Appendix Figure C5 and Appendix Table C1 show that participants born before and after September 1957 are
equally likely to have valid spirometry measures.


                                                                                                       11
and the body size, lung function, and blood pressure indices are respectively 0.69, 0.67, and

0.68.


         2.   Mean Effects


                   A. Effects of the Compulsory Schooling Change on Education


        We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the “first stage”, i.e., the

effect of the 1972 ROSLA on education. In particular, we estimate the following regression:


                                     𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎0 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝒙𝒙′𝑖𝑖 𝒂𝒂2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,   (1)


where 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 is a measure of the educational attainment of individual 𝑖𝑖; 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is 1 if individual

𝑖𝑖 was born on or after September 1, 1957 (and 0 otherwise); 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is individual 𝑖𝑖’s date of birth;

and the vector 𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 contains predetermined characteristics. Date of birth is measured in days

relative to the cutoff, such that 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 0 for someone born on September 1, 1957. The function

𝑓𝑓(∙) captures birth cohort trends in educational attainment, which are allowed to differ on either

side of the September 1, 1957 cutoff. The coefficient 𝑎𝑎1 gives the effect of the 1972 ROSLA

on educational attainment. 16

        We restrict the data to study participants born in England, Scotland, or Wales within 10

years of September 1957 – that is, born between September 1, 1947 and August 31, 1967 – and

use a quadratic polynomial in date of birth to capture cohort trends (i.e., function 𝑓𝑓(∙) in

equation (1)). 17 In Appendix B we show our main results are robust to the choice of bandwidth

and to the use of linear trends. 18 We use triangular kernel weights that give greater weight to



16
   The inclusion of predetermined controls in equation (1) is not needed for identification but can improve the
precision of estimates.
17
   We opt to use 10-year bandwidths because, to our knowledge, there are no existing methods to estimate the
optimal bandwidth for distributional RDD.
18
   Gelman and Imbens (2016) caution against the use of higher order polynomials (higher than 2) in RDD.


                                                                                                                  12
study participants born closer to the cutoff. The set of predetermined characteristics include

gender, age in days (at the time of the baseline assessment) and age squared, dummies for

ethnicity, dummies for country of birth, and dummies for calendar month of birth (to control

for seasonality). 19

      Notice that even though previous work studying the 1972 ROSLA clustered standard

errors by month-year of birth (e.g., Clark and Royer 2013; Davies et al. 2017), we do not need

to cluster our standard errors because our data include exact date of birth. As Card and Lee

(2008) discuss, in applications where the running variable is only reported in coarse intervals

(e.g., month-year of birth), researchers have to choose a particular functional form for the

model relating the outcomes of interest to the running variable. The deviation between the

expected value of the outcome and the predicted value from a given functional form is modeled

as a random specification error, which is incorporated in inference by clustering the standard

errors for different values of the running variable. This specification error should be negligible

in our context because our data include day-month-year of birth. Appendix Table D4 shows

that we get virtually identical standard errors estimates irrespective of whether we cluster by

date of birth or not.

      Table 1 shows estimates of effects of the 1972 ROSLA on education. Each cell reports

results from a separate ordinary least squares estimation of (1), where we vary the dependent

variable (listed in the column) and whether the predetermined characteristics are included as

controls. The table shows the coefficient on the indicator variable for being born on or after

September 1, 1957, 𝑎𝑎1 , and the mean of the dependent variable among those born in the 12

months before September 1, 1957. Robust standard errors are reported between brackets.




19
  Because participants were surveyed for the baseline assessment between 2006 and 2010, date of birth and age
are not perfectly collinear.


                                                                                                          13
        We estimate that the 1972 ROSLA increased the fraction of study participants staying in

school until age 16 by 14-15 percentage points, an estimate significant at the 1% significance

level. 20 Studies using nationally representative data, such as Clark and Royer (2013), estimate

this figure to be closer to 25 percentage points. This difference is likely due to the composition

of the UK Biobank sample, which is more educated than the overall population (despite the

selectivity of the UK Biobank sample, our estimates have internal validity because there is no

differential selection on the two sides of the September 1, 1957 cutoff – see Appendix A). One

consequence is that the standard errors of our two stages least squares (2SLS) estimates will be

ceteris paribus larger than of studies with nationally representative data, something that is

compensated by the larger sample size of the UK Biobank.



                                               Table 1: Effects on Education




Notes: The table shows the effects of the school reform on education. Each cell corresponds to a separate regression. We report the coefficient

on the indicator variable for being born on or after September 1, 1957 (i.e., “Post”). The dependent variable mean in the bottom row is the

weighted mean among those born in the 12 months before September 1, 1957. Controls include male, age in days and age squared, dummies

for calendar month of birth, dummies for ethnicity, and dummies for country of birth. Robust standard errors. N = 271,082 for “Stayed in

school until 16” and N = 268,551 for all other outcomes.




20
  Estimates of the effect of the 1972 school-leaving age reform on staying in school until age 17 or later are an
order of magnitude smaller than the effect on staying in school till age 16 and are generally not robust to the
inclusion of controls – see Appendix Figure D2 and Appendix Table D1.


                                                                                                                                           14
        One may worry that these students forced to stay in school an extra year did not learn

much if they did not put effort into it. The evidence does not support this hypothesis. By the

70’s high schools offered a series of two-year courses that ran through grades nine and ten and

required students to take exams at the end of grade ten (the grade they are typically in by age

16): Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or a General Certificate of Education (GCE)

Ordinary Level (also known as an O-level). By compelling students to stay in school until grade

ten, the 1972 ROSLA gave students an incentive to complete these courses and get these

qualifications, which are valued in the labor market (Dickson and Smith 2011).



                     Figure 2: Fraction with a CSE or O-level by Quarter of Birth




Notes: The figure shows the fraction of study participants with a CSE or O-level qualification by quarter of birth. The dashed vertical line

marks the introduction of the policy. Cohorts born to the right of the line had to stay in school until age 16 while cohorts born before could

leave at age 15. The curves show quadratic polynomials in quarter of birth that capture birth cohort trends. The circumference of each circle

reflects the number of participants born in that quarter. N = 268,551.




        Figure 2 shows that the policy generated a discontinuous increase in the fraction of study

participants with these qualifications. In Table 1 we estimate that the policy increased the


                                                                                                                                          15
fraction of study participants with a CSE by 6-7 percentage points and the fraction with an O-

level by 3-4 percentage points. Interestingly, the fraction with an A-level, an exam typically

taken at age 18 and used for college admissions, increased by 1-2 percentage points. The

fraction without any formal qualification dropped by 5 percentage points. All of these reduced-

form estimates are statistically significant at 1%. We find no effect of the policy on having a

college degree. Consistent with these results, we document that the policy increased household

income 21, especially at lower income levels, and enabled workers to get “better jobs”, that is,

to have occupations with higher socioeconomic status 22– see Appendix Table E1 and Appendix

Table E2.


                                    B.        Effects on Average Health


      We now turn to the effects of the 1972 ROSLA on average health. We are interested in

the relationship between health and education:


                                     𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑16𝑖𝑖 + 𝑔𝑔(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝒙𝒙′𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷2 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 ,   (2)


where 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 is a health measure for individual 𝑖𝑖. 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸16𝑖𝑖 , an indicator for whether

individual 𝑖𝑖 stayed in school until age 16, is our endogenous measure of education. The function

𝑔𝑔(∙) captures birth cohort trends in health and is allowed to differ on either side of the

September 1, 1957 cutoff. We substitute (1) into (2) to get the “reduced-form” effect of the

1972 ROSLA on average health:

                                     𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾0 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝑗𝑗(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝒙𝒙′𝑖𝑖 𝜸𝜸2 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 .     (3)




21
   These results are broadly consistent with Grenet (2013) that finds that the extra year of schooling induced by
the 1972 ROSLA increased wages.
22
   Respondents who were employed or self-employed were asked in a verbal interview to describe their jobs.
Respondent’s answers were coded following the Standard Occupation Classification 2000. We classify the
socioeconomic status of the occupations using the 2000 National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-
SEC), the primary social classification in the United Kingdom. See Appendix Table D2.


                                                                                                                   16
The coefficient 𝛾𝛾1 gives the effect of the school leaving-age reform on average health. The

RDD identifying assumption is that, in the absence of the reform, our outcomes of interest

would have been smooth across the September 1, 1957 threshold. This assumption is violated

if determinants of health are discontinuous at the cutoff (Lee 2008). In Appendix A we partially

test for such violations by investigating whether the average (or the cumulative distribution

function) of predetermined characteristics, such as gender and place of birth, are discontinuous

around September 1, 1957. Since the UK Biobank genotyped the full sample, we also test for

the smoothness of a pair of genetic variables, which are determined at conception and are

objectively measured. 23 Our analyses indicate that these characteristics are smooth across the

September 1 1957 threshold, which strengthens our confidence that the RDD results provide

unbiased estimates of the causal effects of education on the health of UK Biobank participants.

      We estimate the causal effect of staying in school until age 16 on average health, 𝛽𝛽1 ,

through two stages least squares (2SLS), using the indicator for being born on or after

September 1, 1957 (i.e., 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ) to instrument for staying in school until age 16 (i.e., 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸16𝑖𝑖 )

in equation (2). We adopt the same specifications used to estimate the effects on education (see

section 2.A), namely: 10-year bandwidths, quadratic polynomials to capture birth cohort trends,

triangular kernel weights, and the same set of controls. Appendix B shows our results are robust

to linear cohort trends and smaller bandwidths.

      Figure 3 examines the effects of the 1972 compulsory schooling change on average

health. The graphs show average health (y-axis) by quarter of birth (x-axis), where health is

measured by the four health indices: the body size index (top left); the lung function index (top

right); the blood pressure index (bottom left); and the summary index (bottom right).

  See Online Appendix of Barcellos, Carvalho and Turley (2018) for details about the construction of genetic
variables.


                                                                                                           17
      Table 2 shows regression estimates of the effects of the 1972 compulsory schooling

change on average health. 24 The first rows show the coefficients on the indicator variable for

being born on or after September 1, 1957, 𝛾𝛾1 in equation (3), from reduced-form estimates. The

third row shows the coefficients on staying in school until age 16 from 2SLS estimates, 𝛽𝛽1 in

equation (2), where the indicator variable for being born on or after September 1, 1957 is used

to instrument for staying in school until age 16. Again, the health indices were constructed such

that higher values correspond to worse health.

      Overall Figure 3 suggests education may lead to small average improvements in health,

with minor discontinuous decreases in the body size, lung function, and summary indices at

the cutoff. One noteworthy exception is blood pressure. There is a discontinuous increase in

the blood pressure index at the cutoff, suggesting that education may worsen this particular

dimension of health. Appendix Figures B1-B4 assess the sensitivity of Figure 3 to changes in

the bandwidth and to using linear trends.

      Table 2 shows that the effects on body size and blood pressure are statistically significant

at the 10% significance level. The 2SLS point estimates imply that staying in school until age

16 decreases the body size, the lung function, and the summary indices respectively by 0.15-

0.16, 0.17, and 0.12 of a standard deviation. At the same time, staying in school until age 16

increases the blood pressure index by 0.15 of a standard deviation.

       The p-value of a test of the difference between the effects on the body size and the blood

pressure indices is 0.004. The difference between the effects on the lung function and the blood

pressure indices has a p-value of 0.069. The difference between the effects on the body size

and the lung function indices has a p-value of 0.906. These results, notably the difference

between blood pressure and body size, point to the importance of treating health as multi-




24
   Notice that while Figure 3 uses quarter of birth Table 2 uses day of birth (e.g., September 1, 1957). The same
distinction applies to Figure 1 and Table 1.


                                                                                                               18
dimensional and considering the effects of education on different dimensions separately.

Focusing on the analysis of summary measures of health can lead to misleading conclusions of

no health impact if effects going on opposite directions cancel out, as is the case in Table 2.

      Our estimates lie within the 95% confidence intervals of Clark and Royer (2010) – see

Appendix Table D3 and Appendix Figure D7. 25 Clark and Royer (2010) do not estimate the

effects on systolic blood pressure or on lung function. As discussed above, even though we

have a larger sample than Clark and Royer (2010), we have a smaller first stage, which explains

why our standard errors are not substantially smaller than theirs.

       When making this comparison, one should keep in mind that the UK Biobank is not a

nationally representative sample. It recruited only individuals living within 25 miles of one of

the 22 assessment centers, all of which were located in urban areas. Fry et al. (2017) also

document that younger, males living in socioeconomically deprived areas and in particular

regions of the UK were less likely to accept the invitation to join the study.

       In Appendix H, we compare compliers in the UK Biobank to compliers in the Health

Survey for England – a nationally representative sample – in terms of objectively-measured

health outcomes, namely BMI, waist-hip ratio, and diastolic and systolic blood pressures. 26 We

find that compliers in the UK Biobank have lower BMIs and waist-hip ratios, but that they also

have higher diastolic and systolic blood pressures. 27 Thus, we do not find unequivocal evidence

that the UK Biobank sample is healthier than the average population (among compliers).

Moreover, while these differences in health are statistically significant, their magnitudes are


25
   In contrast, our results lie outside the confidence intervals of Davies et al. (2017), which study the same
reform and data (UK Biobank). We believe this is due to differences in the weighting procedure they use, their
specification (bandwidth and polynomial choice) and sample selection (they do not include Wales and
Scotland).
26
   We approximate compliers as those born before September 1957 who dropped out of school at age 15 or
younger. The UK Biobank sample is restricted to respondents living in England. We focus on objectively-
measured health outcomes to avoid concerns that differences in self-reported measures may be partly due to
differences in question wording.
27
   Fry et al. (2017) also find that the UK Biobank sample has lower BMI than the Health Survey for England
sample. Notice, however, that they are not comparing compliers. They also do not compare the two samples in
terms of blood pressure.


                                                                                                             19
small. Finally, for each health outcome, there is substantial overlap between the distribution in

the UK Biobank sample and in the Health Survey for England sample.

        We also used genetic data and a nationally representative sample, the English

Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), to investigate the selectivity of the UK Biobank

sample. Genetic data may be useful in this regard because it is fixed at conception. We

calculated the distribution of the polygenic score for educational attainment—an index created

from millions of genetic markers—in the ELSA and the UK Biobank samples. Appendix figure

H5 shows that, while there are differences, there is substantial overlap in the support of the two

distributions. Moreover, despite concerns about sample selection, our results retain their

internal validity—see Appendix A.

        3. Methods for Distributional Effects Estimates


       Even though the effects on average health are informative, they may conceal larger

effects on particular parts of the health distribution with important policy implications.

Moreover, the average effects documented here are suggestive at best, being only significant

at the 10% level. As illustrated in Appendix F, if the effects of education on health are

concentrated at particular parts of the health distribution, a distributional test may be better

powered than a test of difference in means. In this section, we describe the methods we use to

estimate how education affects the distribution of health.

       In Section 2.B, we estimated the effect of education on average health (of compliers) by

investigating if there was a discontinuity in the relationship between average health and date

of birth at the September 1, 1957 cutoff. Here we estimate the effect of education on the health

distribution (of compliers) by investigating if, at the September 1, 1957 cutoff, there is a

discontinuity in the relationship between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of health

and date of birth. 28

       The assumptions of our proposed method are similar to those of a traditional RDD

(Imbens and Lemieux 2008). The key difference is that, while a traditional RDD requires that

the expectations of the potential outcomes are continuous in the running variable at the

threshold, our method requires that the distributions of potential outcomes are continuous in

the running variable at that point (Shen and Zheng 2015). While we cannot test this assumption

formally, we find no significant discontinuity in the distributions of several predetermined

variables, strengthening our confidence that this assumption holds—see Appendix A.




28
  The RDD identifies differences in the marginal distributions of cohorts affected and unaffected by the reform.
Stronger assumptions (such as rank preservation) would be needed to estimate the distribution of treatment
effects.


                                                                                                             22
       We want to estimate the local distributional treatment effect (LDTE) for compliers. Let

the pre-reform CDF be the CDF for compliers in the limit when date of birth is converging to

September 1, 1957 from the left (i.e., 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 < 0):


                                     𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) =      lim Pr(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ ≤ ℎ|𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷).
                                                       𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷→0−



Similarly, the post-reform CDF is defined as the CDF for compliers in the limit when date of

birth is converging to September 1, 1957 from the right (i.e., 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 > 0):


                                    𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) =     lim Pr(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ ≤ ℎ|𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷).
                                                       𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷→0+



The LDTE, which is the discontinuity in the CDF at September 1, 1957 (i.e., 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 0), is

estimated as the difference between 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) and 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) at a given ℎ:


                                                  𝜇𝜇(ℎ) = 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) − 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ).                            (4)


         To estimate 𝜇𝜇(ℎ), in practice we discretize the support of the distribution of health and

then estimate (5) for each grid point ℎ: 29


                   I(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) = 𝜃𝜃0 (ℎ) + 𝜃𝜃1 (ℎ)𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ; ℎ) + 𝒙𝒙′𝑖𝑖 𝜽𝜽2 (ℎ) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 (ℎ), (5)

  For each one of the three health indices, we first calculate the 1st and the 99th percentiles among those born
before September 1, 1957:

 Next, we define the starting point of the grid as the minimum of the 1st percentiles among the health indices and
the endpoint as the maximum of the 99th percentiles among the health indices:
                                                                                 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏

The grid consists of 21 points uniformly distributed between ℎ1 and ℎ21 .


                                                                                                                     23
where I(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) is an indicator variable for whether the health index of individual 𝑖𝑖 is

smaller or equal to ℎ. The function 𝑙𝑙(∙ ; ℎ) capture birth cohort trends, which are allowed to

differ on either side of the cutoff date and to vary with ℎ. It is approximated by a quadratic

polynomial of date of birth in days. 30 We estimate (5) through 2SLS using the indicator variable

for being born on or after September 1, 1957 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ) to instrument for staying in school until

age 16 (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 ). The coefficient on the latter, 𝜃𝜃1 (ℎ), estimates the discontinuity in

Pr(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) at 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0 and thus provides an estimate of 𝜇𝜇(ℎ). 31

          We find it easier to visualize 𝜇𝜇̂ (∙) by plotting in the same graph the pre-reform CDF

𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (∙) and the post-reform CDF 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (∙). 32 For a given grid point ℎ, we proceed in three steps.

First, we estimate 𝜇𝜇(ℎ). Second, we estimate 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) – see next paragraph. Third, we estimate

𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) as the sum of 𝐹𝐹�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) and 𝜇𝜇̂ (ℎ). We repeat this procedure for each one of the 21 grid

points. Finally, we draw the estimated pre-reform and post-reform CDFs by drawing 𝐹𝐹�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ)

and 𝐹𝐹�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) against ℎ. For any given ℎ, the vertical distance between 𝐹𝐹�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) and 𝐹𝐹�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) is

equal to 𝜇𝜇̂ (ℎ).

          To estimate the pre-reform CDF 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (∙), we restrict the sample to respondents born

before September 1, 1957 and who left school at age 15 or younger (i.e., “the compliers”) and

estimate equation (6) for each grid point ℎ:


                                             I(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) = 𝛿𝛿0 (ℎ) + 𝑘𝑘(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ; ℎ) + 𝜉𝜉𝑖𝑖 (ℎ),                           (6)




30
   In our main specification with a quadratic polynomial:
       𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ; ℎ) = 𝜆𝜆1 (ℎ)𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆2 (ℎ)[𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ]2 + 𝜆𝜆3 (ℎ)𝐼𝐼{𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0}𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆4 (ℎ)𝐼𝐼{𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0}[𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ]2 .
31
   Consider (7), which is the reduced-form version of (5). There is an RD graph for each grid point ℎ for a total
of 21 graphs (per health index). In Appendix Figures B11-B13, we show corresponding graphs for the 10th, 25th,
50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of the distribution of those born between September 1, 1956 and August 31,
1957.
32
   In the bottom panel of Appendix Figures B14-B16 we plot 𝜇𝜇̂ (ℎ) against ℎ.


                                                                                                                                      24
where the function 𝑘𝑘(∙ ; ℎ) captures pre-reform birth cohort trends in health. 33 We can closely

represent compliers born before September 1, 1957 by making this sample restriction because

there are very few never-takers in our sample (i.e., individuals who would leave school before

age 16 whether they were born before or after September 1, 1957). The coefficient on the

constant, 𝛿𝛿0 (ℎ), estimates Pr(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) as 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 → 0− and thus provides an estimate of

𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ). Note that we estimate 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) in order to graphically display our results, but none of

our findings depends on 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ) (e.g. results in Table 3 do not depend on estimates of 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (ℎ)).

       Inference based on the standard errors generated by 2SLS estimates of (5) is problematic

because it leads to a large number of highly correlated statistical tests, raising concerns about

multiple hypothesis testing. We, therefore, use a single distributional test based on Shen and

Zhang (2016) to formally investigate whether education changes the distribution of health. Our

test compares the pre- and post-reform CDFs of the whole population. Under the assumptions

of Shen and Zhang (2016), however, any discontinuity in the CDF of the population necessarily

implies that there is a discontinuity in the CDF of compliers. This test is therefore based on the

reduced-form specification:


                     I(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 ≤ ℎ) = 𝜅𝜅0 (ℎ) + 𝜅𝜅1 (ℎ)𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 |ℎ) + 𝒙𝒙′𝑖𝑖 𝜿𝜿2 (ℎ) + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 (ℎ). (7)


       The basis of our test is that—under the null hypothesis of no effect on the health

distribution—the function of estimates 𝜅𝜅̂ 1 [ℎ(𝜏𝜏)], where ℎ(𝜏𝜏) is the value corresponding to the

𝜏𝜏th quantile of 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖 , is a Brownian bridge (Shen and Zhang 2016). 34 In contrast to Shen and

Zhang (2016), which implements a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we perform an Anderson-




33
   In our main specification with a quadratic polynomial: 𝑘𝑘(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ; ℎ) = 𝜙𝜙1 (ℎ)𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝜙𝜙2 (ℎ)[𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ]2 . These
terms take into account any secular trends in our outcomes.
34
   More precisely, the difference in the empirical CDFs estimated in this way is a standard Brownian bridge
times a scalar. See Shen and Zhang (2016) for details on calculating the scalar which allows us to transform the
difference into a standard Brownian bridge.


                                                                                                                        25

                                                                  1 𝜅𝜅

                                                                     𝜏𝜏(1−𝜏𝜏)


Average treatment effects may not be well-powered to detect effects of education on health

that are concentrated on the tails of the health distribution (see Appendix F). We chose the

Anderson-Darling test because it is uniformly powered for the whole range 𝜏𝜏 ∈ [0, 1] (Stephens

1974). In contrast, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is better powered to detect deviations of the

distribution near the median. To test for differences in the bottom half of the health distribution,

we use a modified version of (8), integrating only from zero to 0.5. Similarly, we test

differences in the top half by integrating from 0.5 to 1. 36

           The p-values for the test are calculated by simulation. Specifically, we generate an

independent, standard normally distributed outcome for each individual (such that there is no

discontinuous change in distribution at the discontinuity), and evaluate 𝑇𝑇 (or the upper and

lower distribution analogue) for this simulated variable. By Shen and Zhang (2016), this is

equivalent to drawing from the test statistic distribution under the null. This is repeated 5,000

times. As the p-value, we report the fraction of times our simulated values of 𝑇𝑇 are greater than

our estimated value of 𝑇𝑇.

         The CDF approach described above is closely related to a quantile IV approach. The

CDF approach is based on the vertical distance between the pre- and post-reform CDFs



35
     Shen and Zhang (2016) use max|𝜅𝜅̂ 1 [ℎ(𝜏𝜏)]| as their test statistic, which corresponds to a Kolmogorov-
                                   𝜏𝜏
Smirnov test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has been shown to be well-powered for deviations in the
distribution near the median of the distribution, but is poorly powered to detect differences in the distribution in
the tails (Stephens 1974).
36
   In practice, we calculate the integral 𝑇𝑇 numerically, using the approximation
                                                                            2

where �𝜏𝜏𝑗𝑗 � is a set of discrete points in 0.01 unit increments. When testing the full distribution we sum from 0.01
to 0.99, inclusive. For the lower or upper portion of the distribution, we sum from 0.01 to 0.50 or 0.50 to 0.99
inclusive, respectively.


                                                                                                                  26
whereas a quantile approach is based on the horizontal distance between these two CDFs.

Therefore, either approach would lead us to the same substantive conclusions. We opted to

present the CDF approach because it is the framework used by Shen and Zhang (2016), whose

results we use in our distributional tests. Nevertheless, when we present our results, we also

discuss the effects on some particular quantiles of interest.

      It is important to note that our method only recovers differences in the health distribution

of compliers and it does not rely on rank preservation assumptions. Stronger assumptions

would be needed to recover the distribution of treatment effects, but this is beyond the scope

of our paper. Although we do not estimate the distribution of treatment effects, we can examine

whether our estimates of the effect on the health distribution are consistent with homogeneous

treatment effects. We show in Appendix I that, if treatment effects were homogeneous, our

estimates of distributional effects would behave predictably. Namely, we would see the largest

distributional effects where the largest mass of compliers is: around the mode of the distribution

of compliers. Therefore, any other pattern of results is indirect evidence of heterogeneous

treatment effects.

      Importantly, our two-stage least squares estimates of distributional effects are not likely

to be biased by heterogeneity in the first stage. There are two potential forms of first-state

heterogeneity for distributional effects: extensive- and intensive-margin heterogeneity.

Extensive-margin heterogeneity means that the fraction of individuals staying in school for

longer as a result of the 1972 ROSLA may vary depending on where in the health distribution

these individuals would have been absent the reform. For example, unhealthy individuals may

be more likely to be drop out of school at age 15 before the reform relative to their healthy

peers and therefore may be more likely to be “compliers” in this setting. Intensive-margin

heterogeneity means that, among compliers, one’s additional schooling associated with the

ROSLA may vary depending on where in the health distribution s/he would have been in the



                                                                                               27
absence of the reform. For example, healthy compliers may be more likely to stay in school for

greater than one year due to the ROSLA despite only being compelled to stay for one.

      Under the assumptions of the regression discontinuity design, extensive-margin

heterogeneity does not affect on our two-stage least squares estimates (see Appendix J). The

main intuition behind the proof is that two-stage least squares estimates of distributional effects

recover differences in the health distribution of only compliers, who, by definition, were all

affected by the policy. However, if there is heterogeneity on the intensive margin, the estimates

of the distributional effects will overweigh the treatment effects of those who stayed in school

longer. As a result, the largest distributional effects would not be observed at the mode of the

distribution of compliers; instead, the estimates would be biased toward the mode of

distribution of those who increased their schooling the most as a result of the ROSLA.

      In practice, it is unlikely that heterogeneity on the intensive margin could explain our

results. The main effect of the ROSLA was to keep in school until age 16 students who would

have dropped out by age 15 otherwise; the increase in the fraction of students staying in school

until at least age 17 as a result of the ROSLA is small: about 2 percentage points (compared to

15 percentage points at age 16, see Appendix K). Clark and Royer (2013) reach a similar

conclusion: “the 1972 change had small, at best, effects on the fractions completing 11 or fewer

years…To a first approximation therefore, one can view these law changes as forcing students

that would previously have left at the earliest opportunity to stay in school for one more year”

(pg. 2102). These suggest little scope for first-stage, intensive-margin heterogeneity in our

context.


       4. Distributional Effects of Education on Health


      Figure 4 shows the distributional treatment effects of education on body size. It shows

the pre- and post-reform CDFs of the body size index for compliers. As explained in Section




                                                                                                28
3, the pre-reform CDF is obtained by estimating (6) for each grid point ℎ and then plotting

𝛿𝛿̂0 (ℎ) against ℎ. 37 The discontinuity in the CDF, 𝜇𝜇(ℎ), is obtained by estimating (5) through

2SLS for each grid point ℎ. The post-reform CDF at a given grid point ℎ is obtained by adding

𝜇𝜇̂ (ℎ) “vertically” to 𝛿𝛿̂0 (ℎ).

      Figure 4 shows that education reduces body size: The post-reform CDF is shifted to the

left relative to the pre-reform CDF. Importantly, the shift is not parallel; the gains are

concentrated at the top of the distribution, among the least healthy. This result is consistent

with a Grossman-type model with diminishing marginal utility of health (Kippersluis and

Galama 2014). Staying in school until age 16 increases the fraction of study participants with

a body size index smaller than 1 standard deviation from 77.5% to 84.4%. Similarly, the 90th

percentile of the body size distribution decreases from 1.58 to 1.2 standard deviations. This

effect is 2.5 times the average treatment effect (on the treated) of -0.15 standard deviations

estimated in Table 2.

  Compliers are less healthy than always takers but not dramatically so. Appendix Figures D4, D5, and D6

our 3 indices.

     While Figure 4 has the advantage of graphically displaying the distributional treatment

effects in just one figure, it lacks the transparency of traditional RDD graphs. In Appendix

Figure B11, we present traditional RDD graphs for the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th

percentiles of the distribution of the body size index (of those born between September 1, 1956

and August 31, 1957). Appendix Figures B12 and B13 present corresponding graphs for the

lung function and blood pressure indices.

          Notes: The figure shows the pre- and post-reform CDFs of the lung function index for compliers. N = 215,366.




     Figure 5 shows that education also improves lung function: The post-reform CDF is

shifted to the left relative to the pre-reform CDF. Staying in school until age 16 increases the

fraction of study participants with a lung function index smaller than 1 standard deviation from

78.1% to 87.6%. Similarly, the 90th percentile of the lung function distribution decreases from

1.48 to 1.14 standard deviations. This effect is 2 times the average treatment effect (on the

treated) of -0.17 standard deviations estimated in Table 2.

      While Figures 4 and 5 show that education improves body size and lung function, Figure

6 shows that education worsens one dimension of health: it increases blood pressure. 38 The

post-reform CDF lies to the right of the pre-reform CDF. Staying in school until age 16

decreases the fraction of study participants with a blood pressure index smaller than 0 from

49.4% to 39.3%. Similarly, the 30th percentile of the blood pressure index distribution increases

from -0.49 to -0.16 standard deviations. This effect is 2.2 times the average treatment effect

(on the treated) of 0.15 standard deviations estimated in Table 2. This result is particularly

striking because blood pressure can be controlled through medication, diet, and exercise

(Chobanian et al. 2003), and there is a positive association between education and these healthy

behaviors (Park and Kang 2008; Conti, Heckman, and Urzua 2010; Cutler and Lleras-Muney

2010).


38
  The fraction of people with low blood pressure in our sample is negligible; in contrast, 30% are hypertensive
(see Figure 8). Therefore we interpret an increase in blood pressure as a worsening of health.


                                                                                                                           32
        A comparison of Figures 4 and 6 shows that not only the effect on the body size and blood

pressure indices have different signs, but the effects also happen in different parts of the

respective distributions. While the effects on body size occur in the upper part of the body size

distribution, the effects on blood pressure occur in the lower part of the blood pressure

distribution among the healthiest. Appendix Figures B5-B10 assess the sensitivity of Figures

5-7 to changing the bandwidth, using linear trends, and the inclusion of controls.

        To test whether these shifts in our health indices CDFs are significant and where they are

concentrated, we use distributional tests as described in section 3 above. The first row in Table

3 shows p-values of tests of the equality of the pre- and post-reform CDFs. The middle and

bottom rows show p-values of tests of the equality of the bottom half (i.e., the healthiest) and

the top half (i.e., the least healthy) of pre- and post-reform CDFs.

        We can reject the null for the top half of the body size distribution and for the bottom half

of the blood pressure distribution (at the 5% significance level). The p-value for the top half of

the lung function distribution is 0.0618. Appendix Tables B1-B3 assess the sensitivity of these

results to changing the bandwidth, using linear trends, and including controls. While the p-

values change across specifications, the main patterns remain: in most cases, we can reject the

null of equality for the top half of the body size distribution and for the bottom half of the blood

pressure distribution.

      Figures 7 and 8 shed light on these findings by plotting results for measures with clinical

thresholds. Figure 7 shows the pre- and post-reform CDFs of body mass index (for compliers).

Figure 8 shows the pre- and post-reform CDFs of diastolic blood pressure (for compliers). 39

         Figure 7 shows that the reductions in BMI caused by more education occur where they

matter the most: Staying in school until age 16 reduces obesity rates (i.e., the fraction of study

participants with a BMI below 30) by 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, Figure 8 shows that

the increase in blood pressure does not affect the prevalence of stage 2 hypertension (classified

as having a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg). Staying in school until age 16 increases

the probability of stage 1 hypertension (defined as having diastolic blood pressure between 80

mmHg and 90 mmHg; known as “prehypertension” before the 2017 redefinition) by 7.9

percentage points. 40




39
   Results for systolic blood pressure, omitted due to space constraints, are similar.
40
   Despite no change in stage 2 hypertension, the increase in the fraction of people in the stage 1 (formerly pre-
high) range might still mean a worsening of health, as observational studies indicate that death from both
ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke increases progressively and linearly from levels as low as 75mmHg
DBP (Lewington et al. 2002). In addition, longitudinal data have indicated that DBP between 85 and 89 mmHg
are associated with a more than twofold increase in relative risk from cardiovascular disease as compared to
those with DBP below 80mmHg (Vasan et al. 2001). However, stage 2 hypertension is more serious than stage
1: while medications are the main treatment for stage 2 hypertension, for stage 1 the focus is on lifestyle
changes (Bakris and Sorrentino 2018).


                                                                                                                34

       These results illustrate the importance of studying distributional effects. While the

average treatment effects show improvements in body size and deterioration in blood pressure,

the distributional effects reveal in which part of the distributions these changes occur. The

deterioration of blood pressure occurs with no observed consequences for the prevalence of

stage 2 hypertension. In contrast, the improvements in anthropometrics are concentrated at the

right tail, with a large reduction in obesity rates. These effects offer important information that

policy-makers might wish to trade-off when considering the health consequences of

educational policies.

       Our findings are not consistent with homogeneous treatment effects of education on

health. The main effect of the schooling reform was to induce students who would have

dropped out at age 15 (i.e., the compliers) to stay in school an additional year. Homogeneous

treatment effects do not imply a constant 𝜃𝜃1 (ℎ) for all ℎ in equation (5), or equivalently, a

parallel vertical shift in Figures 4-8. Rather, if this additional year of schooling affected the

health of all compliers equally, we would see effects across the whole support of the complier

distribution, with the largest effect at the mode of the pre-reform distribution. This is because,

when more people are near some threshold ℎ0 absent the reform, more people will cross the ℎ0

threshold after the reform is in place. Appendix I provides a formal proof.

       The results show a different pattern. Figures 4-8 indicate that our effects are limited to

some parts of the distributions of health of compliers. Indeed, the statistical tests in Table 3

cannot reject a null effect for the bottom half of the body size and lung function distributions

and the top half of the blood pressure distribution. Importantly, the effects we do find are not

concentrated around the modes of these distributions. For body size, they are concentrated

around the 78th percentile of the complier distribution (72nd percentile for lung function and

40th for blood pressure). These patterns imply heterogeneous effects of education on health.




                                                                                                36
        5. Channels


      One of the channels through which education may affect health is health behaviors.

Correlational evidence shows that the more educated are more likely to use preventive care,

that they manage chronic conditions more effectively, and that they are less likely to smoke

and drink heavily (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2008; Goldman and Smith 2002).

       Taking advantage of the richness of the UK Biobank data, we investigate whether

education has a causal effect on three types of health behaviors: diet, smoking, and physical

activity. Diet was measured using a 24-h dietary assessment tool self-completed through the

Internet (Galante et al. 2016). 41 Accelerometers worn for 7 days were used to measure physical

activity. 42 Smoking was self-reported.

       Appendix Table E4 shows the effects on diet. Staying in school until age 16 reduces the

intake of fat and saturated fat (as a fraction of total energy intake). There are, however, no

effects on total caloric intake, sugars, or carbohydrates. Appendix Table E5 shows no effects

on the measures of smoking and physical activity we have available. 43

        This analysis suggests that improved diet is an important channel through which

education reduces body size. Those who stayed in school until age 16 had better diets in middle

age – about 10% lower in fat and 15% lower in saturated fat. Even if the energy content of

   The Oxford WebQ collects information on the quantities of all foods and beverages consumed over the
previous day. Respondents are asked whether they consumed any of 21 food groups over the previous day. A
positive response results in the screen expanding to reveal a list of commonly consumed foods in the
corresponding category. Respondents then select the amount of each food consumed using standard categories
to indicate the amount consumed. Energy and nutrient values are generated by multiplying the quantity of each
food or drink consumed by its nutrient composition. The Oxford WebQ was included at the assessment visit of
the baseline measures for the last 70,724 participants and administered over the Internet to all UK Biobanks
participants with a known email address, who were invited to complete the Oxford WebQ on four separate
occasions over a 16-month period.
42
   Accelerometer data were collected from May 2013 until December 2015 from 103,720 UK Biobank
participants. Our outcome of interest is the average acceleration adjusted for no-wear bias (UKB field 90087):
http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=90087
43
   These are consistent with Clark and Royer (2013), who also find no effects of the 1972 ROSLA on self-
reported smoking or physical activity.


                                                                                                            37
one’s diet is held constant, changes in diet composition can affect body weight (Hall et al.

2012).

         The pathways are less clear for the harmful effect of education on blood pressure. We

find no effects on a (self-reported) measure of hypertension diagnosis 44 and on (current) blood

pressure medication (Appendix Table E5). One alternative hypothesis is that, by changing the

types of occupations and careers individuals have, education might have an effect on job

responsibilities, expectations, and work-related stress with negative implications for blood

pressure. 45 In the U.S. context, for example, academically successful African Americans have

higher biomarkers related to cardiometabolic risk (i.e. blood pressure and stress hormones)

than other groups (Brody et al. 2013, Miller et al. 2015, Chen et al. 2015). This is potentially

driven by stressors related to upward mobility, which could also be playing a role in the U.K

context. We have no credible data to test this hypothesis in the UK Biobank so we leave it for

future work.




44
  The wording of the question was “Have you been told by a doctor that you have high blood pressure”?
45
  Appendix Table E2 presents evidence that education increases the socioeconomic class of occupations
participants hold in middle age. They are less likely to work on semi-routine and lower supervisory occupations,
for example.


                                                                                                             38
       6. Conclusions


       In this paper, we investigate how education affects the distribution of health along three

dimensions: body size, lung function, and blood pressure. While the main take-away from

Clark and Royer (2013) is that education does not affect health, our results suggest a more

nuanced story. The distributional analysis shows that education does affect the health of some

subpopulations. We find, for example, that the school-leaving age reform shifted part of the

body size distribution to the left—i.e., it caused reductions in body size. Importantly, our results

do not rely on rank preservation assumptions and or on extensive-margin homogeneity in the

effects of the ROSLA on education (i.e., the first stage).

       Because the effects of the reform are concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution

rather than at the mode, this is evidence that the effect of education on body size is

heterogeneous. Indeed, in related work we show that the effect varies with one’s genetic

predisposition to obesity: the reductions in body size were larger for individuals at greater

genetic risk of obesity (Barcellos, Carvalho, and Turley 2018). These findings support Galama

et al. (2018)’s hypothesis that heterogeneity in the effects of education on health explain why

some studies find that more education causes better health while others find no effect.

       We conduct a back-of-envelope calculation to illustrate the importance of accounting

for the heterogeneity in the effects of education when evaluating its estimated impacts

(Heckman et al. 2016). Take, for example, the relationship between BMI and mortality. It is

U-shaped (Fogel 1994; Aune et al. 2016), suggesting that the reduction in mortality caused by

a given reduction in BMI is larger for someone obese than for someone with normal weight. A

reduction in average BMI of 0.4 caused by staying in school until age 16 (i.e., the average

treatment effect on the treated) implies a reduction in the relative risk of death of 0.85%—see

Appendix G for details. In contrast, the local distributional treatment effects yield a much larger




                                                                                                 39
reduction of 3.27%. That is because of the U-shaped relationship between BMI and mortality

and because the effects on BMI were concentrated at the upper tail of the BMI distribution.

       The effects of education on health may vary not only across people but also across

different health dimensions. Besides reducing body size, the school-leaving age reform

increased blood pressure. Education seems to have reduced body size through improvements

in SES and diet, but it is not clear the channels through which education increased blood

pressure. Interestingly, the improvement in body size was concentrated at the top half of the

body size distribution (among the least healthy) while the worsening in blood pressure was

concentrated at the bottom half of the blood pressure distribution (among the most healthy).

       These results underscore the policy relevance of studying distributional effects. Even

though the average treatment effects show a reduction in body size and an increase in blood

pressure of identical magnitudes (0.15 of a standard deviation), a policy maker may wish to

trade-off these effects based on which parts of the respective distributions are affected. Because

the reductions in BMI occurred at the upper tail of the BMI distribution, staying in school until

age 16 reduced obesity rates (i.e., BMI above 30) by 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, the

increase in blood pressure was concentrated below the clinical threshold for stage 2

hypertension (i.e., diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg or systolic blood pressure above

140) with no statistically significant consequences for prevalence.

Notes: The table investigates whether predetermined characteristics are smooth are around the September 1, 1957 cutoff. It reports the
coefficient on an indicator for being born on or after September 1, 1957 (i.e., “Post”) from regressions where the dependent variables is listed
in the column. The regressions also included quadratic polynomials in date of birth, which were allowed to differ on either side of the cutoff.
The mean of Y corresponds to the average of the dependent variable among those born in the 12 months before September 1, 1957.

Power to Detect Mean Effects Versus Distributional Effects

Introduction

In this section, we illustrate a case where an estimate of average treatment effects will be lower
powered than distributional treatment effects. More precisely, we examine a setting where only
individuals in the upper portion of the outcome distribution are responsive to treatment. We
calculate analytically the power to estimate the treatment effect on the average value of the
outcome in the population.

Due to the analytic and computation complexity of the Anderson-Darling-based test used in this
paper, we are unable to calculate the power of that test analytically nor by simulation. Instead,
we evaluate the power to measure the treatment effect on an indicator of whether the outcome
variable is above or below certain values at different parts of the outcome distribution. (See
details below.) While this is not a perfect comparison, it is meant to give intuition for when
distributional tests may perform better than tests of the average.

We find in this simplified setting that when most individuals are affected by some treatment,
estimates of average effects are better powered than estimates of distributional effects.
However, when fewer individuals are affected, distributional tests may be better powered.

Data Generating Process

Let Yi denote some outcome of interest for individual i. We are interested in the effect of some
treatment Xi on Yi, where Xi is an indicator variable of whether individual i was treated. Let Y0,i
denote the potential outcome of individual i in the case that they were not treated and Y1,i denote
the potential outcome of individual i in the case that they were.

To simulate distributional effects, we assume that only the top pτ fraction of the potential
outcome distribution is affected by treatment. More precisely, we assume that

                                               𝑌𝑌0,𝑖𝑖      if 𝑌𝑌0,𝑖𝑖 ≤ 𝜏𝜏
                                  𝑌𝑌1,𝑖𝑖 = �
                                            𝑌𝑌0,𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿   otherwise,

where τ is the (1- pτ)-th percentile of the potential outcome distribution, τ ≡ Φ-1(1- pτ), and δ is
the effect of treatment on those affected. To maintain monotonicity and simplify this derivation,
we assume that δ > 0.

In this exercise, we assume that we draw a sample of N individuals from the population, treat a
fraction px of them, and measure their realized outcome Yi. In the sections below, we calculate
the power to find a statistically significant effect of treatment by looking at the effect of
treatment on the average of the outcome and by looking at the effect of treatment on specific
parts of the outcome distribution.

The Distributional Test

Because the distributional test used in this paper is very complicated, both analytically and
computationally, it will not be possible to calculate the power of that test. We instead calculate
the power of an alternative but related test that is meant to provide intuition for why and under
which circumstances a distributional test may be better powered than a test of an average
treatment effect.


                                                                                                 60
Specifically, we will consider an indicator variable, Ti, for whether Yi is greater than some value
t, and calculate the power to detect an effect of the treatment on Ti. Recall that the distributional
test in this paper is a weighted integral of these treatments effects across a range of values of t.
Thus, if for the values of t in that range, the power of each corresponding test is greater than the
power to detect an effect on the average value of Yi, it is likely that the power of the distributional
test will similarly be greater.

Some Intermediate Calculations

In order to perform the power calculations below, we will need to know the values of E(Yi),
Var(Yi), E(Ti), and Var(Ti). We first calculate

                    E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) = P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0)E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0) + P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)

                                        = P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)

                                                    = 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿.

Next, we calculate

                  E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 ) = P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0)E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0) + P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)

                                    = (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1).

Note that the variable (Yi | Xi = 1) is the same as (Z + δ I) where Z is a standard normal random
variable and I is an indicator variable for whether Z > τ. We therefore continue

                                 E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 ) = (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 E[(𝑍𝑍 + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿)2 ]

                          = (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 [E(𝑍𝑍 2 ) + 2E(𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍)𝛿𝛿 + E(𝐼𝐼 2 )𝛿𝛿 2 ]

                               = (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 [1 + 2𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿 2 ]

                                       = 1 + 2𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿 2 ,

where φ(.) is the standard normal pdf. Finally, this implies that

                                        Var(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) = E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖2 ) − E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 )2

                               = 1 + 2𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿 2 − (𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿)2

                               = 1 + 2𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 )𝛿𝛿 2 .

For the binary variable, we first calculate

                    E(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ) = P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0)E(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0) + P(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)E(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1)

                             = (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )[1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡)] + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 [1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿)]

                                 = 1 − (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿).

This implies that


                                                                                                    61
         Var(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ) = [(1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿)][1 − (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿)].



Power to Detect Changes in the Average Outcome

To estimate the effect of treatment on average health, βavg, we regress Yi on Xi. In that case, we
see that

                                                          Cov(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 )
                                               𝛽𝛽avg =
                                                           Var(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 )

                                               E(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) − E(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 )E(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 )
                                           =
                                                           Var(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 )

                                                   𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 δ𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 − 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝛿𝛿𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥2
                                               =
                                                       𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )

                                                        = 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 δ.

Using the derivations from the previous section, the standard error an estimator of βavg is

                                                      Var(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) − Var�𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽avg �
                                SE�𝛽𝛽avg � = �
                                                              𝑁𝑁 Var(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 )


                                     1 + 2𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 )𝛿𝛿 2
                                =�                                                  .
                                                 𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )

From these expressions, we see that the z-statistic for the average effect will be distributed as

                                                    𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )
                          𝑁𝑁 �𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 δ�                                                  , 1�.
                                        1 + 2𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)𝛿𝛿 + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 )𝛿𝛿 2

So the power of a test of whether there is a non-zero mean effect of the policy will be equal to
the fraction of the time that this normally distributed random variable achieves a value greater
than 1.96 in magnitude.

Power to Detect Changes in the Distribution of the Outcome

Let Ti be defined for some threshold t, as described above. We first note that if t < τ, then the
treatment effect, βt, will be equal to zero since the treatment will not induce any individuals
below the threshold to cross the threshold. This means that power to estimate an effect of
treatment with a p-value of less than 0.05 is 5%.

We next consider that case that t > τ + δ. In this setting, every individual less than δ units below
the threshold t will be above the threshold after treatment. Therefore

                                  𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 = 𝐸𝐸(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0)

                                                                                                          62
                              = 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 > 𝑡𝑡|𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 1) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 > 𝑡𝑡|𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 0)

                                     = 1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿) − 1 + 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡)

                                            = 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡) − 𝛷𝛷(𝑡𝑡 − 𝛿𝛿)

                                                 = 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 ,

where pt ≡ Φ(t) is the fraction of individuals where Y0,i ≤ t.

The standard error is therefore

                                                    Var(𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ) − Var(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽t )
                                  SE(𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 ) = �
                                                         𝑁𝑁 Var(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 )


                                (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 )
                           =�                                                             .
                                                  𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )

This means the z-statistics for a test of a treatment effect on Ti is distributed


                                                        𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )
                𝑁𝑁 �(𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 )�                                                          , 1�.
                                      (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 )𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡−𝛿𝛿 )


As with the calculation of power in the average treatment effect-case, the power in this setting
is the fraction of time that this normally distributed random variable exceeds one in absolute
value.

We do not calculate the power of a test for values of t in [τ, τ + δ] but rather note that the power
will be somewhere between the cases when t is above or below this interval.

Illustration of Power Calculations in Various Settings

In this illustration, we compare the power of the estimates of the treatment on the average
outcome and the effect of the treatment on the binary outcomes. In these calculations, we set δ
= 0.025, which is approximately the same magnitude as the estimated average effect for all three
health indices in this paper. Qualitatively, the results of this illustration are the same at any
sample size, but we set N = 100,000 here because it makes the results easier to display. We set
px = 0.5.

In order to investigate our claim that distributional effects may be better powered when not
everyone is affected homogeneously by the treatment, we consider the cases pτ ϵ {0.25, 0.5,
0.75, 1}. We evaluate the power for the continuous and binary case for a dense range of values
of pt ϵ (0, 1). The results of these calculations are found in Appendix Figure 1 below.




                                                                                                        63

Discussion

Panel (a) corresponds to a setting when every individual is affected by the treatment
homogeneously. Unsurprisingly, the power of the average effect estimate is greater than the
power of the distributional effect estimate for all values of pt.

Panel (b) corresponds to a setting where only 25% of individuals are unaffected by the policy.
Note that for values of pt less than 0.25, the distributional effect has very low power, a result of
individuals in that part of the distribution being unaffected by the treatment. Nevertheless, over
a large interval of values for pt, the distributional test is slightly better powered than the test on
the average. The power of the distributional test quickly decays outside of this range however,
suggesting that a test that considers all values of pt in the range 0.5 to 1 (e.g., the Anderson-
Darling test used in this paper) may not be better powered than a test on the average.

In panel (c), however, where 50% of individuals are unaffected, the difference in power
becomes substantial over nearly the whole range of values in the upper half of the distribution.
This is particularly relevant to our setting because, observing the pre- and post-reform CDF of
body size index, it appears that the ROSLA affected only for those in the upper half of the
distribution.

The patterns in paned (d), with 75% of the population unaffected, are similar to those of the first
three panels. For the values of pt corresponding to affected individuals, the difference in power
                                                                                                   64
between the distributional and average effect is even larger, though the range of individuals who
are affected is much narrower than in the other panels.

This discussion shows how tests of distributional effects may be better powered than tests for
average effects in certain cases. Obviously, this framework is simplified in order to make the
math tractable, but the general principle will hold that when only a portion of the distribution is
affected by some treatment, methods that focus on those segments of the distribution may be
better powered than those that consider the whole distribution. This appears to be increasingly
true as the fraction affected becomes smaller.

             66
We conducted a back-of-envelope calculation to estimate the mortality consequences of the
estimated reduction in BMI caused by staying in school until age 16. To map BMI into
mortality, we used Aune et al. (2016)’s estimates of the association between BMI and all cause
mortality. In particular, we used the estimates from the column “All participants” of Table 2.

In the first step, we fitted a fractional polynomial of second order through the points in Table 2
in order to obtain a continuous mapping of relative mortality as a function of BMI. A fractional
polynomial is a polynomial that may include logarithms, noninteger powers, and repeated
powers. Here is the Stata output from this estimation:




where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 is the relative mortality and 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵_1 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 −2 and 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵_2 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 3 .

     � (𝑥𝑥) be the predicted relative risk of death for an individual with a BMI of 𝑥𝑥.

In the second step, we estimated the vintiles of the distribution of BMI among the compliers
born between September 1, 1956 and August 31, 1957, where compliers are defined as those
born before the reform who dropped out of school at age 15 and younger. These vintiles define
the grid used to estimate the pre- and the post-reform cumulative distribution functions of BMI.



                                                                                               67
In the third step, we estimated 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝜏𝜏) and 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝜏𝜏) at each vintile 𝜏𝜏 (following the procedure
explained in Section 3 of the paper).

In the fourth step estimated, we estimated the pre- and post-reform relative risk of death:

�� �𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝� − 1� ∗ 100 is the estimated reduction in mortality associated with our distributional
  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
treatment effects.


To calculate the reduction in mortality implied by the average treatment effect, we first
estimated the average BMI for compliers born at September 1, 1957. To do that, we restricted
the sample to participants born before September 1, 1957 who dropped out of school at age 15
or younger and run a regression of BMI on quadratic trends for date of birth. The coefficient on
the constant, 28.51707, is our estimate of the pre-reform average BMI among compliers. Next,
we estimated the 2SLS effect of staying in school until age on BMI, -.4066152. The post-reform
average BMI among compliers is equal to 28.1104548 = 28.51707-.4066152. Finally, the
                                                    � (28.1104548 )

    We used genetic data to re-weight the UK Biobank (UKB) sample in an attempt to make it
nationally representative. Genetic data may be useful in this regard because it is fixed at
conception. We used the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA) as a nationally
representative benchmark. We restricted both samples to individuals of European ancestry in
each data set who were born in the years 1954-1959.
    We use a polygenic score (PGS) for educational attainment (EA) to compare the two
samples. A PGS is a weighted sum of molecular genetic markers called single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). The weights for this PGS are based on a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of EA (Lee et al. 2018) and are derived using a standard procedure, LDpred
(Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015). A PGS for EA constructed in this way reduces dimensionality of the
genetic data while still maximizing its predictive power. This PGS has been shown to explain
11-13% of the variation in EA, slightly less than the variation explained by a parent's EA (Lee
et al. 2018).
    To compare the distribution of the EA PGS between the ELSA and UKB samples, it is
important to construct the polygenic score from the same set of SNPs. The ELSA sample
contains imputed genotypes for 39,131,557 SNPs. The UKB sample contains 16,642,384
imputed SNPs. In order to include only those SNPs that are well-imputed, we restrict SNPs in
the ELSA sample with Rsq values of exactly 1, where Rsp is a measure of imputation quality
between 0 and 1. Due to computational constraints, we were unable to include an imputation
quality criterion on the UKB sample. Keeping only SNPs that are in the intersection of the UKB
sample, ELSA sample, and the GWAS summary statistics, we are left with 281,700 SNPs. The
PGS is constructed based on this set of SNPs.
    Appendix Figure H5 shows the distribution of the polygenic score in the two samples.

To create weights, the distribution of scores is divided into 512 evenly-spaced points. At each
point, the weight equals the ratio of the density of UKB observations to the density of ELSA
observations. Then, for each individual in the UKB, we find the score distribution point
nearest to the individual’s score, and assign the weight associated with this point as the
individual’s weight.

Notes: The table shows the effects of the school reform on education. Each cell corresponds to a separate regression. We report the coefficient
on the indicator variable for being born on or after September 1, 1957 (i.e., “Post”). The dependent variable mean in the bottom row is the
weighted mean among those born in the 12 months before September 1, 1957. Controls include male, age in days and age squared, dummies
for calendar month of birth, dummies for ethnicity, and dummies for country of birth. Robust standard errors. N = 264,066. The estimates in
the first and third columns are slightly different from the estimates in Table 1 in the paper because the sample here is restricted to those of
European ancestry in the UK Biobank who were genotyped.

Implications of Homogeneous Effects on Distribution Effect Estimates

In this section, we will show that distributional effects behave predictably if there are
homogeneous treatment effects. We begin by defining “distributional effects” with respect to
the potential outcome distributions of compliers. For some outcome, 𝑦𝑦, let 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦) denote the
potential-outcome cumulative distribution function (CDF) of y for the set of compliers absent
the policy, and let 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,1 (𝑦𝑦) denote the potential-outcome CDF of y for the set of compliers
with the policy. If compliers all get exactly one additional year of school as a result of the
policy, the distributional effect of an additional year of school in compliers is
                                        𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦) = 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,1 (𝑦𝑦) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦).

Notably, homogeneous treatment effects of a policy does not imply that for all 𝑦𝑦, 𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦) is
constant. Rather, they imply that 𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦) is largest in parts of the distribution where 𝑦𝑦 is most
concentrated. This is because if every person is affected equally by some policy, more people
will cross some threshold 𝑦𝑦0 if there are more people near the 𝑦𝑦0 threshold.

More formally, if a policy affects every individual by some constant, 𝜇𝜇. Then 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,1 (𝑦𝑦) =
𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇). This means that
                                           𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦) = 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,1 (𝑦𝑦) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦)
                                            = 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦).
Recall that the definition of a derivative is
                                                          𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥 + 𝜇𝜇)
                                      𝑓𝑓 ′ (𝑥𝑥) = lim                          .
                                                    ε→0              𝜀𝜀
So for small 𝜇𝜇, we have
                                       𝛽𝛽(𝑦𝑦) = 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦)
                                                𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦)
                                           = 𝜇𝜇
                                                               𝜇𝜇
                                                𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦) − 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0 [𝑦𝑦 + (−𝜇𝜇)]
                                     = (−𝜇𝜇)
                                                                  𝜇𝜇
                                                               ′ (𝑦𝑦)
                                                   ≈ −𝜇𝜇 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0
                                                   = −𝜇𝜇 𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦),
                       ′ (𝑦𝑦)
where 𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐,0 (𝑦𝑦) ≡ 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐,0    is the probability density function of 𝑦𝑦 in compliers absent the policy.
So we see that, if there are homogeneous treatment effects, the distributional effects would be
approximately proportionate to the distribution of compliers.




                                                                                                    77

Robustness to Extensive-Margin Heterogeneity in the First Stage

In this section we will show that our two-stage least squares estimates of distributional effects
are not biased by extensive-margin heterogeneity in the first stage (see section 3 in the main
paper for a definition of extensive- and intensive- margin heterogeneity in our context).

Imagine we are studying some policy that raises the schooling of a fraction of the population by
exactly one year. Use π to denote the fraction of the population of “compliers.” (i.e., those whose
education is increased by a year when this policy is implemented.) We are interested in the
effect of an additional year of schooling on some outcome, y (e.g., BMI), in compliers.

We begin by defining “distributional effects” with respect to the potential outcome distributions
of compliers. Let Fc,0 (y) denote the potential-outcome cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of y for the set of compliers absent the policy, and let Fc,1 (y) denote the potential-outcome
CDF of y for the set of compliers with the policy. Since compliers all get exactly one additional
year of school as a result of the policy, the distributional effect of an additional year of school
in compliers is

                                   β (y) = Fc,1 (y) − Fc,0 (y) .

The function β (y) is the estimand of our two-stage least squares problem.

Next, we will show that under general conditions, two stage least squares obtains an estimate
of β (y), even if the first stage is heterogeneous in y. Let Fa,0 (y) denote the potential-outcome
CDF of y for the set of always- and never-takers absent the policy, and let Fa,1 (y) denote the
potential-outcome CDF of y for the set of always- and never-takers with the policy. By
construction, always- and never-takers are not affected by the policy, and therefore Fa,0 (y) =
Fa,1 (y). Notably, we make no assumptions about the size of the first stage in different parts of
the outcome distribution. It could be that there is a very large proportion of always-takers in the
lower tail of the distribution of y and small proportion of always-takers in the upper tail, which
would imply that the first stage is much bigger in the upper tail that the lower tail.

In practice, we cannot identify compliers in our data. We only can see the distribution of
outcomes in the whole population. That is, without the policy, we observe the population
outcome distribution

                              F0 (y) = πFc,0 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,0 (y) .

With the policy, we observe the population outcome distribution

                              F1 (y) = πFc,1 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,1 (y) .

In this framework, the First Stage is equal to the fraction of compliers in the entire population,
βFS = π. The Reduced Form is the difference in the outcome distribution with and without the
policy in the whole population

                                   βRF (y) ≡ F1 (y) − F0 (y)
                = [πFc,1 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,1 (y)] − [πFc,0 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,0 (y)]
                = [πFc,1 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,1 (y)] − [πFc,0 (y) + (1 − π) Fa,1 (y)]
                                   = π [Fc,1 (y) − Fc,0 (y)] .


                                                                                                79
Our Two-Stage Least Squares estimate is then the ratio of the Reduced Form and First Stage
estimates

                                    βTSLS (y) = βRF (y)/ βFS
                                  = π [Fc,1 (y) − Fc,0 (y)]/ π

which the distributional effect of an additional year of schooling on compliers. Therefore, two-
stage least squares obtains true distributional-effect estimates even when there is a
heterogeneous first stage.

Notes: The table shows the effects of the school reform on education. Each cell corresponds to a separate regression. We report the coefficient on

the indicator variable for being born on or after September 1, 1957 (i.e., “Post”). The dependent variable mean in the bottom row is the weighted

mean among those born in the 12 months before September 1, 1957. Controls include male, age in days and age squared, dummies for calendar

month of birth, dummies for ethnicity, and dummies for country of birth. Robust standard errors. N = 271,082.
