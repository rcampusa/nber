The Mirage of Exchange Rate Regimes for Emerging Market Countries
Guillermo A. Calvo and Frederic S. Mishkin
NBER Working Paper No. 9808

JEL No. F3, F4, E5

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper argues that much of the debate on choosing an exchange rate regime misses the boat. It
begins by discussing the standard theory of choice between exchange rate regimes, and then explores
the weaknesses in this theory, especially when it is applied to emerging market economies. It then
discusses a range of institutional traits that might predispose a country to favor either fixed or
floating rates, and then turns to the converse question of whether the choice of exchange rate regime
may favor the development of certain desirable institutional traits. The conclusion from the analysis
is that the choice of exchange rate regime is likely to be of second order importance to the
development of good fiscal, financial, and monetary institutions in producing macroeconomic
success in emerging market countries. This suggests that less attention should be focused on the
general question whether a floating or a fixed exchange rate is preferable, and more on these deeper
institutional arrangements. A focus on institutional reforms rather than on the exchange rate regime
may encourage emerging market countries to be healthier and less prone to the crises that we have
seen in recent years.

       In recent years, a number of emerging market countries have experienced devastating

financial crises and macroeconomic turbulence, including Argentina (2001-2002), Turkey (2000-

2001), Ecuador (1999), Russia (1998), east Asia (1997), Mexico (1994-95), and even Chile (1982).

In the ensuing post-mortems, an active debate has followed over how the choice of exchange rate

regime might have contributed to macroeconomic instability – and conversely, how a shift in

exchange rate regime might contribute to improved macroeconomic performance. Should an

emerging market economy prefer a floating exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate, or some blend

of the two like an exchange rate that was usually fixed but might sometimes shift?

       Many countries used to choose an intermediate path: that is, an exchange rate that was

often stabilized by the central bank, but might sometimes shift, often known as a “soft peg.”

However, in the aftermath of the macroeconomic crisis across east Asia in 1997-98, a view emerged

that this exchange rate regime was in part responsible for the depth of the macroecononomic

crisis. The governments of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, and other nations in that region had

kept exchange rates fixed. There was no explicit institutional guarantee that the exchange rate

would remain fixed, but the rates had been stable for long enough that local financial institutions

borrowed in dollars abroad and then loaned freely in U.S. dollars to domestic borrowers. But

when a surge of foreign investment stopped, the existing exchange rate became unsustainable.

For example, when the Thai baht collapsed against the U.S. dollar, Thai borrowers were

completely unable to repay their dollar-denominated loans – and in turn Thai financial

institutions were nearly all insolvent. This meltdown of the financial sector led to an enormous

economic contraction.




                                                 2
        Thus, one often-told lesson of the east Asian experience is that nations must make a

bipolar choice: either choose a framework for credibly guaranteeing a fixed exchange rate,

known as a “hard peg,” or else accept a freely floating exchange rate.1 Yet neither of these

extreme exchange rate regimes has an unblemished record.

        There are two basic ways a government can offer a credible guarantee of a fixed exchange

rate: a currency board and full dollarization. In a currency board the note-issuing authority, whether

the central bank or the government, fixes a conversion rate for this currency vis-à-vis a foreign

currency (say U.S. dollars) and provides full convertibility because it stands ready to exchange

domestically issued notes for the foreign currency on demand and has enough international reserves

to do so. Full dollarization involves eliminating the domestic currency altogether and replacing it

with a foreign currency like the U.S. dollar, which is why it is referred to as dollarization, although it

could instead involve the use of another currency like the euro. This commitment is even stronger

than a currency board because it makes it much more difficult -- though not impossible -- for the

government to regain control of monetary policy and/or set a new parity for the (nonexistent)

domestic currency.

        Argentina, for example, chose the currency board approach for ensuring a fixed exchange

rate. Indeed, Argentina even recognized that full backing of the monetary base may not be

enough, because that would leave the banking system without a lender of last resort or a situation

where the government might need additional credit, so the Argentines also paid for contingent

credit lines. From a legal perspective, the central bank of Argentina was highly independent. But in

2001, large budget deficits (including contingent government obligations, like supporting state-

owned banks) forced the Argentine government to look for a new source of funds. After Domingo

Cavallo became Minister of the Economy in April 2001, the supposedly independent central bank

president, Pedro Pou, was forced to resign. Soon after, Argentina’s prudential and regulatory regime

for its financial sector, which had been one of the best in the emerging market world, was weakened.

Banks were encouraged and coerced into purchasing Argentine government bonds to fund the fiscal

debt. An attempt was made to reactivate the economy via expansive monetary policy. With the

value of these bonds declining as the likelihood of default on this debt increased, bank's net worth

plummeted. The likely insolvency of the banks then led to a classic run on the banks and a full-scale

banking crisis by the end of 2001. Because most debt instruments in Argentina were denominated

in U.S. dollars, the depreciation of the Argentinean currency made it impossible for borrowers to

earn enough Argentinean currency to repay their dollar-denominated loans. The Argentine

financial sector melted down, and the economy as well. Argentina’s experiment with its

currency board ended up in disaster.

       The remaining option of freely floating exchange rates seems unattractive as well. Without

further elaboration, “floating exchange rate” means really nothing other than that the regime will

allow for some exchange rate flexibility. It rules out a fixed exchange rate regime but nothing else.

A country that allows a floating exchange rate may pursue a number of very different monetary

policy strategies: for example, targeting the money supply, targeting the inflation rate, or a

discretionary approach in which the nominal anchor is implicit but not explicit (the “just do it

approach”, described in Mishkin, 1999b, 2000 and Bernanke et al., 1999). But regardless of the




                                                   4
choice of monetary regime, in many emerging market economies, exports, imports, and

international capital flows are a relatively large share of the economy, so large swings in the

exchange rate can cause very substantial swings in the real economy. Even a central bank that would

prefer to let the exchange rate float must be aware that, if the country’s banks have made loans in

U.S. dollars, then a depreciation of the currency vs. the dollar can greatly injure the financial system.

Under these circumstances, the monetary authority is likely to display “fear of floating” (Calvo

and Reinhart, 2002), defined as a reluctance to allow totally free fluctuations in the nominal or

real exchange rate, which Mussa (1986) showed are very closely linked.

        Thus, the literature on exchange rate regimes seems to have backed itself into a corner where

none of the available options is without problems. In this paper, we argue that much of the debate on

choosing an exchange rate regime misses the boat. We will begin by discussing the standard theory

of choice between exchange rate regimes, and then explore the weaknesses in this theory, especially

when it is applied to emerging market economies. We discuss a range of institutional traits that

might predispose a country to favor either fixed or floating rates, and then turn to the converse

question of whether the choice of exchange rate regime may favor the development of certain

desirable institutional traits. Overall, we believe that the key to macroeconomic success in emerging

market countries is not primarily their choice of exchange rate regime, but rather the health of the

countries fundamental macroeconomic institutions, including the institutions associated with fiscal

stability, financial stability and monetary stability. In general, we believe that less attention should

be focused on the general question whether a floating or a fixed exchange rate is preferable, and

more on these deeper institutional arrangements.

The Standard Theory of Choosing an Exchange Rate Regime



       Much of the analysis of choosing an exchange rate regime has taken place using the

theory of optimal exchange rate regimes -- and its close relative the theory of optimal currency

areas -- which owes much to Mundell (1961) and Poole (1970). Models of choosing an

exchange rate regime typically evaluate such regimes by how effective they are in reducing the

variance of domestic output in an economy with sticky prices.

       If an economy faces primarily nominal shocks – that is, shocks that arise from money

supply or demand – then a regime of fixed exchange rates looks attractive. If a monetary shock

causes inflation, it will also tend to depreciate a floating exchange rate and thus transmit a

nominal shock into a real one. In this setting, the fixed exchange rate provides a mechanism to

accommodate a change in the money demand or supply with less output volatility.

       On the other hand, if the shocks are real – like a shock to productivity, or to the terms of

trade (that is, the relationship between export prices and import prices shifts due to movements

in demand or supply) – then exchange rate flexibility of some sort becomes appealing. In this

case, the economy needs to respond to a change in relative equilibrium prices, like the relative

price of tradables with respect to nontradables. A shift in the nominal exchange rate offers

speedy way of implementing such a change -- thus, ameliorating the impact of these shocks on




                                                  6
output and employment (De Grauwe, 1997). On the other hand, if a downturn is driven by real

factors in an economy with a fixed exchange rate, the demand for domestic money falls and the

central bank is forced to absorb excess money supply in exchange for foreign currency. The

result is that (under perfect capital mobility) the decrease in the demand for domestic money

leads to an automatic outflow of hard currency and a rise in interest rates. In this case, the hard

peg contributes to increasing the depth of the downturn.

       This standard model of choosing an exchange rate regime offers some useful insights.

However, it ultimately fails to address a challenge issued by Mundell himself in his original

1961 paper and many of the underpinnings of the model do not apply especially well to

emerging market economies.



The Mundell Challenge

       In Robert Mundell’s original 1961 paper on optimum currency areas, Mundell pointed

out that this theory implies that the optimality of fixed exchange rates within a given country

cannot be taken for granted. Why should Texas and New York in the United States, or Tucuman

and Buenos Aires in Argentina, share the same currency? These regions are hit by different real

shocks and would, according to the standard theory, benefit by the extra degree of freedom

provided by having their own currencies and allow them to float against each other. We will call

this deep observation the “Mundell challenge.”

       The usual response to the Mundell challenge is that a country has internal mechanisms

that can substitute for regional exchange rate variability, including labor mobility between




                                                  7
regions and compensatory fiscal transfers from the central government. However, these

arguments are only partially persuasive. Fiscal transfers, in contrast to currency devaluation, do

not change relative prices. Moreover, labor mobility is a poor substitute for exchange rate

flexibility. Imagine the social costs of having to ship people from Texas to New York, when a

simple movement in the exchange rate would have restored equilibrium.

       Indeed, the Mundell challenge cuts even more deeply. After all, why should exchange

rate flexibility be limited to large regions like New York or Texas? Why not have differing

exchange rates between cities, or neighborhoods? Indeed, why not move to a world of complete

contingent contracts, with no money at all, and thus in effect have a different flexible exchange

rate for every transaction? Of course, no one has pushed the theory to this implausible extreme.

However, not doing so implies acknowledging the existence of other factors that are key and,

actually, dominate the factors emphasized by the theory of exchange rate regimes.

       An important set of such factors relate to the observation that modern economies have

not yet been able to function without some kind of money. The fundamental functions of money

are to reduce transactions costs and to address liquidity concerns, functions which are especially

valuable in a world with seriously incomplete state-contingent markets. A common currency is a

useful coordinating mechanism within a national economy, even if it can sometimes go awry.

Similarly, a fixed exchange rate may be a useful mechanism for an economy, even if that country

faces differential real shocks, because the gains from reducing transactions costs and providing

liquidity are great enough. Thus, in choosing an exchange rate regime, it is not enough to

analyze the nature of the shocks. The potential benefits from fixed exchange rates must be taken




                                                 8
into account, too.



The Realities of Emerging Market Economies

       The standard framework for choosing an exchange rate regime is based on a number of

implicit assumptions that do not apply well to many emerging economies. The standard theory

presumes an ability to set up institutions that will assure a fixed exchange rate, but after the

experience of Argentina, this assumption of an institutional guarantee seems improbable. The

standard theory assumes that a time-consistent choice is made on the exchange rate regime, when

in many countries the exchange rate regime may frequently shift. In the standard model of

exchange rate choices, the focus is on adjustments in goods and labor markets and the financial

sector is thoroughly ignored. However, no recent macroeconomic crisis in an emerging market

has been free from financial turmoil of one form or another. Finally, as mentioned a moment

ago, the standard exchange rate model pays no attention to transaction costs and liquidity

considerations that are essential to explain why money should exist in the first place. This issue

is especially severe for emerging market economies, where the lack of contingent contracts is

more severe than in advanced economies.

       To illustrate the shortcomings of the standard model of choosing an exchange rate regime

for emerging markets, and also to highlight some of the main issues in making such a choice, it

is useful to identify several institutional features that are common in emerging market

economies: weak fiscal, financial, and monetary institutions; currency substitution and liability

dollarization: and vulnerability to sudden stops of outside capital flows.




                                                  9
        Weak fiscal, financial and monetary institutions make emerging market countries highly

vulnerable to high inflation and currency crises. A key lesson from the “unpleasant monetarist

arithmetic” discussed in Sargent and Wallace (1981) and the recent literature on fiscal theories of the

price level (Woodford, 1994 and 1995) is that irresponsible fiscal policy puts pressure on the

monetary authorities to monetize the debt, thereby producing rapid money growth, high inflation and

downward pressure on the exchange rate. Similarly, poor regulation and supervision of the financial

system can result in large losses in bank balance sheets that make it impossible for the monetary

authorities to raise interest rates to control inflation or prop up the exchange rate because doing so

would likely lead to a collapse of the financial system. Also a frail banking system can produce

fiscal instability, and hence high inflation and devaluations, because the need for a bailout can imply

a huge unfunded government liability (Burnside, Eichengreen and Rebelo, 2001). Weak monetary

institutions in which there is little commitment to the goal of price stability or the independence of

the central bank mean that the monetary authorities will not have the support or the tools to keep

inflation under control or to prevent large depreciations of the currency. Thus in

an economy where the government may run up enormous fiscal deficits, banks are poorly

regulated, and the central bank may recklessly expand the money supply, the real value of money

cannot be taken for granted.

        Firms and individuals in emerging market countries react to the threat that their money

may dramatically change in value – either through inflation or the exchange rate – by turning to

currency substitution, where they use a foreign currency for many transactions (Calvo and Végh,

1996). Currency substitution is likely to be due not only to past inflationary experience resulting




                                                   10
from weak monetary, fiscal and financial institutions,.but also to the fact that a currency like the

U.S. dollar is a key unit of account for international transactions. This phenomenon induces the

monetary authority to allow banks to offer foreign exchange deposits – that is, a firm in

Argentina can deposit U.S. dollars directly in an Argentine bank without converting to local

currency.2

        Foreign exchange deposits induce banks—partly for regulatory reasons that prevent

banks from taking exchange rate risk—to offer loans denominated in foreign currency, usually

U.S. dollars, leading to what is called liability dollarization. Liability dollarization leads to an

entirely different impact of a sharp currency devaluation in an emerging market (Mishkin, 1996;

Calvo, 2001). In emerging market countries, a sharp real currency depreciation creates a

situation where those who have borrowed in U.S. dollars are unable to repay. The money they

are earning is in local currency, but their debts are in U.S. dollars. Thus the net worth of

corporations and individuals falls, especially those whose earnings are primarily in local

currency. The result is many bankruptcies and loan defaults, a sharp decline in lending and an

economic contraction. Liability dollarization may become a major problem for countries where

the level of dollar borrowing has been especially high and where the economy is relatively

closed so that most parties earn only in local currency, as has recently been the case in several

emerging market countries (see Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi, 2002). However, not all emerging

market countries suffer from liability dollarization in a serious way; for example, Chile and


        2
          In this fashion, a sudden switch away from domestic and into foreign money need not result in
a bank run, since in the presence of foreign exchange deposits, such a portfolio shift could be
implemented by simply changing the denomination of bank deposits. Otherwise, deposits would be
drawn down to purchase foreign exchange, resulting in a bank run.




                                                  11
South Africa, which have stronger monetary, fiscal and financial institutions, are commonly

cited exceptions (Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza, 2002).

        Vulnerability to large negative changes in capital inflows, which often have a largely

unanticipated component (Calvo and Reinhart, 2000), also contribute to susceptibility to

currency and financial crises. Table 1 shows the incidence of these “sudden stops” over the last

decade. Table 1 shows that this phenomenon is mostly confined to emerging market countries

and is more likely to be associated with large currency devaluations in these countries, probably

because of their weak fiscal and financial institutions. (The precise definition of a sudden stop

and large devaluations are found in the note to the table.) In addition, preliminary evidence

suggests that there is a high degree of bunching of sudden stops across emerging market

countries. This is especially evident after the Russian 1998 crisis, and the recent Wall Street

scandals that included Enron and other firms. This pattern leads us to conjecture that, to a large

extent, sudden stops have been a result of factors somewhat external to emerging market

countries as a group. In this symposium, Kaminsky and Reinhardt discuss how the process of

contagion occurs.

        The links from weak institutions and sudden stops to currency substitution and liability

dollarization – and then the links from liability dollarization to a collapse balance sheets and

economic downturn – naturally differ from country to country.3 But currency depreciations and


3
  Among the factors that differ across countries, we would like to mention the problem of tax evasion.
As a result of tax evasion, the tax base of many emerging market economies is very small, the informal
sector large and, thus, any adjustment to shocks causes major distortion in the formal part of the economy,
leading to capital flight. Effects could be large if resulting externalities give rise to multiple equilibria
(Calvo, 2002).




                                                     12
sudden stops bring about large changes in relative prices, and have a deep impact on income

distribution and wealth (Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi, 2002). In addition, the sudden stop is

typically associated with a sharp fall in growth rates if not outright collapse in output and

employment. A floating exchange rate is clearly the wrong prescription for this situation, since it

allows the sharp depreciation that cripples balance sheets and the financial sector. But under the

dual stresses of weak institutions and sudden stops, it is not clear that a fixed exchange rate is

sustainable, either. Rather than focusing on the choice of exchange rate regime, the appropriate

answer to this situation would seem to be an improvement in fiscal, financial, and monetary

institutions. Such an improvement would limit the amount of currency substitution and liability

dollarization, and also make the economy more resilient in reacting to sudden stops when they

occur. In other (more graphic) words, “it’s the institutions stupid.”



Choosing Between Exchange Rate Regimes



       No exchange rate regime can prevent macroeconomic turbulence. But the choice of

exchange rate regime can be better or worse suited to the economic institutions and

characteristics of an economy. In the discussion that follows, we will focus primarily on the

overall choice between fixed and floating exchange rates. However, it is worth remembering that

exchange rate regimes come in a wide variety of arrangements: currency boards, dollarization,

soft pegs, crawling bands, free floating, and many others. Moreover, a floating exchange rate

regime can be accompanied by a number of different domestically oriented monetary policies




                                                 13
(inflation targeting, monetary targeting, or a “just do it” discretionary approach.)



The Ability to Have Domestic Monetary Policy

       The strongest argument in favor of a floating exchange rate regime is that it retains the

flexibility to use monetary policy to focus on domestic considerations. In contrast, a hard

exchange rate peg leaves very narrow scope for domestic monetary policy, because the interest

rate is determined by monetary policy in the anchor country to which the emerging market

country has pegged. However, in emerging market economies, this argument is more relevant in

some institutional contexts than others.

       One difficulty that emerging market economies face is that their capital markets are

geared to interest rates set in major financial centers.   Frankel, Schmukler and Serven (2002)

show, for example, that in Latin America all interest rates reflect changes in U.S. interest rates

and, furthermore, that countries that do not peg to the dollar see their interest rates change by a

larger factor than those that do. In addition, emerging market economies may be hit as a group

with financial contagion, as noted earlier, which will affect their interest rates. The central bank

in an emerging market country thus faces real practical difficulties.

       Moreover, although a floating exchange rate raises the theoretical possibility for domestic

monetary authorities to pursue countercyclical monetary policy, the central bank may not

possess this capability in practice. If the monetary authorities have little credibility in terms of

their commitment to price stability, then monetary policy may be ineffective. For a central bank

without inflation-fighting credibility, an expansionary monetary policy will only lead to an




                                                 14
immediate jump in interest rates and/or the price level.

        Building credible monetary institutions is a difficult task. It requires a public and

institutional commitment to price stability. Some of this commitment can be expressed through laws

and rules that assure the central bank will be allowed to set the monetary policy instruments without

interference from the government, that the members of the monetary policy board must be insulated

from the political process, and that the central bank is prohibited from funding government deficits.

There is a large literature on the forms that central bank independence can take (for example,

Cukierman, 1992), but what is written down in the law may be less important than the political

culture and history of the country. The contrast between Argentina and Canada is instructive here.

Legally, the central bank of Canada does not look particularly independent. In the event of a

disagreement between the Bank of Canada and the government, the minister of finance can issue a

directive that the bank must follow. However because the directive must be specific and in writing,

and because the Bank of Canada is a trusted public institution, a government override of the bank is

likely to cost the ruling party heavily in the polls. Thus, in practice the Bank of Canada is highly

independent. In contrast, the central bank of Argentina was highly independent from a legal

perspective. However, this did not stop the Argentine government from forcing the resignation of

the highly respected president of the central bank and replacing him with a president who would do

the government's bidding. It is unimaginable in countries like Canada, the United States or in

Europe, that the public would tolerate the removal of the head of the central bank in such a manner,

and indeed we do not know of any case of this happening in recent history.4


4
  The stability of the central bank in advanced countries may be partly explained by the size of the shocks,
rather than by some advantage in the political culture. After all, except for the Great Depression,




                                                    15
        Many emerging market countries, like Argentina, have had a history of poor support for the

price stability goal, and laws supporting central bank independence in these countries are easily

overturned. It is therefore important for such countries to develop genuine public and political

support for central bank independence as well as legal independence in order to have the ability to

successfully conduct domestic monetary policy.

        If an emerging market country is able to develop fiscal, financial and monetary institutions

that provide credibility for society’s pursuit of price stability, then monetary policy can be used to

stabilize the economy. Still, not all emerging market countries are up to this task, and so they may

decide to choose a hard exchange rate peg instead. (However, the absence of strong institutions may

make it difficult for them to sustain the hard peg.)

        This interdependence between institutions and exchange rate regimes helps to explain the

general empirical finding that whether a country has a fixed or flexible exchange rate tells us little

about whether it has higher economic growth or smaller output fluctuations. Indeed, when you look

more closely at which emerging market countries have successful macroeconomic performance, the

exchange rate regime appears to be far less important than deeper institutional features of the

economy relating to fiscal stability, financial stability and the credibility of monetary institutions that

promote price stability.5 However, there is some evidence that floating exchange rate regimes can


advanced countries have not been hit by equally large shocks as in Argentina and other emerging market
economies.
5
  Indeed, Tommasi (2002) has argued that even deeper institutions, relating to politico-institutional rules
as reflected in the constitution, electoral rules and informal practices of the polity, are crucial to the
development and sustainability of strong fiscal, financial and monetary institutions. Also, Acemoglu,
Johnson, Robinson and Thaicharoen (2003) provide evidence that deeper, fundamental institutions are
more crucial to lowering economic volatility and raising growth than are specific macroeconomic
policies.

help countries cope with terms-of-trade shocks and might promote economic growth (Broda, 2001

and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenneger, 2003).



Reducing Inflation

        Just as the main advantage of a floating exchange rate may be that it allows the monetary

authorities some discretion and flexibility to use monetary policy to cope with shocks to the

domestic economy, the main weakness of a floating exchange rate may be that it allows too much

discretion to monetary policy and so may not provide a sufficient nominal anchor (for example,

Calvo, 2001; Calvo and Mendoza, 2000).

        Of course, many emerging market countries have been able to keep inflation under control

with flexible exchange rate regimes and this is why the evidence on whether fixed versus floating

exchange rate regimes are associated with lower inflation rates on average is not clear cut (e.g.,

Edwards and Magendzo, 2001 and Reinhart and Rogoff (2002)). But a central bank can only work

to reduce inflation if it is supported by the public and the political process. In some countries, giving

the central bank an explicit focus on inflation targeting can help focus the public debate so that it

supports a monetary policy focus on long-run goals such as price stability (Bernanke et al., 1999).

However, these benefits require excellent communication skills on the part of the central bank in

what can be a swirling political environment in emerging market countries.



A Misaligned Exchange Rate?

        One danger of a hard exchange rate peg is the risk of being locked into a misaligned




                                                   17
exchange rate, which can be defined as a sizable difference between its actual level and the one

to which “fundamentals” would dictate. This possibility supports the case for flexible exchange

rates, but again the situation is more complex than it may at first seem.

       Even in a country with a fixed nominal exchange rate, it is possible to use taxes and

subsidies on imports and exports to alter the effective real exchange rate. For example, a uniform

tax on imports accompanied by a uniform subsidy on exports of the same size is equivalent to a

real currency depreciation – even though the nominal exchange rate stays unchanged. Moreover,

a tax-and-subsidy-induced fiscal devaluation has one built-in advantage over nominal

denomination. The fiscal devaluation has an upper bound, determined by the fact that beyond a

certain point tax evasion becomes rampant. Nominal devaluation, on the other hand, has no

upper bound and can lead to high inflation.

       But fiscal devaluation may be difficult to implement in a timely and effective manner

without well-run fiscal institutions. For example, politicians may be quick to impose a tax on

imports out of protectionist sentiment, happy to use a fiscal devaluation as an excuse, but then

slow to remove that import tax later when the reason for the devaluation has evaporated.



Expanding the Gains from Trade

       A hard exchange rate peg will tend to promote openness to trade and economic

integration (Frankel and Rose, 2002; Rose, 2000). For example, an exchange rate fixed to the

U.S. dollar will likely promote trade with the United States and other countries tied to the U.S.

dollar. Fixed exchange rates or even a common regional currency as in the European Monetary




                                                 18
Union (EMU) may help regional economic integration in the context of a common currency may be

an attractive project (this point is also discussed further below in connection with the effect of

exchange rate regimes on institutions). Thus, countries which are seeking to expand trade would

naturally place a higher value on some form of a fixed exchange rate with a trading partner..

        Along with gains from trade, an economy that is more open to trade may also be less

susceptible to sudden stops. An expansion of trade means that a greater share of businesses are

involved in the tradable sector. Because the goods they produce are traded internationally, they are

more likely to be priced in foreign currency, which means that their balance sheets are less exposed

to negative consequences from a devaluation of the currency when their debts are denominated in

foreign currency. Then, a devaluation which raises the value of their debt in terms of domestic

currency is also likely to raise the value of their assets as well, thus insulating their balance sheets

from the devaluation.6 Moreover, the more open is the economy, the smaller will be the required

real currency depreciation following a sudden stop (Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi, 2002).


Reducing the Risk Premium in Interest Rates
        Advocates of hard exchange rate pegs suggest that it can reduce the currency risk component

in domestic interest rates, thus lowering the borrowing costs for both the government and the private
sector and improving the outlook for financial deepening, investment and growth. Some, such as
Schuler (1999), have even gone so far as to suggest that dollarization will allow domestic interest
rates in emerging market countries to converge to those in the United States

        However, the risk of government default and the related risk of confiscation of private assets


6
  If traded goods are not denominated in the same foreign currency as the debt, then this insulation may be
incomplete unless the currency used for denominating debt moves very closely with the currency used for
denominating traded goods.




                                                    19
denominated in both domestic and foreign currency are more likely to be the source of high interest
rates in emerging market countries than is currency risk. The experience of Ecuador serves to
illustrate this point. The spread between Ecuador’s sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds
remained at high levels in the first half of 2000, even though the government had already

dollarized in January of the same year. Spreads came down considerably only after the
government reached an agreement with its creditors in August 2000 that resulted in a substantial
debt reduction of 40 percent. Sound fiscal policies which make government defaults extremely
unlikely are thus essential to getting interest rates to approach those in advanced countries. Indeed,
Chile, with its flexible exchange rate regime, has been able to achieve lower interest rates on its

sovereign debt than Panama, which is dollarized (Edwards, 2001).




Flexibility in Wages and Prices

       It is possible that emerging market economies, with their large informal sectors, have

greater price and wage flexibility than developed economies. An economy with highly flexible

wages and prices has less need of a flexible exchange rate.

       To some extent, the degree of flexibility in wages and prices is controlled by government

regulation. For example, public sector wages are often a component of the economy that is quite

inflexible. However, it may be politically palatable to index public sector wages to their

comparable private sector wages, and thus create greater flexibility. In general, an emerging

market economy with a greater degree of flexibility in wages and prices will benefit less from

the additional flexibility of a floating exchange rate.




                                                  20
Widespread Loans in a Foreign Currency

        Liability dollarization makes a policy of freely floating exchange rates more difficult to

sustain. When the monetary authority knows that a currency devaluation can lead to extreme

stress on the financial sector, it cannot turn a blind eye to exchange rate fluctuations (Mishkin

and Savastano, 2001). A large devaluation when there is extensive liability dollarization raises

the value of the foreign denominated debt, deals a heavy blow to balance sheets, and therefore

can lead to a full-fledged financial crisis (Mishkin, 1996).7

        The extent of liability dollarization is partly affected by government financial regulatory

policy. For example, regulations can help to ensure that financial institutions match up any foreign-

denominated liabilities with foreign-denominated assets, and thus reduce currency risk. But even

when the banks have equal foreign-denominated (dollar) assets and liabilities, if banks dollar assets

are loans to companies in dollars who themselves are unhedged, then banks' are effectively

unhedged against currency devaluations because the dollar loans become nonperforming when the

devaluation occurs; for discussion of how this problem occurred in Mexico, see Mishkin (1996) and

Garber (1999). Thus limiting currency mismatches may require additional government policies to

limit liability dollarization or at least reduce the incentives for it to occur. If a country wishes to

choose a floating exchange regime, it would be wise to implement financial regulatory policies to

discourage currency mismatches and liability dollarization.8 For example, both Chile and Argentina


7
   Furthermore, it may induce the government to provide subsidized hedging instruments, which could
substantially increase fiscal imbalance (this was the case in Brazil after the 1999 large devaluation of the
real), impairing credibility.
8
  However, the possible costs of pursuing such a policy also have to be taken into account. The literature




                                                    21
experienced a sudden stop after the 1998 Russian crisis, but the impact on the Chilean economy was

relatively small because Chile’s stronger fiscal, financial and monetary institutions has resulted in

much less liability dollarization.



International Reserves

        A hard peg exchange rate system, like a currency board, may require a substantial war

chest of international reserves. It may seem that a floating exchange rate system could avoid the

cost of these reserves, but this would be too simple.

        Many large emerging market economies like Mexico, Chile, and Brazil, which have a

floating exchange rate and have announced a domestic monetary policy aimed at targetting

inflation, also have large international reserves. Indeed, they occasionally hold international

reserves in excess of monetary base. Because of these large reserves, it could be said that such

countries “float with a large life jacket.” Why do large reserves appear to be necessary even

with floating exchange rates? One explanation is that international reserves provide collateral for

public bonds issued in connection with open market operations. Another explanation is that

even a nation with a floating exchange rate must be concerned about the possibility of a run on

its currency. Finally, policymakers in emerging market economies are very sensitive to the

exchange rate because many such economies often exhibit a high pass-through coefficient; that

is, devaluation often leads to inflation (González, 2000; Hausmann, Panizza and Stein, 2001).

        Thus, nations with a domestically oriented monetary policy and floating exchange rates


on Liability Dollarization is still in its infancy and, thus, it is hard to tell whether these costs are
significant (Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza, 2002; Jeanne, 2002).




                                                        22
also have good reasons to carry high reserves, and it does not appear that they typically have

much smaller reserves than nations with fixed exchange rates.



Lender of Last Resort

       A hard exchange rate peg is sometimes said to be at a disadvantage relative to a floating

exchange rate regime because it cannot accommodate a money-printing lender of last resort.

While this argument would seem to weaken the case for fixed exchange rates, the scope for a

lender of last resort for emerging market countries with floating rates is oversold (Calvo, 2001;

Mishkin, 1999a, 2001).

       In advanced economies, the monetary authority can issue liquidity to bail out the banking

system but this extra liquidity is expected to be soaked up by open market operations in the near

future, so that bank bailouts can stabilize the banking system with little if any inflationary

consequences. In contrast, in emerging market countries, central bank lending to the banking

system in the wake a financial crisis—characterized by a sudden stop in capital inflows—is likely to

unleash fears of an inflationary explosion and produce a sharp exchange rate depreciation. If there is

substantial liability dollarization, the depreciation will then have a major negative impact on private

sector balance sheets, which will then promote even more financial instability.

       This discussion reemphasizes an earlier lesson. If monetary institutions are well-developed

and the central bank has sufficient credibility, only then can the central bank act as a lender of last

resort. Alternatively, a government can secure contingent credit lines (like the central bank of

Argentina did during the so-called Convertibility Program), but these credit lines can be very




                                                  23
expensive and may not be sufficient when a crisis hits.



Shifts from Fixed to Floating Regimes

       Even if a country might be better served in the long run by adopting a floating exchange

rate regime, the timing of the shift from a peg can have serious economic consequences. The

costs of shifting from a fixed exchange rate regimes to a floating regime under conditions of

economic stress, like a sudden stop, are especially striking. As discussed earlier, a move from a

fixed to a floating exchange rate regime in the midst of a sudden stop is likely to exacerbate the

crisis. The initial devaluation which raises the value of foreign-denominated debt can cause

widespread destruction of corporations’ and household balance sheets, which sends the economy

into a devastating downward spiral. Recent papers by Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2002) and

Jeanne (2002) also suggest that de-dollarization (the reestablishment of a domestic currency)

may require a major overhaul of the domestic financial sector. Development of the necessary

institutions to support a successful domestically oriented monetary policy takes time.



Can Exchange Rate Regimes Improve Economic Institutions?



       The discussion in the preceding section focuses on what institutional traits or policy concerns

should cause a country to prefer fixed or floating exchange rates. But the possibility of reverse

causation also deserves consideration. Perhaps the choice of exchange rate regime should not be

analyzed as a response to existing institutional traits, but instead as a potential cause of preferred




                                                 24
institutional outcomes. Research on theories of institutional development in emerging market

countries is in its early stages, but is developing rapidly.9 But several intriguing hypotheses about

how exchange rate regimes may improve institutions have been proposed.

       Advocates of hard exchange rate pegs argue that they improve fiscal institutions and trigger

sounder budgetary management, because if the central bank is focused on a fixed exchange rate,

then the government no longer has access to the money printing press to finance its spending (for

example, Hanke and Schuler, 1994). As the recent example of Argentina suggests, where the fiscal

tensions between the provinces and the central government were not solved by the currency board,

hard pegs may be less effective at constraining fiscal policy than was previously believed. Hard

pegs may even weaken incentives for governments to put their fiscal house in order, because the

hard peg may make it easier for governments to borrow foreign funds, thus allowing them to delay

necessary reforms to fix fiscal imbalances. For example, Panama (which has been dollarized for

close to a hundred years) has had poor fiscal performance, with fiscal deficits over 7 percent in the

1970s and averaging 5 percent in the 1980s – it is just in recent years that the fiscal position has

improved to the point that the fiscal surplus averaged 1.4 percent during the 1990s. On the other

hand, it is not clear that in floating exchange rate systems, the conduct of monetary policy has any

particular impact in promoting fiscal responsibility. However, one might argue that a floating

exchange rate, particularly if it involves the government in setting an inflation target, has the

potential to promote government transparency and fiscal responsibility.

       Advocates of hard pegs (e.g. Hausmann, 1999) also suggest that dollarization promotes a

9
 For example, see La Porta, Lopes-de-Silanes, Vishny and Shleifer (1998), Shleifer and Vishny 1999)
and Boone, Breach, Friedman and Johnson (2000).




                                                  25
healthier financial system because it avoids currency mismatches and deepens the financial system,

making it less prone to crisis. However, there is little evidence to support this view (Eichengreen,

2002). On the other hand, a hard exchange rate peg in the form of a currency board might encourage

unhedged dollar (foreign-denominated) liabilities that non-financial and financial firms might be

willing to undertake, thus making the financial system more vulnerable in case the system has to be

abandoned, as illustrated by Argentina in 2002. The hard peg might also encourage the issuance of

dollar liabilities because financial firms would believe that the government would feel responsible

for any devaluation and would, thus, be more likely to offer a bail-out (McKinnon and Pill, 1999;

Broda and Levy-Yeyati, 2000). However, the evidence that floating rate regimes lead to less

liability dollarization is quite weak (Honig, 2003). After all, on its face a floating exchange rate

would seem to encourage holding some assets in several different currencies as a form of

diversification. For example, Peru, with its floating exchange rate regime has a tremendous amount

of liability dollarization, while Brazil when it had a quasi-fixed exchange regime rate in the period of

1994 to 1999 did not.

       Can the choice of exchange rate regime help improve monetary institutions that enable the

monetary authorities to build credibility? If a fixed exchange rate regime is constructed with a full

array of supporting institutions, then it would seem to offer at least a gain in credibility – although

after the collapse of Argentina’s fixed rate system, such credibility will always remain incomplete.

Moreover, a floating exchange rate can be a mechanism for monetary credibility as well, Tornell

and Velasco (2000) argue, because the foreign exchange market will anticipate the effects of

policy inconsistency by devaluing the exchange rate, providing a clear signal that something is




                                                  26
rotten. Moreover, the signal itself could help establish some discipline in government’s quarters

and possibly lead to a timely rectification of policy inconsistencies (Mishkin, 1998).

       Although at the outset, the credibility of the monetary authorities might be weak and the

public support for central bank independence may not be all that strong, adoption of inflation

targeting might help the central bank to work to produce “constrained discretion” (Bernanke and

Mishkin, 1997) in which transparent discussion of the conduct of monetary policy and

accountability of the central bank for achieving its inflation target might make it more difficult

for the central bank to follow overly expansionary monetary policy.        In addition, over time it

may help obtain credibility for the central bank as it did in Chile, and it may also increase support

for the central bank independence. Indeed, Mishkin and Posen (1997) and Bernanke et al. (1999)

suggest that the support for central bank independence in the United Kingdom was a direct result of

the inflation targeting regime. However, although inflation targeting might help with central bank

credibility and support for central bank independence to some extent, a fair degree of support for

good monetary institutions already needs to be present if inflation targeting is to have a chance of

success.

       There is some evidence that hard exchange rate pegs, particularly those in currency unions,

do encourage openness to trade and integration with the countries to which the currency is pegged

(Frankel and Rose, 2002; Rose, 2000). As we mentioned earlier, trade openness can reduce the

vulnerability of emerging markets to financial crises, while economic integration with an anchor

country reduces the cost of the loss of domestic monetary policy with a hard peg.

       The possible connections between exchange rate regimes and the improvement of economic




                                                 27
institutions is a potentially important topic for future research.



The Choice of Exchange Rate Regimes in Context



        When choosing between exchange rate regimes, one size does not fit all (or always). This

argues against international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World

Bank and other development banks having a strong bias toward one type of exchange rate regime.

Instead, an informed choice of exchange rate regime requires a deep understanding of a country’s

economy, institutions, and political culture.

        Indeed, we believe that the choice of exchange rate regime is likely to be of second order

importance to the development of good fiscal, financial, and monetary institutions in producing

macroeconomic success in emerging market countries. Rather than treating the exchange rate regime

as a primary choice, we would encourage a greater focus on institutional reforms like improved bank

and financial sector regulation, fiscal restraint, building consensus for a sustainable and predictable

monetary policy, and increasing openness to trade. A focus on institutional reforms rather than on

the exchange rate regime may encourage emerging market countries to be healthier and less prone to

the crises than we have seen in recent years.

Note: A sudden stop is defined as a reversal in capital inflows that i)
exceeds the mean minus two standard deviations of the annual change in
capital inflows observed since 1990, and ii) is associated with a decline in
output. The exercise also considers rises in the real exchange rate that i)
exceed the mean plus two standard deviations of the annual change in the
real exchange rate observed since 1990, and ii) are greater than 20 percent.
The sample consists of 15 emerging economies and 17 developed countries.
See Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejía (2003) for further details and some
sensitivity analysis.

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper argues that much of the debate on choosing an exchange rate regime misses the boat. It
begins by discussing the standard theory of choice between exchange rate regimes, and then
explores the weaknesses in this theory, especially when it is applied to emerging market economies.
It then discusses a range of institutional traits that might predispose a country to favor either fixed or
floating rates, and then turns to the converse question of whether the choice of exchange rate regime
may favor the development of certain desirable institutional traits. The conclusion from the analysis
is that the choice of exchange rate regime is likely to be of second order importance to the
development of good fiscal, financial, and monetary institutions in producing macroeconomic
success in emerging market countries. This suggests that less attention should be focused on the
general question whether a floating or a fixed exchange rate is preferable, and more on these deeper
institutional arrangements. A focus on institutional reforms rather than on the exchange rate regime
may encourage emerging market countries to be healthier and less prone to the crises that we have
seen in recent years.
