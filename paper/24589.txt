Deposit Inflows and Outflows in Failing Banks: The Role of Deposit Insurance

                                          ABSTRACT

Using unique, daily, account-level balances data we investigate deposit stability and the drivers of
deposit outflows and inflows in a distressed bank. We observe an outflow of uninsured depositors
from the bank following bad regulatory news. We find that government deposit guarantees, both
regular deposit insurance and temporary deposit insurance measures, reduce the outflow of
deposits. We also characterize which accounts are more stable (e.g., checking accounts and older
accounts). We further provide important new evidence that, simultaneous with the run-off, gross
funding inflows are large and of first-order impact — a result which is missed when looking at
aggregated deposit data alone. Losses of uninsured deposits were largely offset with new insured
deposits as the bank approached failure. We show our results hold more generally using a large
sample of banks that faced regulatory action. Our results raise questions about depositor
discipline, widely considered to be one of the key pillars of financial stability, raising the
importance of other mechanisms of restricting bank risk taking, including prudent supervision.

1         Introduction
There were many bank failures during and after the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In this
period, many systemically important institutions, as well as numerous smaller firms, faced
severe liquidity stress. The inability of financial institutions to maintain stable funding
sources was central to the crisis, which resulted in the high-profile failure or near failure of
many financial institutions and unprecedented emergency liquidity support by governments
around the world. Large quantities of deposits exited from failing banks, prompting a host
of academic studies and regulatory responses attempting to find ways to reduce illiquidity
and funding stress.
    Many governments extended the scope and limit of deposit insurance in an effort to reduce
deposit outflows during the crisis; in the US, deposit insurance was increased from $100,000
to $250,000, and other countries, such as the UK, took similar measures. At the same time,
governments introduced temporary deposit insurance measures, such as the Transaction Ac-
count Guarantee (TAG) Program, which removed the cap for deposit insurance coverage
for many deposit accounts in the US during the crisis. New post-crisis liquidity regulation
advocated by Basel requires that banks maintain adequate “stability-adjusted” funding con-
sistent with their “liquidity-adjusted” assets. For such liquidity regulations to be effective,
they must accurately characterize the stability of various funding sources. Despite the im-
portance of these measures, there is little academic empirical evidence on whether deposit
insurance matters; what deposits are stable; or whether we need to look beyond the focus on
deposit outflows to inflows and how this might affect our thinking on liquidity requirements.
    In this paper we make a first attempt at answering the following questions: How effective
was deposit insurance — both regular deposit insurance as well as temporary measures
such as TAG — in preventing the outflow of deposits? What kind of depositors withdraw?
How stable are different kinds of deposits? Do depositors discipline banks and, if so, is it
effective? While the focus of attention by academicians and regulators alike has been on
deposit outflows, what about deposit inflows — are they material? How appropriate are key
assumptions of the new liquidity regulations such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)?
    We use a unique, highly granular dataset to assess the impacts of these liquidity-related
policy interventions on funding stability, with a particular focus on deposit insurance; in the
process, we also uncover a number of other interesting results on the drivers of deposit(or)
stability. The data we use were collected by the FDIC from a US bank1 shortly after
    1
        Throughout, unless otherwise noted, we use the term “bank” to refer to any insured depository insti-

                                                       2
its failure, and they allow us to measure daily, account-level balances and attributes for
several years. Importantly, unlike with aggregated data such as Call Reports, we are able
to separately assess inflows and outflows — a distinction that turns out to be of first-order
importance. We then generalize our results by studying a large panel of US banks that faced
regulatory action.
    It is especially illuminating to consider gross2 funding outflows and inflows separately.
Essentially all prior research, lacking such a detailed dataset, can focus only on net flows;
our finding of depositor run-in demonstrates that focusing on net flows is insufficient. Our
separate consideration of gross outflows and inflows gives rise to our first two sets of results.
    We first examine outflows in our daily-frequency data using Cox hazard models (in ad-
dition to probits and linear probability models). We find that FDIC insurance and other
government guarantees, including temporary measures such as TAG, significantly reduce the
withdrawals of insured depositors in response to ailing bank health. Our results thus support
the notion that deposit insurance — even temporary measures which one might worry are not
well-understood by depositors — does indeed improve funding stability. We additionally find
connections between account characteristics and deposit stability, in that checking accounts
are more stable than savings accounts, and depositors receiving regular direct deposits such
as payroll are less likely to leave the bank. We also find that depositors who have been with
the bank longer are less likely to exit, even when faced with bad regulatory news. Next,
our evidence supports the finding that term deposits, which explicitly have withdrawal re-
strictions, were more risk sensitive and less “sticky” than (demandable) transaction deposits.
This is at odds with many economists’ intuition, but likely reflects the relative sophistication
of term depositors and the inherently forward-looking nature of a non-demandable deposit.
Finally, we show that when uninsured depositors leave the bank under stress, they typically
withdraw a large share even of insured funds. This result is especially relevant for financial
stability, as even a substantial share of banks’ insured funding may flee in response to bad
news.
    Next, we study deposit inflows. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show
tution, whether it be a commercial bank, thrift, or credit union. We use the term “financial institution”
when needed, which includes the term “bank,” as well as institutions such as non-bank finance companies,
insurance companies, hedge funds and other entities often referred to as “shadow banks.”
   2
     We use the term “gross” somewhat loosely here. When we refer to gross outflows, we are actually
referring to the net change in funding from existing depositors. Gross inflows refer to net changes in funding
from new depositors. Especially in periods of stress, existing depositors almost exclusively flee the bank (i.e.,
they generate few gross inflows) and new depositors continue arriving (generating few gross outflows), such
that our use of the term “gross” functionally coincides with its traditional definition.



                                                       3
that in the presence of government guarantees, gross funding inflows are of first-order impact
— even in imminently failing banks. The failed bank we study was able to replace about
a third of its deposit base in the last year of its life, while it was publicly known to be
under supervisory scrutiny for its declining condition. About half of these new deposits
arrived in the last ninety days before failure, after public regulatory reports showed the
bank to be critically undercapitalized. The bank attracted these deposits almost exclusively
from small financial institutions around the US, most with no previous relationship, using
internet deposit listing services.3 The new deposits were almost all term deposits paying
above-market interest rates and structured to fall just under the FDIC insurance limit.
    We then use a mix of public data and confidential supervisory data to show that our
findings generalize to other US banks. We identify over 2,000 other banks that were subject
to regulatory actions similar to the one faced by this studied bank. We find that banks
facing such actions substitute funding away from brokered deposits and time deposits over
$250,000, but increase their reliance on listing service deposits and time deposits below
$250,000. Banks especially increase reliance on term deposits with balances above $100,000
but below $250,000, the range in which term deposits structured to fall just under the
insurance limit would be. These results suggest our findings from the detailed micro data
generalize to US banks facing enforcement actions.
    Abstracting from the specifics of our bank, the run-in phenomenon we document has
implications for the moral hazard arising from deposit insurance. On one hand, the run-in
we document may be a beneficial phenomenon reflecting the fact that deposit insurance
improves funding stability, allowing illiquid but solvent institutions to maintain sufficient
private funding to avoid failure. On the other hand, our finding may reflect moral hazard
arising from deposit insurance, allowing banks to choose socially inefficiently high levels of
risk (while transferring much of this risk to the government). Because the run-in allows banks
to shift credit risk from depositors to the government as they approach failure, depositors
will not, in aggregate, demand appropriate risk premia. This in turn may incentivize the
bank to make inefficiently risky loans. This run-in is a previously undocumented mechanism
   3
    Listing services are firms which provide potential depositors with a list of deposit rates (one for each
participating bank) for a number of standard deposit products, often sorted from the highest rate to the
lowest and displayed on a website. For supervisory purposes, being classified as a listing service need not
imply that one is a third-party deposit placement service, though some deposits may fall in both categories.
For the sake of clarity we therefore use the terms “placed deposit” and “listing service deposit” as mutually
exclusive terms, unless otherwise noted; if a deposit could be considered both, we code it as a placed deposit.
For more detail on the supervisory definition and treatment of listed, placed, and brokered deposits, see
FDIC’s “Frequently Asked Questions on Identifying, Accepting and Reporting Brokered Deposits.”



                                                      4
by which deposit insurance weakens depositor discipline. Our results therefore emphasize the
importance of supervisory discipline for financial stability.4 Our findings on inflows also show
the importance of assessing net and gross flows of funds to evaluate new liquidity regulations.
Several prominent scholars have recently highlighted the dearth of academic research on new
liquidity rules, in spite of liquidity concerns in the last financial crisis (Diamond and Kashyap
(2016), Allen and Gale (2017)). We use our unique deposit-level data to assess these rules
by considering net as well as gross outflows, the latter of which requires account-level data.
We also directly compare our observed deposit run-off to the rates assumed in liquidity
regulations. We find that, while the bank experienced lower rates of run-off than LCR would
forecast, NSFR run-off rates (as currently drafted) are lower than what the bank experienced,
especially during periods of extreme stress.
    Our paper contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. Much of the
empirical literature on bank runs employs aggregate data. This literature in general finds that
banks with worse fundamentals experience greater deposit withdrawals in a crisis (Gorton
(1988); Saunders and Wilson (1996); Calomiris and Mason (1997)), and that large amounts of
uninsured deposits can lead to unstable banks (Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017)). A small
set of papers examines responses of individual deposit(or)s to bank runs. These papers either
use snapshots of data (Davenport and McDill (2006)) or data from banks in other countries,
such as India (Iyer and Puri (2012); Iyer, Puri, and Ryan (2016)); Denmark (Iyer, Jensen,
Johannesen, and Sheridan (2016)); and Switzerland (Brown, Guin, and Morkoetter (2014)).
The theoretical model of Egan et al. (2017) provides a framework in which to understand our
results. For example, their model predicts that uninsured depositors flee distressed banks,
distressed banks pay higher rates to attract depositors, and insured depositors respond little
or even flow into distressed banks — all of which we document empirically. Whether or not
the inflows we find are socially beneficial is related to the causes of bank funding instability,
the rationale for deposit insurance, and the literature on panic- versus fundamentals-driven
bank runs (Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Jacklin and Bhattacharya (1988), Gorton (1988),
Saunders and Wilson (1996), Calomiris and Mason (1997)). To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first paper to use continuous, daily, account-level depositor data for a failed
bank in the US to systematically show the importance of deposit inflows in a failing bank
occurring simultaneously with large deposit outflows. Our data covers a period in time when
temporary deposit insurance measures such as TAG came into effect. As such, we are able
   4
     Lacking reliable data on the asset side of our bank, we cannot assess the extent to which the run-in
affected this particular banks lending behavior; the lending behavior of failing banks is left to future studies.



                                                       5
to add to the literature by examining the effectiveness of both regular deposit insurance
measures as well as temporary deposit insurance measures on which regulators worldwide
have put much faith. We are also able to provide evidence on the stability of accounts based
on their deposit product type, length of depositor relationship, and ownership structure.
Additionally we throw light on new, post-crisis rules such as LCR and NSFR. Finally, we
provide important new evidence of substantial deposit inflows in times of stress, raising
significant questions about the effectiveness of depositor discipline on bank behavior. We
are able to generalize the results on deposit inflows across a large sample of US banks that
were subject to regulatory action. This is an important new result that has implications for
future work on deposit stability by both academicians and regulators.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief history of
the bank to highlight our key findings and provide context for later analysis. Then, Section
3 presents regression results on the drivers of deposit liquidation; Section 4 presents results
on inflows of new depositors; and Section 5 generalizes our qualitative findings to all US
banks. Section 6 documents our assessment of the LCR and NSFR rules in relation to the
bank. Section 7 concludes.


2       Data Description and Background
We construct our dataset from data collected by the FDIC shortly after the bank’s failure,
building daily account balances for each deposit account. We associate accounts with their
primary owner and his or her relevant characteristics. We are able to reliably construct
account-level daily deposit balances from early 2006 until the bank’s failure. We observe all
account transactions over this period, including a granular description of the transaction and
the dollar amount. We checked our constructed account balances against Call Reports on
total deposits and deposits by account category, and deposits by branch against the FDIC
Summary of Deposits data.5 General summary statistics about these bank accounts are
shown in Table 1.
    Until mid-2007, this bank appeared relatively healthy. The bank had approximately $2
billion in assets and primarily made residential real estate loans at this point in its life,
but it also offered wealth management services. While the bank employed Federal Home
Loan Bank advances (FHLBs) as funding sources, we find no evidence that it took discount
    5
    We also, for example, checked individual accounts to ensure that accounts had zero balance before
account opening and after closing, which ensures no transactions were missed.



                                                 6
window loans or Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds. The bank sourced deposits
from physical branches as well as internet depositors with a particular focus on savings
accounts. The balances in accounts with some uninsured balances, both transaction and
term deposits6 , were steadily rising (see Figure 1).
    By mid-2007, there were signs of the growing financial-system-wide stress at this bank.
Between this time and August 2008, there was net run-off in uninsured balances. Figure
1 shows that this was particularly rapid among uninsured term deposits. While less than
40% of uninsured transaction balances ran off during the period, over 50% of uninsured term
deposit balances did so; this is the first indication of our finding that term depositors are more
risk sensitive. There was comparatively little change in insured deposits. While this period
excludes the worst of the financial crisis, stress was building in the financial sector — Bear
Stearns and IndyMac failed, Northern Rock experienced a run, and some investment funds
had frozen withdrawals. Thus, it is not surprising that depositors, particularly sophisticated
depositors, began to react. During this time period, the bank significantly curtailed its
residential lending activities. Thereafter and up until failure, the bank continued to make
commercial and personal loans, along with a small number of residential mortgage products.
    Fall of 2008 saw severe credit and liquidity risks realized across the financial system as
well as significant changes in financial policy. The most important policy change for our
purpose was the increase in the FDIC’s deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000
effective October 3, 2008.7 Additionally, the FDIC’s TAG program became effective on
October 14, 2008, temporarily providing unlimited deposit insurance for negotiable order
of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, non-interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, and interest
on lawyer trust accounts (IOLTAs), which cover all categories of checking accounts at this
bank. The change in deposit insurance is evident in Figure 1, where uninsured deposits
drop and insured deposits jump between the Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis periods denoted
with grey bars. Much of the sudden change in balances by insurance status is mechanical,
as deposit accounts between $100,000 and $250,000 suddenly became insured. Much of the
remaining change among transaction accounts reflects the almost simultaneous application
of TAG guarantees. In contrast, changes in term deposit balances are partly driven by the
   6
     Throughout this paper, we use the phrase “transaction account” to refer to all non-maturity accounts,
namely, both checking and savings accounts. We acknowledge that the phrase “transaction account” has a
more precise meaning in certain contexts, such as in the Federal Reserve’s Regulation D. Additionally, we
use “term deposit” and “certificate of deposit” (“CD”) as synonyms. We classify accounts as insured or
uninsured using an approximation of the deposit insurance process, aggregating deposit accounts based on
their owners and ownership categories before applying the deposit insurance limit for each category.
   7
     Initially, this increase was through the end of 2010, but it was made permanent by the Dodd Frank Act.



                                                    7
bank’s rapid acquisition of placed deposits, as shown in Figure 2 and discussed at greater
length below. Further supporting the notion that term depositors at the bank are more
sophisticated and risk-sensitive, uninsured term balances never increase substantially after
October 2008.
    The inflow of uninsured transaction deposits suggests that the time immediately after
the financial crisis was one of limited stress at this bank. The acute system-wide stress of the
crisis had receded and the bank’s health had not yet significantly deteriorated.8 Then, about
a year before the bank’s failure, its primary federal regulator took its first publicly announced
action to address the declining health of the bank through a Cease and Desist (C&D) order.9
The C&D order cited a variety of issues at the bank including insufficient capital and poor
board and management oversight, and it was made public immediately, appearing in the
local press within a couple of business days. It was described by a banking analyst quoted
in the local press as unusually harsh and indicative of high supervisory concern about the
bank. Reports in the local press also remarked on the bank’s poor health as revealed by its
financial ratios in a recent public regulatory report.10 As can be seen in Figure 1, there is
an increase in aggregate run-off for transaction accounts — both insured and uninsured —
unsurprisingly given the negative attention on the bank. As noted above, there were few
uninsured term deposits left at the bank, although the few that remained still responded to
the news.
    Finally, three to four months before the bank failed, the banks’ public regulatory filings
(including amendments to previous filings) began showing the bank to be “significantly
undercapitalized” and, within weeks, to be “critically undercapitalized.” The term “critically
undercapitalized” is defined by law as the lowest of five ranges for bank capitalization ratios.
Banks are considered critically undercapitalized if their leverage ratio falls below 2%; nearly
insolvent in book value terms. Importantly, Prompt Correction Action (PCA) guidelines
generally require federal regulators to place a bank into receivership or conservatorship (i.e.,
fail the bank) within 90 days of it becoming critically undercapitalized.11 Depositors would
   8
      Acharya and Mora (2015) document a similar inflow of deposits into the banking system after government
actions in late 2008, suggesting the actions reaffirmed markets’ confidence in the financial safety net and
thus the safety of the financial system (see also Pennacchi (2006), Gatev and Strahan (2006)).
    9
      The bank had previously been subject to a non-public memorandum of understanding (MOU) as well as
a later troubled condition letter (TCL). These were intended to address many of the same problems which led
to the bank’s demise. Such confidential, informal enforcement actions are a common element of regulators’
response to ailing bank health in earlier stages, when failure is relatively unlikely.
   10
      We are unable to confirm the exact date of the regulatory report’s release due to changes in the regulatory
landscape following the financial crisis.
   11
      See 12 U.S.C. §1831o for more detail.



                                                       8
expect the bank to fail soon, and uninsured deposit run-off accelerated substantially, as
shown in the far right of the top panel of Figure 1.
    Ultimately, the bank failed, and its primary federal regulator concluded that its failure
was a result of heavy credit losses on the loan portfolio, especially adjustable rate mortgages.
The resolution of the bank cost the FDIC approximately 10% of the bank’s assets. For
context, of the 54 banks with assets between $1 and $10 billion which failed12 between 2007-
2014, the average cost was 18% of bank assets with a right skew, placing this bank’s losses
in the middle third of the loss rate distribution.


2.1       Defining Time Periods of Special Relevance
For the purpose of our empirical analysis, we separately analyze depositor behavior in each
of four windows of time available to us, described below. We identified these time periods
using the bank’s data and macroeconomic events in order to conduct our tests. In reverse
chronological order, the time periods are:

       Formal Enforcement Action. This is a period of significant bank-specific distress and
        represents the primary time period of interest. This period begins with the C&D
        order (a formal enforcement action) and ends with the failure of the bank. Unlike
        earlier periods, the stress arose from bank-specific adverse information, rather than
        from system-wide anxiety. This is generally abbreviated as the Formal period.

       Post-Crisis. The Post-Crisis period begins in December 2008, shortly after the gov-
        ernment’s emergency actions in fall 2008, and runs until the end of May 2009. The
        Post-Crisis period was a period of considerable distress across the financial system. Un-
        like in the Formal period, though, there were not significant revelations of bank-specific
        trouble. As such, the Post-Crisis period allows us to compare depositor behavior in
        response to market-wide stress. We exclude a few months in the fall of 2008 to avoid
        the confounding effects of emergency actions by the US government, as well as markets’
        expectations related to those actions.

       Pre-Crisis. The next time period we focus on is the year-long period before the financial
        crisis ending just before September 2008. As discussed above, uninsured deposits began
        running off during this period, particularly uninsured term deposits.
 12
      We exclude open bank assistance (OBA) from our definition of failure in computing this statistic.




                                                      9
     Placebo. We utilize a period of time in 2006 as a placebo period, establishing baseline
      depositor behavior when neither the bank nor the financial system were perceived to
      be especially troubled.


3     Analysis of Deposit Run-Off
This section presents an analysis using several regression models. We regress a dummy indi-
cating whether the account liquidates on a variety of account and depositor characteristics
in the context of Cox proportional hazard, linear probability (LPM), and probit models.
Because the liquidation behavior of term deposits is quite different from that of transaction
deposits, we run regressions separately on the two categories. For both term and transac-
tion deposits, we run separate regressions for each of the four time periods described above:
Placebo, Pre-Crisis, Post-Crisis, and Formal Enforcement Action.
    All variables used in the regressions are defined in Table 2, with one other consideration
related to TAG and Dodd Frank Act (DFA) deposit guarantees. In regressions estimated
on the Placebo and Pre-Crisis periods, we replace the Covered by TAG/DFA dummy with a
dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the account is a checking account and over the FDIC
limit as of the start of the regression period. In those regressions, the replacement dummy
variable is used to establish baseline behavior for large checking accounts, which is the same
set of accounts covered by TAG subsequent to the crisis. Then, in the Formal period, we
replace the Covered by TAG/DFA dummy with a Covered by DFA dummy. TAG ends and
DFA guarantees begin midway through the Formal period, with the ultimate effect that NOW
accounts are no longer covered by unlimited insurance. Given that TAG’s expiration was
known in advance, we may expect depositors in large NOW accounts to liquidate balances
prior to the scheduled end of their deposit guarantees. This would generate a positive
relationship between NOW status and liquidation at the same time that non-interest checking
and IOLTA accounts (both still covered by DFA) may show a negative relationship. Thus,
we only mark accounts covered by the DFA guarantees (but not TAG) with 1 for this dummy
in the Formal period.
    In the discussion of the results, we generally compare the Cox model results across differ-
ent time periods. The Cox results are expressed as hazard ratios from a panel of accounts,
meaning that they can be directly compared in spite of the fact that the time periods of the
regressions are of different length; this is not true of the LPM and probit results, as they are
run as cross sections and simply consider the probability of ever liquidating during the time

period. We include dummies for the branch with which the bank associated each account,
though we do not report their coefficients. Regressions here explain the rate of account liq-
uidation13 as a function of deposit(or) characteristics; for a quantitative discussion of run-off
rates, see Section 6 and its analysis of liquidity regulation.


3.1     Drivers of Transaction Deposit Run-Off
Focusing first on transaction deposits, Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the regression estimates
for each of the four time periods.
     The Placebo period in 2006 (Table 3) establishes a baseline for “normal” depositor be-
havior with little financial stress. First, we find that the Uninsured dummy is statistically
significant and positive, implying uninsured accounts liquidate at a rate about 14% faster
than the baseline hazard, meaning insured deposits are more stable than uninsured deposits.
Second, the interaction of the Uninsured dummy with the Checking dummy is not statis-
tically different from zero, showing that uninsured checking accounts liquidate at the same
rate as other uninsured accounts in normal times. This is a useful finding as it serves as a
baseline against which to assess the impacts of TAG; during and after the crisis, this set of
accounts was covered by the temporary, unlimited FDIC insurance provided by TAG. Next,
the coefficient on checking is negative and significant, with depositors liquidating checking
accounts at only a little more than half the baseline hazard rate, making checking accounts
a relatively stable funding source. Fourth, we also show that accounts which are receiving
direct deposits roughly every two weeks (indicative of direct-deposited paychecks or other
regular transactions) are also less likely to liquidate, doing so at 65% of the baseline rate, as
indicated by the negative and significant Direct Deposit dummy. Finally, the Trust dummy
is insignificant, meaning that accounts held by trusts liquidate at about the same rate as the
baseline hazard.
     We also control for other account and depositor characteristics. Because there is relatively
little variation across time periods in our coefficient estimates for these additional controls,
we will discuss them mainly with respect to the Placebo period. For instance, depositors with
a longer relationship with the bank are generally more stable as shown by the negative and
significant coefficient on Log(Age), though the coefficients are only significant in the Placebo
and Formal periods. The rate at which depositors conduct transactions has a significant,
  13
    As stated in Table 2, liquidation refers to withdrawing more than 50% of deposits as of the start of the
period and then remaining that low for 61 days or longer. Results are robust to other thresholds of 75%,
90%, and 95%.



                                                    11
non-linear relationship with liquidation behavior, as both Prior Transactions coefficients are
significant but with opposite signs. Accounts with very infrequent transactions (unaware or
inactive depositors) and accounts with very frequent transactions (operationally important
accounts, from the depositors’ perspective) are less likely to liquidate than the baseline
hazard. Accounts in the middle, with moderate usage, are more likely to liquidate than the
baseline. While there are statistically significant differences in this basic result across time
periods, the differences are economically insignificant. Finally, transaction accounts marked
by the Institutional dummy are not significantly more or less likely to liquidate than the
baseline account in all periods.
    Moving to the Pre-Crisis period in Table 4, we see that little changes. The coefficient
estimates for the Uninsured dummy are similar to their estimates from the Placebo period,
though they are less consistently significant. The interaction of Checking and Uninsured
remains statistically insignificant, and checking accounts and accounts receiving regular di-
rect deposits remain roughly as stable (relative to the baseline hazard rate) compared to
the Placebo period. The coefficient on trust accounts remains insignificant. Importantly,
column 4 of Table 4 shows only the Prior Transactions coefficients are statistically different
from their Placebo period counterparts, although the sign and statistical significance remain
unchanged. The finding of similarities between the Placebo and Pre-Crisis periods is gener-
ally consistent with the historical discussion above, where transaction deposits did not much
react to building financial weaknesses before the peak of the crisis.
    Table 5 presents results for the Post-Crisis period. The Uninsured dummy is not statis-
tically different from its earlier value (see column 4), but the point estimate is much larger:
such accounts liquidate at a 44% higher rate than other accounts at the time. Similarly, the
Covered by TAG/DFA dummy, formerly the interaction of Checking and Uninsured dummies
before the advent of TAG, shows that such accounts liquidate less often. Although only the
LPM coefficient estimate is statistically different from zero, the Cox model estimates TAG-
covered accounts liquidate at a 30% lower rate than the baseline hazard, and column 4 shows
this estimate to be statistically different from the Placebo period. Table 5 also shows that
checking accounts remain more stable than non-checking transaction accounts (i.e., savings
accounts), liquidating about 30% less often, but the coefficient on the Checking dummy is
statistically smaller than in the Placebo period. Accounts receiving bi-weekly direct deposits
were previously less likely to liquidate than other accounts, and the impact is even stronger
in the Post-Crisis period than the Placebo, as shown by the statistically significantly larger
magnitude of the coefficient on Direct Deposit. The impact of prior transactions is statisti-


                                              12
cally (but not economically) significantly different from the Placebo period. Unlike in prior
periods, the Trust dummy is significantly negative — trust accounts are stickier than other
accounts in the period, running off about 26% slower.
    Finally, Table 6 presents results for the Formal period. The impact of FDIC insurance
is statistically stronger than in the Placebo period: uninsured accounts now liquidate at a
rate 92% faster than other accounts according to the Uninsured dummy. Accounts covered
by DFA guarantees liquidate about 15% slower than other accounts. However, the estimates
are not significant across all specifications, and the difference relative to the Placebo period
coefficient on Checking × Uninsured is not statistically significant. Table 6 also shows that
checking accounts; accounts receiving direct deposits every other week; and accounts held by
depositors with longer relationships with the bank continue to be statistically significantly
stickier than other accounts. While checking accounts remain less likely to liquidate than
other accounts in the Formal period (doing so about 20% slower), the impact is statistically
smaller than the corresponding estimate in the Placebo period; checking accounts remain
sticky following bank-specific bad news, but less so than in response to market-wide stress.
In contrast, the impact of the length of depositor relationships is stronger in the Formal
period than in the Placebo period; such accounts are more sticky according to the negative
Log(Age) dummy. There is no such change for the Direct Deposit dummy. Trust accounts
reverse their behavior from the Post-Crisis period and run off 17% faster than the baseline
rate as shown by the Trust dummy.
    These results have several important implications. First, we provide clear evidence that
funds covered by deposit insurance are more stable, particularly in periods of stress. More
generally, the large impacts in periods of stress demonstrate that depositors were aware of
the bank’s declining health and the limit of deposit insurance. For outflows, absent the gross
run-in we analyze in the next section, this would suggest active depositor discipline. Second,
in the Post-Crisis period, when TAG was in effect, the point estimates for Uninsured and
Covered by TAG/DFA are statistically indistinguishable. The point estimates in the first
two rows of Table 5 are similar in size, and a t-test of differences in the magnitudes of
the coefficients between TAG and regular deposit insurance fails to reject the null of no
difference with a p-value of 0.94, indicating that the magnitude of the effect of TAG is the
same as that of regular deposit insurance. Given that TAG was new and unconventional, the
program and its operational details would have been unfamiliar to depositors; the magnitude
of the impact we estimate bodes well for the effectiveness of such programs. By contrast, the
impact of DFA guarantees in the Formal period is weaker. That said, there are relatively


                                              13
few accounts covered by DFA guarantees which were over the regular FDIC limit, so the
coefficients are estimated with less precision than in earlier periods. Third, our finding
that checking accounts and accounts receiving regular direct deposits are relatively stable
in all environments supports assumptions made in rules such as the LCR and NSFR: to
be considered the most stable form of funding for LCR purposes, deposit accounts must
be fully insured retail deposits and either 1) a checking account or 2) held by a depositor
with other relationships with the bank (such as loans, other accounts, bill payment services,
etc.; Basel Committee (2013)).14 Finally, our finding on trust accounts suggests that such
depositors are more sophisticated. Trusts are useful primarily to help wealthy individuals to
protect their wealth, such that the average trust depositor is likely both wealthier and more
financially savvy than the average depositor. Trust depositors should thus be more able to
determine the solvency of the bank, a fact which could generate the observed behavior: they
are less likely than others to flee in periods of general distress (Post-Crisis) when the bank
itself is not near failure, but more likely to do so as the bank approaches failure in the Formal
period.


3.2     Drivers of Term Deposit Run-Off
Next, we conduct a parallel analysis of run-off in term deposits. Table 7 presents results
for the Placebo period regressions. First, the Uninsured dummy is statistically insignificant,
meaning that uninsured term deposits do not liquidate more than insured accounts, probably
because bank solvency was not a concern. Next, as we saw for transaction deposits, the
effect of depositor relationship age as indicated by the Log(Age) dummy is negative and,
in some specifications, significant.15 Likely due to relationship depth, such accounts are
more stable. Third, the further a term deposit is from its maturity date, the less likely it
is to liquidate. Mechanically, this reflects the fact that few term deposits withdraw before
maturity, especially in the Placebo period. Fourth, placed deposits (often thought of as “hot
money,” deposits without attachment to the bank and seeking high rates) liquidate three
times as fast as other accounts as shown by the Placed dummy, and the impact is statistically
significant. There are few institutional deposits at the bank in the Placebo period, but they
appear to liquidate slightly more often than the baseline. Finally, trust deposits, as indicated
by the Trust dummy, are less likely to liquidate than other accounts.
  14
     Note that our definition of “checking account” is synonymous with the definition of “transaction account”
in Federal Reserve Regulation D.
  15
     Note that we treat the age of placed deposits differently, as discussed in Table 2.



                                                     14
    Table 8 shows comparable results for the Pre-Crisis period. The Uninsured dummy is
now statistically different from zero and its Placebo period value. Uninsured term deposits
run-off at a rate about 17% faster than insured deposits, consistent with our finding from
Section 2 that uninsured term deposits began running off during this period. Similarly,
supportive of our finding from Section 2 that term deposits began running off sooner than
transaction deposits, the impact of insurance in this period is larger than the corresponding
estimate for transaction deposits. The stabilizing impact of depositor relationship age is
stronger relative to the Placebo period (as seen in the Log(Age) coefficient) and the impact
of time to maturity is attenuated (as shown by the Log(Days to Maturity) coefficient), though
both are statistically significant; the latter likely reflects the fact that there are more early
liquidations than in the Placebo period. The table also shows that placed deposits continue
to liquidate three times as fast as other accounts. Finally, trust accounts are no longer more
stable than other term deposit accounts, with the Trust dummy becoming insignificant.
    Table 9 shows responses in the Post-Crisis period. Point estimates for the impact of FDIC
insurance are substantially higher than in earlier periods — uninsured accounts liquidate 64%
faster than other accounts — and statistically different from the Placebo period. The results
also show that placed deposits, which we expect would be particularly risk-sensitive, run off
very rapidly, with the coefficient on the Placed dummy showing liquidations at 5.6 times the
rate of the baseline runoff. The negative coefficients on the length of depositor relationship
and time to maturity continue to indicate that longer relationships or times to maturity are
stabilizing features. Institutional and trust accounts are not statistically significant, though
their coefficient point estimates differ statistically from their Placebo period values.
    Finally, Table 10 shows estimates for the Formal period. The FDIC insurance dummy
remains large, significantly different from zero, statistically larger than in the Placebo pe-
riod, and close to the point estimate from the Post-Crisis period; uninsured term deposits
now run off 66% faster. The effect of the Log(Age) variable remains negative, but the effect
is attenuated, and it is significant only in some specifications. Term deposits further from
maturity are still less likely to liquidate, as seen in the negative Log(Days to Maturity) coeffi-
cient. Like trust transaction accounts in the Formal period, the Trust dummy demonstrates
trust term accounts are more likely to liquidate. Finally, the results show a large response
from wholesale accounts. Institutional deposits, both faxed/listed and, to a lesser extent,
other institutional deposits, are more likely to liquidate given the two positive and significant
Institutional dummies. However, many such deposits entered after the start of the Formal
period, such that they are not included in these regressions. The Placed deposits dummy,


                                               15
on the other hand, attests that such deposits run off at a rate 14 times faster than other
term deposit accounts, an high response relative to other periods and deposits, showing the
high risk sensitivity of these wholesale deposits.
    These results provide several significant insights. First and most obviously, the results
for term deposits again confirm the stabilizing impact of deposit insurance. Second, taking
the magnitude of the impact of insurance in each period as a reflection of term depositors’
bank solvency concerns, our results also confirm that term deposits were more risk sensitive
and ran off earlier than transaction deposits (a finding suggested by the discussion of Section
2 and figures referenced therein). Additionally, we show that placed deposits exhibit a high
churn rate in all periods, but they respond even stronger under stress; this supports the view
that placed deposits are hot money. As in the transaction deposit regressions, we find that
longer depositor relationships help stabilize bank funding, and the strong response of trust
depositors in the Formal period points to depositor sophistication.
    Our finding that uninsured term deposits ran off earlier than transaction deposits may, at
first, be surprising. While banking practitioners generally understand this point, economist
intuition here is motivated by theoretical models of bank runs, which emphasize the role of
deposit demandability. We suggest two reasons why term deposits are relatively unstable,
in spite of their lack of demandability. First, term depositors at this bank, particularly
uninsured term depositors, tend to be more sophisticated. A greater share of term depositors
than transaction depositors are corporate entities (especially depository institutions), and
these corporate entities may manage their assets more carefully. Second, the decision to
open or renew a term deposit is inherently more forward-looking than decisions regarding
transaction accounts because of term deposits’ early withdrawal fees, and depositors may
thus be more risk sensitive.16
  16
     This rationale may be behavioral; although the bank had a schedule of early termination fees, term
depositors generally did not pay an early withdrawal fee beyond forfeiting interest earned, and sometimes
less than that. Over our sample period, a few dozen early term deposit breakages resulted in penalties which
exceeded earned interest by as much as 2% of the principal balance (usually 1% or less), but most of these
penalties were reversed by the bank and credited back to the depositor. Thus, it would appear there were
low monetary costs to early term deposit withdrawal. However, we do not know if all customers would have
received such favorable terms if they withdrew early, and those able to acquire favorable terms are thus
incentivized to withdraw early. The very low breakage rate supports the assertion term depositors behaved
as though they were making the deposits for the entire term.

3.3     Account Liquidation and the Withdrawal of Insured Funds
Having established the increased propensity of uninsured depositors to draw down their de-
posits, we now investigate whether such depositors tend to draw down either to the insurance
limit or well below it.
   Table 11 presents our results for withdrawals from transaction accounts.17 Each row
represents one of our four periods, and for each period we consider the set of accounts with
balances above $2,000 under insurance limit at the start of the period. The columns then
show balances of these accounts at the end of the period, in six account-balance bins. Relative
to the Placebo and Pre-Crisis period, depositors in the latter two periods, especially the
Formal period, tend to draw down well below the limit: the largest groupings in the Formal
period, relative to previous periods, are accounts with $1 or less and those between $2000
and $2000 under half the insurance limit ($2000 to $123000, in this period)18 , with far fewer
accounts remaining above the deposit insurance limit than in other periods. Under stress,
uninsured depositors tend to withdraw much more than required to achieve full insurance
coverage, either drawing down to less than half of the insurance limit or liquidating all funds.
   This finding has significant implications for financial stability, since even some insured
funds are likely to flee banks in response to stress, and can serve to inform banking theory
models (such as Davila and Goldstein (2016)).19


4      Analysis of Deposit Run-In
The previous section focused on depositor run-off, which is traditionally the area of atten-
tion with respect to bank funding stability. In this section, we demonstrate that run-in is
also important to funding stability, even in a bank publicly known to be at high risk of
failure. After providing an overview of the run-in dynamics at the bank, we use a regression
framework to establish the characteristics of new depositors; present time series evidence
that this run-in was not solely driven by factors external to the bank; and provide evidence
that the run-in was instead attracted by the combination of credible deposit insurance and
  17
     We do not show a comparable table for term deposits because their behavior is simpler: generally, they
remain with the bank in full or exit entirely.
  18
     $2000 was chosen based on where we observed depositors bunching and based on how much interest they
may accumulate.
  19
     Iyer et al. (2016a) find similar behavior among uninsured Danish bank depositors: in response to bad
news about the bank during the financial crisis, they tended to follow the heuristic of splitting accounts in
half between two banks to achieve full insurance coverage.



                                                     17
above-market rates. We complete the section with a discussion of the policy implications of
this new finding.
    In the last year of its life, the bank attracted new, insured deposits, about half of which
arrived in the last 90 days before failure — when the bank was publicly known to be crit-
ically undercapitalized. Figure 3 shows that the inflows of insured term deposits from new
depositors to the bank totaled about $400 million, about a third of the bank’s deposit base
and roughly equal to the volume of fleeing deposits; because of these flows, the bank’s total
deposit balances declined little as the bank approached failure. Figure 2 shows term deposits
by various wholesale funding categories in the bank over time. This figure reveals that the
inflows represented a shift in deposit composition: as placed term deposits (and transaction
accounts) fled the bank, they were replaced by institutional term deposits, attracted mostly
through internet deposit listing services and held almost exclusively by small banks across
the country. Finally, Table 1 provides additional detail. Reflecting the fact that the new
deposits were structured to fall just under the insurance limit, only 0.6% of new deposit
accounts in the Formal period were uninsured, down from 4.0% in the Placebo period. Re-
latedly, the share of term deposits in new deposits is increasing over time; in the Formal
period, nearly 90% of new accounts were term deposits. Finally, 82% of new deposits in the
Formal period came from institutional depositors (Listed, Faxed, and Other Institutional),
up from 2.8% in the Placebo period.


4.1     Characteristics of New Depositors
Having shown that the bank saw substantial deposit inflows, especially late in life, we conduct
a classification regression analysis to characterize the differences between new and extant
depositors in each period. The dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the
depositor is new and 0 if the depositor is old, with the right hand side being a vector
of account characteristics.20 A zero coefficient on an explanatory variable signifies that
characteristic is equally distributed between new and old depositors, and a positive value
means it is more common among new depositors than old.
   Table 12 presents the results of these OLS regressions. The Uninsured dummy shows that
uninsured accounts are consistently and significantly 5 to 8 percentage points less common
among new depositors than existing depositors. The relative commonality of uninsured
accounts remains constant through time because, while the proportion of extant accounts
  20
     Throughout the paper, unless otherwise noted, a depositor is considered new in any given time period if
they open an account within the period and have never previously appeared in the bank’s deposit records.


                                                    18
that are uninsured at the bank falls over time, so does the proportion of new depositors that
are uninsured. Focusing on the effects of TAG, as shown by the TAG dummy, uninsured
checking accounts arrive in relatively large numbers in the Placebo period. This trend
reverses in the Pre-Crisis period with uninsured transaction accounts being rarer among
new depositors. However, suggesting that TAG was effective, in the Post-Crisis and Formal
periods, over-the-limit transaction accounts are equally prevalent among new and existing
depositors. The Checking dummy shows that checking deposits are less prevalent among new
depositors than existing depositors, and term deposits are more prevalent. This is consistent
with the low run-off rates of checking accounts and higher run-off rates of term deposits.
As checking accounts are less likely to liquidate, the extant population should have a higher
proportion of checking customers than the new population. Trust accounts, as indicated
by the Trust dummy, are also notably more common in the Post-Crisis and Formal period.
Finally, we see significant variation in wholesale deposits. We observe that Placed deposits
are less common among new depositors compared to old depositors in most periods, save
the Post-Crisis period, when we saw the highest inflows of such deposits in Figure 2. Faxed
and listing service deposits, while usually more common among new depositors than extant
ones due to high turnover, are drastically more common in the Formal period compared to
previous periods. A randomly selected listed or faxed deposit is 87 percentage points more
likely to be a new depositor than an old one as seen by its respective coefficient, all else equal.
Other institutional deposits are always more common amongst new depositors compared to
old depositors, although due to their small starting number, the Pre-Crisis period sees their
highest relative prevalence among new depositors.


4.2    Drivers of Gross Depositor Run-In
While the previous section illustrates the prevalence of certain depositor characteristics
among extant and new depositors, it does not explain the overall prevalence of new de-
positors compared to old depositors. This section builds upon the last by analyzing the time
series of new deposits as a share of total deposits. The left hand side of the regression is
the proportion of deposits that are new as of that day, while the explanatory variables are
time period dummies and macroeconomic controls. Among the time dummies, the omitted
period is the Placebo period, with dummies for the remaining three periods — Pre-Crisis,
Post-Crisis, and Formal — as well as dummies for the spans of time between those periods,
plus a prior-to-the-placebo dummy, for a total of seven dummies.
    Table 13 presents the regression estimates . Focusing first on the macroeconomic con-

                                                19
trols, we find coefficient estimates consistent with economic intuition. High stock market
volatility, as represented by Log(VIX) 21 , is positively associated with new deposit inflows,
as depositors seek safe and liquid assets. Higher GDP growth and stock returns are also
associated with higher deposit inflows, consistent with wealth effects. Other measures that
might impact aggregate deposit flows, such as housing starts or the bank’s growth profile,
are not statistically significant drivers of new deposits. The time series of new depositors’
share of deposits is also strongly persistent at the daily frequency, as shown by the positive
and significant AR(1) term.22
    Now consider the time period dummies in Table 13. Although many of the time dum-
mies are significant in specification 1, most become insignificant in specification 2 with the
addition of macroeconomic variables. However, even after the inclusion of macroeconomic
controls, two time dummies remain significant: Placebo to Pre-Crisis, and Formal. The
span between the Placebo and Pre-Crisis periods was a time of deposit growth for the bank,
and the dummy’s significance likely reflects this fact. More interestingly, we show that the
Formal period dummy remains significant and large in magnitude. Given our set of con-
trols summarizing macroeconomic conditions, this suggests that the inflows are explained by
bank-specific conditions.
    In fact, Figure 4 suggests the bank-specific cause was the high deposit rates offered by the
bank in the Formal period. The figure compares the rates the bank paid on newly issued 12-
month CDs, a common deposit product that is representative of the bank’s product portfolio
and relative market position, showing both the actual rate and its relative ranking along with
market percentiles.23 The figure shows the bank paid relatively high deposit rates throughout
its life. However, as deposits flowed in over the last year of its life, the bank consistently
paid rates above the 95th percentile of the industry distribution, often approaching the top
1%. Interestingly, the time period between the Placebo and Pre-Crisis periods, the other
time dummy that remains significant, is also a period in which the bank consistently paid
rates above the 95th percentile. Our evidence of the distressed bank raising deposit rates to
attract insured deposits is in line with predictions of Egan et al. (2017).
  21
     VIX is logged as it tends to span orders of magnitude and percentage interpretations are more appro-
priate.
  22
     Note that this is not a mechanical result of constructing the series with overlapping measurement periods,
as we define “new depositors” at the daily frequency.
  23
     Rather than taking the average deposit rate being paid on all 12-month CDs at each date, we construct
the series as the 31-day centered moving average of rates offered on newly issued term deposits. In this way,
the rate series better reflects the rate a hypothetical depositor would have faced had they approached the
bank on that date, and there also are some days in which no new 12-month CDs are issued.



                                                      20
4.3     Policy Implications of Run-In
Beyond the specifics of the studied bank, the run-in phenomenon we document has several
important policy implications. First, it suggests that depositor discipline was ineffective
in restraining bank risk-taking. While some depositors enforced discipline on the bank by
leaving, and new depositors were able to demand somewhat higher rates, new depositors
offset the disciplining effect by opening new accounts. This finding is important especially
because the Basel framework considers market (in this context, depositor) discipline of banks
to be the third of three “pillars” of financial stability, and our finding points to limited
disciplining power (among others, Martinez-Peria and Schmukler (1999); Park and Peristiani
(1998)). This supports the rationale behind increased regulatory scrutiny and discipline.
    Second and closely related, our finding emphasizes the importance of studying gross
deposit flows rather than net deposit flows in understanding the trade-off between bank
stability and moral hazard arising from deposit insurance. By making depositors less sensi-
tive to bank risk, deposit insurance stabilizes deposit funding; the run-in makes this effect
stronger. The run-in phenomenon may also prevent the socially inefficient failure of illiq-
uid but fundamentally solvent banks or provide time for orderly bank resolution. On the
other hand, less risk sensitive depositors also are less effective in restraining bank risk-taking,
making prudential supervision more crucial to financial stability.
    Third, the large inflow of new deposits suggests that deposit rate restrictions placed on
troubled banks are insufficient to prevent rapid insured deposit acquisition, certainly in a low
rate environment. Motivated by the depositor discipline and moral hazard concerns above,
US law and regulation prohibits less than well capitalized institutions from paying deposit
rates more than 75 basis points above the national average deposit rate on deposits solicited
nationally. The bank we study was subject to these restrictions during the Formal period,
and yet was able to attract deposits equal to around a third of its deposit base. The top
panel of Table 1 shows that the bank complied with the rate restrictions; the spread to the
market average on new accounts in the Formal period was around 69 basis points.24 Because
the bank was able to attract so many new deposits while under the restrictions, we conclude
the rate restrictions were at best a minimally binding constraint on the bank’s behavior.
  24
    Note that the spreads reported in the table are relative to our computed national average rate rather
than that defined by the FDIC. We calculate our own national average series using a method identical to
that used for the FDIC series. We use our computed series as the official data do not cover our entire sample
period, and we wish to keep series consistency across our sample. The source data underlying the official
average data changes with vintage, and we have not been able to recover the vintages used to construct the
FDIC series. As a result, our averages tend to differ slightly from the official data. Using the official data
over the supported period gives the same qualitative conclusions.


                                                     21
However, it remains unclear whether the rate caps would be more effective if short, riskless
rates were substantially above zero; the fed funds rate was at the zero lower bound for the
entire period in which the rate caps were in place for this bank. To the extent that the
dispersion of deposit rates is reduced when average rates are low (as suggested in Figure 4),
the 75bp cap on the deposit rate spread would be less binding while at the zero lower bound
compared to periods when rates are above it.
    The final reason that the shift in deposit composition matters to policymakers is that
it transfers risk to the FDIC. In addition to fleeing insured deposits, about $150 million of
uninsured transaction deposits also left. Because the bank replaced these fleeing uninsured
deposits with insured institutional term deposits, the share of the bank’s deposits covered
by insurance and the credit risk exposure of the FDIC increased as the bank approached
failure.


5    Generalization to Other Banks
The unusually granular data for this bank allows us to identify changes in deposit compo-
sition as it approached failure, but we unfortunately have such data for only a single bank.
When we initiated this project, we asked for data from a sample of 10 banks to be recovered
and put on a secure server on which we could access the data. We then examined deposit
data in each bank. Unfortunately, for many of the banks, the deposit data is incomplete. For
some of the banks, the data between systems cannot be appropriately linked; for example,
databases sometimes lack identifiers to link transactions (from one database, and necessary
for calculating account balances) with deposit accounts (from another database, necessary
for many permanent account characteristics) or customer systems (containing separate cus-
tomer characteristics.) Other banks might keep only the most recent three months of detailed
transaction history. Each bank has different storage and retention policies. Compounding
these data challenges is the fact that the data contain large volumes of sensitive and person-
ally identifiable information, such that access to the data is highly restricted, and uploading
the data to secure IT environments with statistical analysis software is time-consuming. Due
to the combination of these factors, it took well over a year for us to obtain access to data
for a sample of just 10 failed banks, and after analyzing their data, we determined only the
single bank we study had suitable deposit data. As reported earlier, for the bank we study,
we are confident that the deposit data are complete by matching to the Call Reports, but
this is not true for the other banks. Given these data constraints on micro data from failed


                                              22
banks, we use an alternative approach using a variety of other data sets available for a large
set of banks. This section analyzes a combination of public and private regulatory data to
demonstrate that our major findings generalize to other banks.
    To generalize our results, we use Call Report data for all US banks to investigate whether
banks that face a regulatory action see similar changes in deposit composition. In particular,
we investigate the impact of “treatment” with a regulatory action on five funding measures.
The five funding measures are the share of each bank’s total deposit funding in the form
of brokered deposits, listing service deposits, small term deposits (those under $100,000),
medium term deposits (those over $100,000 but under $250,000), and large term deposits
(those over $250,000).25 Each series is regressed on a dummy (“treatment”) variable for
whether or not the bank was facing regulatory action similar to the studied bank, as well
as a set of control variables. We define a bank to be facing regulatory action if it is under
a formal enforcement action that includes capital-related provisions or if it is less than
well capitalized26 without specific written permission from the regulator to continue taking
brokered deposits, usually referred to as a brokered deposit waiver. Less than well capitalized
institutions are forbidden from taking new brokered deposits or rolling over old ones unless
they have a brokered deposit waiver. Note that any bank meeting our definition of regulatory
treatment will also be subject to deposit rate restrictions. The treatment variable is defined
using data from public Call Reports and confidential FDIC data, which provides the details
of the enforcement actions and brokered deposit waivers. The advantage of this approach
is that it gives us a large panel of banks — around 10,000 banks, of which 2,358 faced
regulatory action.
    The control variables are derived from Call Reports. Control variables are non-performing
assets as share of assets, to capture bank health; one-year asset growth rate, to capture the
growth and current risk profile of the bank; the natural logarithm of assets, to capture size;
deposits as a share of assets, to capture the banks’ reliance on deposits generally; and term
deposits as a share of deposits, to capture their reliance on term deposits particularly.27 We
  25
     The average bank in our sample has 3.1% of its deposits classified as brokered, 1.6% as listed, 20.2% as
small term deposits, 13.1% as medium term deposits, and 5.5% as large term deposits.
  26
     See 12 U.S.C. §1831o for capital category definitions.
  27
     We altered the raw Call Report data by correcting for apparent reporting errors and by winsorizing.
Specifically, in a handful of bank-quarters, banks appear to have reported brokered deposits in dollars,
inconsistent with the Call Report standard of thousands of dollars, requiring us to divide by 1000. When
funding shares calculated from Call Reports were a fraction of a percent above 100% or below 0%, we assume
this is due to rounding error, and we round to 100% or 0%, respectively. Finally, we bounded one-year asset
growth rates between −50% and 100%, affecting about 2% of bank-quarters, with large asset shifts usually due
to new small banks growing rapidly in the first few quarters. Importantly, none of these changes materially



                                                     23
use quarterly data for all US banks from 2000 to 2016, with 2,358 banks facing regulatory
action and 9,158 not facing them at some point during this time. However, because we rely
on the Call Report taxonomy of deposit accounts and because this taxonomy has changed
through time, some regressions use shorter samples.28 Note that regressions also include
bank and quarter fixed effects.
    Finally, we conduct our analysis under three different model specifications. Two of the
specifications are simple OLS models and differ only in the specification of the treatment
dummy. In one, we have a single treatment dummy which is equal to one in any bank-
quarter where regulatory action was in place; in this case, the untreated (“control”) group
is all banks not contemporaneously under a regulatory action. In another, we use separate
dummy variables for each quarter from four quarters before the imposition of treatment
to four quarters after, plus an additional dummy for five or more quarters of continuous
treatment; in this case, the control group is banks which will not face such action for at
least the next four quarters. Finally, we estimate a third specification on propensity-score-
matched banks. Banks’ propensity to be treated is determined by a logistic regression using
the same covariates as in the above regressions, plus contemporaneous term deposit size
shares. Then, banks with similar propensity scores — where one was treated and the other
was not — are compared after four quarters of continuous treatment to observe the effects
of that treatment. The results are consistent across all specifications.
    Table 14 shows the results of regressions with a single regulatory action dummy variable.
Consistent with our earlier findings, banks under regulatory action reduce their reliance on
brokered deposits while increasing listing service deposits. These two compositional shifts do
not completely offset one another, but banks may also be seeking other classes of deposits.
In addition, there is an increase in the reliance on term deposits below $100,000 as well as
between $100,000 and $250,000, with a decrease in deposits above $250,000.
    Table 15 and the accompanying Figure 5 demonstrate the time path of the effects of
regulatory action on the same deposit categories. Relative to banks who are more than
four quarters away from regulatory action, banks one to four quarters before an action
have statistically significantly more brokered deposits. Following the application of such
restrictions, these banks become much less likely to source such deposits, reflecting the
affects the point estimates of the treatment variable.
   28
      Listing service deposits were not separately identified or reported on Call Reports before the first quarter
of 2011, and data necessary to disaggregate term deposits by size is available beginning in 2010. This limited
our listing service deposit sample to 559 treated and 7,020 untreated banks and our term deposit sample to
807 treated and 7,141 untreated banks.



                                                       24
concurrent application of brokered deposit restrictions. The exact opposite pattern appears
with listing service deposits, with banks prior to such events having fewer and those after
having more. Presumably, this pattern reflects inflows of listing service deposits conceptually
similar to those documented previously. Small time deposits are relatively more prevalent
in banks in the last few quarters before regulatory action than in the control group, and the
difference becomes even more stark after regulatory action. Medium time deposits make up
a smaller share of funding at banks prior to regulatory action compared to the control group,
but also become more common following regulatory action. Finally, large time deposits are
equally as common among banks far from regulatory action as well as those within only a few
quarters of action, but they become much less common among banks following regulatory
action. Table 16 shows that our generalization results are robust to using a propensity-score-
matched specification.
    This analysis generalizes our earlier findings along several dimensions. These regressions
consistently find that banks under regulatory action reduce reliance on brokered deposits
(due to concurrently applied brokered deposit restrictions) and deposits above the insurance
limit (reflecting the flight of uninsured depositors from the ailing bank). These regressions
show that banks under regulatory action increase reliance on listing service deposits, much
as the bank featured earlier in this paper did. Treated banks also increase reliance on term
deposits under the insurance limit, and especially those between $100,000 and $250,000.
Recall that the bank featured earlier in this paper structured most of its new term deposits
during the Formal period to fall just under the insurance limit — within this range.


6      Run-Off, Run-In, and Regulatory Liquidity Ratios
As a final empirical exercise, we use our novel failed bank data as an opportunity to evaluate
the deposit run-off rates assumed in the two post-crisis liquidity ratios, LCR and NSFR.29 It is
of independent interest to empirically assess new liquidity regulations; in fact, several scholars
have recently bemoaned the dearth of independent academic research in this area (Diamond
and Kashyap (2016), Allen and Gale (2017)). Our analysis highlights the importance of
gross flows to understanding aggregate run-off rates. The rules’ deposit run-off rates can be
thought of as net rates. Most scholars focus on outflows; our paper contributes by showing
  29
    The rules were initially proposed by the Basel Committee and are being implemented by country-level
supervisory agencies. We focus on the US supervisory agencies’ final LCR rule (Federal Register (2014)),
as well as their proposed NSFR rule (Federal Register (2016)). The US agencies have not yet finalized the
NSFR rule. Note that the results would be little changed if we used the Basel proposals instead.


                                                   25
the importance of gross inflows in materially affecting overall deposit flows. We find that
the deposit run-off rate assumptions in the LCR are higher than the run-off behavior we see
in this bank, but that the proposed US NSFR rule assumes run-off rates lower than seen at
our bank.30
    Given the nature of our data, our analysis focuses solely on run-off rate assumptions for
deposit products in the two liquidity ratios. Thus, we are not assessing other aspects of the
rules, such as the liquidity of assets. We compute the rule-implied aggregate deposit run-off
rate for the bank by categorizing all accounts into the relevant LCR/NSFR run-off categories
and then taking the value-weighted average of the categories’ assumed run-off rates.
    We find an area of potential regulatory arbitrage in the rules related to operational
deposits. Operational deposits are business deposits which are maintained at the bank as
part of an arrangement in which the bank provides clearing, custodial, or cash management
services, including accounts used for payroll. Operational deposit balances are assumed to
be more stable and thus have a lower assumed run-off rate than non-operational business
deposits. There are guidelines on how to determine the division of accounts and bank
supervisors review banks methodologies, but banks have the incentive and some discretion
to overstate the operational share of their business deposit balances so as to make their
funding appear more stable.31 To reflect this incentive, we construct a range of rule-implied
run-off rates; the bottom of the range reflects the assumption that all deposits which could
be operational actually are, and the top of the range treats them as nonoperational.
    Our analysis suggests that the LCR deposit run-off rates are about as high as the runoff
we observe in stressed periods. The results are shown in top panel of Figure 6, where net
declines in deposit balances (aggregate run-off) are represented with positive values and
increases in deposit balances (aggregate run-in) are negative. At no point does the observed
run-off exceed the maximum value of the LCR-consistent range, though it comes fairly close
in 2008. In that period, for many allocations of business deposits between operational and
non-operational categories, the bank’s run-off would have exceeded the rules assumed rate.
    In contrast, we find evidence that our bank experienced run-off exceeding the NSFR run-
off rate (Figure 6, bottom panel), reflecting NSFR’s design-intent to improve bank funding
stability over more normal business conditions than the stress-focused LCR. Run-off exceeds
the NSFR range both in the period of system-wide anxiety around the crisis and subsequent
to the publication of bank-specific adverse information in the year before failure. In the
  30
     We acknowledge that our quantitative results here should be interpreted with some caution: the bank
we study would not be subject to the rules even if it still existed, as it was too small.
  31
     These guidelines are enforced through detailed examiner enforcement and attention.


                                                  26
former case, the observed runoff exceeds the rule-implied range regardless of the treatment
of run-in. In the year the before failure, only the gross outflows would exceed the NSFR
threshold.


7    Conclusion
In this paper we use a highly granular and unique dataset to identify important new findings
related to deposit inflows and outflows in a failing bank. Our most important finding is
that gross deposit inflows are of first order impact in failing banks’ balance sheets, despite
the banks’ elevated default risk and supervisory actions meant to prevent costly and rapid
deposit acquisition. This result strongly supports the notion that deposit insurance increases
the willingness of depositors to fund banks, as it supports cheap lending to a highly leveraged
firm. This mechanism may prevent the inefficient failure of solvent banks facing liquidity
issues, potentially a positive outcome. On a more negative note, it may also reflect the other
side of insurance — moral hazard. Finally, that the bank attracted these inflows through the
comparatively new channel of internet listing services stands as a warning that technological
innovation can open new avenues for moral hazard.
    We identify a number of policy-relevant findings related to gross deposit outflows. Most
importantly, we provide further evidence that deposit insurance improves funding stability.
We also provide the first empirical evidence that temporary, crisis-era expansions of deposit
insurance, such as FDIC’s TAG, are as effective as ordinary deposit insurance. Many of
our findings on outflows agree with the intuition already written into regulations, such as
that checking accounts and accounts receiving regular direct deposits are more stable. Other
findings may be somewhat less intuitive, such as the fact that, despite their lack of demand-
ability, term deposits are more risk sensitive and unstable than demandable deposits. We
then demonstrate that our main findings generalize to other banks by using a combination
of public regulatory filings and confidential supervisory data. Finally, we illustrate the im-
portance of understanding and measuring both outflows and inflows by demonstrating the
sensitivity of LCR and NSFR to assumptions on measurements of inflows. This exercise also
provides evidence as to the realism of deposit run-off rates assumed in the rules.

              low or lower for at least 61 days, which includes the account closing. This dummy captures a
              generally accepted notion of account liquidation consistent with related studies (for example,
              Iyer and Puri (2012)). Results in this paper are robust to different thresholds of 75%, 90%,
              and 95%.

Uninsured     A dummy variable equal to 1 if there are any uninsured balances in the account as of the
              start of the measurement period. Deposit insurance limits apply separately to different
              ownership types, so we account separately for individual, corporate, municipal, joint, IRA,
              employee benefit plans, revocable trust, and irrevocable trust ownership categories. An
              exact insurance determination can sometimes be difficult, as joint and trust accounts have
              complex ownership structures which are often incompletely documented, hence we construct
              this variable conservatively. Accounts we flag as insured have all funds insured. Accounts
              we flag as uninsured should have some uninsured funds in them, but it is possible that they
              are occasionally covered because of complex joint ownership. As a result, estimates in our
              regressions are lower bounds on the effects of being over the FDIC insurance limit.

Covered by    A dummy variable equal to 1 if the accounts was covered by additional, temporary guarantee
TAG/DFA       schemes in the years after the financial crisis as of the start of the regression period; 0
              otherwise. The two additional guarantee schemes were the Transaction Account Guarantee
              (TAG) program and guarantees from by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA). TAG, a sub-program
              of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), placed temporary but
              unlimited (in dollar terms) guarantees on products which comprise all categories of checking
              accounts at this bank. These guarantees were in force from October 14, 2008 until December
              31, 2010. The DFA guarantees similarly provided unlimited insurance for non-interest-
              bearing demand deposit accounts and IOLTA accounts, but not NOW accounts. The DFA
              guarantees were in force from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2012.

Direct        A dummy variable equal to 1 if the account is receiving an ACH deposit roughly every two
Deposit       weeks as of the start of the regression period; 0 otherwise, and always 0 for term deposits.

Log(Age)      The natural log of the years elapsed since the primary account holder first appears in the
              bank’s deposit records, as of the start of the regression period. If an individual was a
              secondary depositor on an account before they became a primary account holder on another
              account, or closed an older account, we use the date at which the original account was
              opened. Relationship age serves as a measure of the depth of the depositor relationship.
              The age of the account is dated differently in the case of placed deposits; see placed deposits
              below for details.

Log(Days to   The natural log of the number of days until the maturity of the account, as of the start of
Maturity)     the regression period. This is defined only for term accounts.



              This table defines the variables used in the regressions of Section 3.

Variable         Definition
Prior            The proportion of days in the past year, as of the start of the measurement period, in
Transactions     which the account holder performed at least one transaction involving the account under
                 study. A value of 0 thus implies no activity and 100 implies activity every day. We exclude
                 transactions which are exogenous to the depositor such as monthly interest credits or fees.
                 This serves as another measure of depositors’ relationship depth. This variable is always 0
                 for term accounts.

Institutional-   A dummy variable equal to 1 if the deposit is owned by a bank, savings association, credit
Listed/Faxed     union, financial corporate, municipality, or non-financial corporation, or if it is a “business”
                 product type as marked in the bank’s records; 0 otherwise. Additionally, the deposit must
                 have been opened via an internet listing service or facsimile as identified by the bank’s
                 records. We group faxed deposits with listed because internal bank documentation, depositor
                 behavior, and depositor types (namely, small depository institutions making up a large
                 portion of these deposits towards the end of the bank’s life) all indicate that the faxed
                 deposits were almost exclusively gathered from depositors who saw the rates on listing
                 services and then faxed their deposit request to the bank. This excludes third-party deposit
                 placement services (such as deposit brokers) as we capture these entities with a separate
                 dummy variable.

Institutional-   A dummy variable exactly defined As Institutional - Listed/Faxed above, but we have no
Other            evidence that the deposits were received from a listing service or facsimile order.

Placed           A dummy variable equal to 1 if the deposit was placed by a fiduciary or deposit broker
                 instead of by an individual depositor; 0 otherwise and always 0 for transaction accounts.
                 Many term deposits at the bank are not held by individuals but instead held by institutions
                 acting as fiduciaries for others, and these fiduciaries do not consistently reveal the identity
                 of the underlying holders of the account to the bank. These deposits reflect a less personal
                 connection with the bank. For these accounts, the age of the account variable is dated
                 to the start of the individual account, not the first relationship of the reported holder of
                 the account, as the reported holder is only a fiduciary that may not make final renewal
                 and withdrawal decisions. Note that we assume all placed deposits are insured, which is
                 supported by internal FDIC analysis of several failed banks and the websites of the deposit
                 placement services present at the studied bank, as they advertise that they structure their
                 deposits so as to achieve full insurance coverage.

Trust            A dummy variable equal to 1 if the account is held by a trust and 0 otherwise. This does
                 include Payable on Death (POD) arrangements. Trust accounts require effort to establish,
                 and they are a useful legal device more for wealthier or more complex depositors. As such,
                 we expect accounts held in trust to represent more sophisticated end-depositors.



                 This table defines the variables used in the regressions of Section 3.

Estimates from Cox proportional hazard, linear probability, and probit models for the prob-
ability of account liquidation during the post-crisis period. Liquidation is defined as with-
drawing more than 50% of the account balance and remaining below that level for 61 days
or more. Cox estimates are expressed as hazard ratios, LPM estimates are OLS coefficient
estimates, and Probit estimates are marginal effects. T-statistics are in parentheses. Es-
timates significant at 1% are denoted with ∗∗∗ , 5% with ∗∗ , and 10% with ∗ . Column (4)
indicates whether the hazard rate for the Cox model (in column (1)) is statistically different
from the corresponding estimate in the Placebo period. Differences significant at the 1%
level are represented by , 5% by , and 10% by .

Estimates from Cox proportional hazard, linear probability, and probit models for the prob-
ability of account liquidation in response to the formal enforcement action. Liquidation is
defined as withdrawing more than 50% of the account balance and remaining below that
level for 61 days or more. Cox estimates are expressed as hazard ratios, LPM estimates
are OLS coefficient estimates, and Probit estimates are marginal effects. T-statistics are in
parentheses. Estimates significant at 1% are denoted with ∗∗∗ , 5% with ∗∗ , and 10% with ∗ .
Column (4) indicates whether the hazard rate for the Cox model (in column (1)) is statisti-
cally different from the corresponding estimate in the Placebo period. Differences significant
at the 1% level are represented by , 5% by , and 10% by .

Estimates of account-level regressions, with one observation per account that is extant at the
start of that period or that will arrive during that period, of a dummy variable which equals
one for newly arrived depositors’ accounts and zero otherwise, on account characteristics.
The results show what deposit(or) attributes were associated with new deposit(or)s. All
models are estimated with OLS. T-statistics are in parentheses. Estimates significant at 1%
are denoted with ∗∗∗ , 5% with ∗∗ , and 10% with ∗ .

Estimates from regressing funding shares on a regulatory action dummy and bank-level
controls for all US banks from 2000 to 2016. The regulatory action dummy is based on
public and confidential supervisory data; other variables are from the regulatory filings of
all US banks. Observational units are bank-quarters, with brokered deposit data available
from 2000 to 2016, listing service deposits from 2011 to 2016, and all other term deposit data
from 2010 to 2016. Small term deposits are those with balances of $100,000 or less; medium
term deposits are between $100,001 and $250,000; and large term deposits are those over
$250,000. T-statistics in parentheses. Estimates significant at 1% are denoted with ∗∗∗ , 5%
with ∗∗ , and 10% with ∗ .

Estimates from propensity-score-matching for a regulatory treatment based on bank covari-
ates to measure the effects on certain deposit products as a share of total deposits for all US
Banks. The regulatory action dummy is based on a combination of public and confidential
supervisory data; all other variables are from the regulatory filings of all US banks. Observa-
tion units are bank-quarters, with brokered deposit data available from 2000 to 2016, listing
service deposits from 2011 to 2016, and all other term deposit data from 2010 to 2016. Only
banks that at some time come under an enforcement action between 2000-2016 are used for
matching. T-statistics in parentheses. Matching is done using a logistic model to generate a
propensity score for being treated with regulatory action based on the covariates used in the
above regressions (1 year asset growth, natural log of assets, nonperforming loans as share
of assets, deposits as a share of assets) as well as all outcome variables (brokered deposits,
listing service deposits, all three categories of term deposits; as shares of deposits). Then
treated banks in one quarter are matched to untreated banks in the same quarter at the
time of treatment based on this score. Matches are done based on normal kernel weighting,
so that close matches are weighted proportionally more. We then observe the difference
between treated and untreated 4 quarters after treatment.

bars denote the time periods analyzed in the regressions of Section 3, and overlaid text iden-
tifies the name of each period. Note that the dramatic, brief spike in uninsured transaction
deposits between the Post-Crisis and Formal periods reflects a single transaction in which
another subsidiary of the bank’s holding company passed funds through the bank in such a
manner that they remained within the bank for a few days.

Term deposit account balances in brokered accounts (dash-dotted red), placed accounts
(dotted green), institutional deposits obtained via rate listing services and faxes (bold blue),
and other institutional deposits (solid, thin purple). Placed deposits are those placed by
a third party on behalf the underlying depositor, where that third party does not meet
the definition of deposit broker. Note that this is a different notion of placed deposits
relative to that used in the regressions; here, we split placed and brokered deposits into two
categories, whereas both were grouped as “placed” in the regressions. Among placed and
brokered deposits, the underlying depositors are often not identified to the bank accepting
the deposits. Grey bars denote the time periods analyzed in the regressions of Section 3,
and overlaid text identifies the name of each period.

31-day moving average (fifteen days before, day of, and fifteen days after) of all rates offered
by the bank on newly issued 12-month term deposits with balances below $100,000 (“Bank
Average;” solid red line) shown on the left axis, while the percentile relative to the distribu-
tion of banking industry rates (from RateWatch) for the same product is on the right axis.
The bank average series is a measure of the rate which would have been faced by a depositor
considering depositing funds at the bank that day. “Newly issued” term deposits include
newly established term deposit accounts as well as rollovers of existing term deposits upon
the expiration of the previous product.

Graphical presentation of the impact of regulatory action on funding shares, using the es-
timates from Table 15. Small term deposits are those with balances of $100,000 or less;
medium term deposits are between $100,001 and $250,000; and large term deposits are those
over $250,000. Time period t is the quarter in which the enforcement action was issued.
Error bands represent 95% asymptotic confidence intervals.

Observed run-off rates versus those assumed in the LCR (top panel) and NSFR (bottom
panel). Grey intervals present ranges of run-off rates consistent with rules, where the ranges
arise from uncertainty as to the share of business deposits which are considered operational;
the extremes of the grey intervals correspond to the parameterizations wherein either all or
no business deposits are operational. The solid blue and dotted red lines show observed run-
off considering all depositors and only depositors who were at the bank as of the calculation
date, respectively. All run-off rates are calculated in a forward-looking manner. That is, at
any given date, the plotted values correspond to run-off observed over the following 30 days
(LCR) or year (NSFR).
