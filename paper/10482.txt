This paper develops and simulates a dynamic model of strategic telecom competition. The goal is to understand how
regulatory policy, particularly relative to lease charges for local network elements, affects telecom competition,
investment, retail prices, and consumer welfare. The model assumes two products, local voice service and data
(broadband), and three types of players n the regional Bell operating companies, referred to as incumbent local
exchange carriers (ILECs), cable companies (Cables), and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). The game
begins with a) ILECs established in each county with respect to the provision of local voice and data services and
b) Cables established in roughly half of the counties with respect to the provision of data.There are one-time fixed
costs of entering a county, product- and period-specific costs of operating in a county, and marginal costs of
supplying each product. Economies of scope reduce the fixed entry and operating costs of supplying both products
in a given county at a given point in time. Finally, in supplying telecom services in a given county, CLECs may enter
by leasing ILEC infrastructure at specified access rates. The requirement that ILECs allow CLECs to lease their local
network facilities was established in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as part of a quid pro quo that promised
ILECs entry into the long distance market. But the ILECs continue to contest the quid. The ILECs support their
position by suggesting that leased access reduces telecom investment and output and raises telecom prices. Our
model considers the entire range of options available to each of the players, but it reaches the opposite conclusion.
Indeed, we find thatif UNE-P rates were set at the Supreme Court-approved total element long-run incremental cost
(TELRIC) levels, telecom investment and employment outlays would increase by over one fifth in counties
containing the majority of the U.S. population and by over 30 percent in counties containing almost a third of the
population. The present value of telecom outlays over the next 5 and 20 years would rise by $71 billion and $155
billion, respectively. On average, the switch from actual to TELRIC UNE rates would lower local phone rates across
the country’s 3108 counties by $57 per year, generating annual total savings to consumers of $15 billion. Almost
two fifths of the population would experience reductions in local phone rates of 20 percent or more. Over one fifth
would experience rate reductions of 30 percent or more. These findings of price reductions are based on a fairly
conservative parameterization of our model with respect to the specification of true ILEC and CLEC incremental
long-run production costs.

I. Introduction

           A vibrant telecom sector is remarkably important to national economic

performance. Two-thirds of U.S. economic growth appears driven by innovations in

information technology.3 And telecom, which plays an essential role in information

acquisition and dissemination, accounts for the lion’s share of IT investment and

innovation.        Unfortunately, after booming during the second half of the 1990s, the

telecom industry has fallen on hard times.4

           What explains the decline in the telecom sector? The regional Bell operating

companies, referred to as ILECs (incumbent local exchange carriers), blame it on their

competitors, known as CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers). The CLECs blame

it on the ILECs and the failure of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to

vigorously enforce the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TA96). This act required the

ILECs to lease, at wholesale rates, telephone lines and the other bottleneck facilities they

control to CLECs so that CLECs too could market local voice and broadband services.

To ensure ILEC compliance with its provisions, TA96 dangled a very big carrot, namely

allowing ILECs to enter the long distance market.

           According to the CLECs, the ILECs have used every means at their disposal to

stymie competition based on leased access and have failed to comply not only with the

spirit, but also with the letter of TA96. For their part, the ILECs claim that competition

based on leased access is synthetic and greatly limits their own incentives to invest.

While the two sides have been arguing, the FCC has made three decisions that will

significantly affect future competition in telecom. The first is to permit all four regional

Bell operating companies to enter the long distance market notwithstanding the fact that

CLECs have yet to secure more than 15 percent of the local voice market.5 The second is

to reaffirm the role of state public utility commissions (PUCs) in setting conditions under

which CLECs can lease either individual ILEC facilities or “platforms” of interconnected

ILEC telephone lines, switches, and transport services. This latter option is referred to as

UNE-P, which stands for unbundled network element platform, because in renting these

elements, the CLECs are, in effect, leasing the entire platform of local network voice

elements. In providing their final retail voice services under UNE-P, the CLECs bring to

these wholesale network-inputs significant customer support and product differentiation.6

         The alternative to competing for voice services under UNE-P is for CLECs to

obtain physical access to customer loops by collocating equipment in ILEC central

offices. Leasing access in this manner is called UNE-L (unbundled network element

loop) because it entails disconnecting the telephone line or loop from the ILEC’s switch

and reconnecting it to the CLEC’s equipment. This physical re-termination of the loop is

called the hot cut process. Competing under UNE-L turns out to be very difficult, and

often impossible, due to an array of significant operational and cost impediments.7

  The rental of network services at wholesale rates is routine in the long distance and wireless markets. The
main difference is that in long distance and wireless markets, there are competing carriers, whereas in the
local voice and broadband market, the ILECs have a virtual monopoly over the transmission infrastructure.
Ironically, AT&T is one of the largest CLECs. When the Bell Telephone Company was broken up in 1983
into a single long-distance provider, AT&T was compelled to lease access to its long-distance lines. Today
the ILECs are leasing these and other long-distance lines to transmit their customers’ voice and data
messages. I.e., in the long distance market, both sets of shoes are on different feet.
7
 Operational impediments include the considerable time the ILECs take to implement hot cuts and the
mistakes, whether intentional or not, that they make in the process. The costs CLECs face in operating
under UNE-L include the significant expense of collocating their equipment in the ILEC central offices, of

        The third FCC decision grants ILECs what, over time, could amount to exclusive

use of local phone lines to provide high-speed broadband service.8 Specifically, the FCC

has indicated that if ILECs add additional fiber to their transmission networks they are no

longer required to unbundle (lease out) the use of that fiber to those CLECs seeking to

market broadband under UNE-L.

        These three FCC decisions have been made against the backdrop of an intense

ILEC-CLEC battle over the proper pricing of UNEs. The ILECs appealed the FCC’s

Total Element Long-Run Incremental Cost (TELRIC) UNE pricing formula all the way to

the Supreme Court and lost. But on the heels of the Supreme Court’s affirmation of

TELRIC, the FCC has opened a proceeding to investigate whether this standard needs to

be revised9 – and the ILECs continue to contest UNE pricing at the state level,

particularly in states that have begun lowering their leasing rates toward TELRIC levels.

Those states that have dropped their UNE rates have seen a significant increase in UNE-P

based competition, and their residents have seen their local phone bills drop by as much

as one third.10


renting collocation space from the ILECs, of backhauling loops from the ILEC central offices to their own
networks, and of switching transmissions. For CLECs to provide broadband service, they need to have
physical access to the loop, which means entering the market under UNE-L. But given the high costs and
operational impediments of UNE-L, CLECS that provide broadband under UNE-L typically provision the
voice service under UNE-P.
8
 The latter two decisions were part of the FCC’s Triennial Review of UNEs Order that was announced on
February 20, 2003. Subsequently, the FCC issued detailed regulations implementing its February decision.
These regulations state that ILECs will no longer be required to unbundle facilities to CLECs for purpose
of data transmission to the extent that these facilities are either modernized or expanded to provide high-
speed fiber optic capacity.

       Given the importance of regulatory policy to the telecom industry and the

importance of the industry to the economy, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of

how the telecom sector operates and responds to government actions. This paper seeks to

contribute to that understanding by developing and simulating a new dynamic strategic

model of telecom entry, pricing, and investment.

       Our model features two products -- local voice service and data (broadband) --

and three types of players – ILECs, CABLES, and CLECS. The playing field consists of

the 3,108 counties in the continental United States. The game begins with a) ILECs

providing both local voice and data services in each county; and b) CABLES providing

data service in roughly half of the counties. CLECs must decide if and when to enter

each county and what products to market in those counties they enter. Multiple equilibria

in the entry game are resolved via a randomization mechanism that selects equilibria with

equal probability. Post-entry market supplies and product prices are determined via

Cournot competition.

       There are one-time fixed costs of entering a county, product- and period-specific

costs of operating in the county, and marginal costs of supplying each product. There are

also economies of scope that reduce the fixed entry and operating costs of supplying both

products in a given county at a given point in time. Finally, in supplying voice in a given

county, CLECs can potentially lower their costs by leasing ILEC unbundled network

infrastructure at specified access rates.

       The model’s central message is that TELRIC UNE-based competition can be

highly effective in lowering voice and broadband prices, enhancing consumer welfare,

and resurrecting telecom investment. But the key to making UNE competition work




                                            4
appears to be having state PUCs set platform rental rates at true TELRIC levels, which,

we estimate, averages about $15.10 per line per month.11 Thus far, only a few state PUCs

have set their UNE-P rates close to what we measure to be their own state-specific

TELRIC levels. Indeed, average state-specific actual UNE-P rates exceed this estimate

of average TELRIC UNE-P rates by 27.9 percent.

           Our model indicates that if UNE rates were set at TELRIC levels throughout the

country, telecom entry, investment and employment outlays, and output would increase

significantly and local voice prices would fall significantly. That is, telecom investment

and employment outlays would increase by over 20 percent in counties containing the

majority of the U.S. population and by over 30 percent in counties containing almost a

third of the population – compared with the outlays that we may expect to occur under a

continuation of current above-TELRIC UNE prices. In particular, improved adherence to

TELRIC would increase telecom investment outlays by $71 billion over the next 5 years.

And the present value of these outlays over the next 20 years would increase by $155

billion.

           A switch in each state from current to TELRIC UNE rates would lower local

phone prices, on average, across the country’s 3108 counties by $57 per household per

year for an aggregate savings of $15.0 billion per year. Almost two-fifths of households

would experience reductions in local phone rates of 20 percent or more. Over one fifth

would experience rate reductions of 30 percent or more.



11
   Our rough estimate of TELRIC rates starts with rates calculated from the FCC’s 1998 Synthesis Model
adjusted to report UNE costs. These rates are then deflated for 5 years at a 5 percent per year to account for
intervening reductions in input prices and unit costs. This uniform nationwide calculation provides only a
rough index of state-by-state TELRICs and should not be construed to support or impeach more targeted,
specific calculations of TELRIC.


                                                      5
           The gains from TELRIC-based UNE-based competition are significant across the

entire spectrum of counties arrayed by income and population density. Almost a fifth of

households in low-income – low-density counties begin to enjoy local voice competition

when the switch is made from current to TELRIC UNE rates. And households and

business in such counties experience an 8.7 percent reduction in the cost of their local

phone service.

           These findings are based on a fairly conservative parameterization of our model

with respect to the specification of true ILEC and CLEC incremental long-run production

costs. With arguably more realistic parameters, the average price of local phone service

would fall by more than one third in moving from current to TELRIC UNE rates. And

much greater price reductions would arise in the voice market were the government to

require electronic loop provisioning, under which a customer’s local voice transmissions

would be switched electronically and instantaneously to CLEC facilities at the same

extraordinary low cost as occurs in the long distance market.12 Our simulations also

show significant entry by CLECs in broadband. Indeed, across cross-county average

broadband price under TELRIC pricing of UNEs ends up almost 22.9 percent lower than

the regulated monopoly price.

           In contrast to our findings about the gains from UNE-based competition with

proper TELRIC pricing, the model indicates that current UNE pricing by some state

PUCs is a mixed blessing. PUCs that set UNE prices far above TELRIC can actually end

up raising voice prices, lowering demand for telecom services, and reducing telecom

investment and employment outlays. The reason stems from our assumption that state

PUCs will phase out their regulation of local retail telecom prices at the first sign of

                                                      6
competition from CLECs. Such eventual regulatory “relief” is one of the long-term goals

of TA96. But if wholesale prices for UNEs are set too high, competitors will be unable

to provide service economically to all customers, and substantial segments of the market

will be served only by a now unregulated monopolist or by an unregulated dominant

market player. The resulting “free” market price likely will be higher than the price

previously set by the regulators.               Stated differently, a regulated monopoly may be

preferred to an unregulated duopoly or oligopoly if the ILEC can persuade state PUCs to

maintain above-TELRIC UNE prices and, thereby, raise their rivals’ costs. Thus, state

PUCs should understand that abandoning regulation at the first sign of competition may

have very adverse consequences, and that limited competition may be a very poor

substitute for full and fair competition.

           This paper reaches its pro-competitive conclusions after considering the empirical

evidence, reviewing basic lessons about monopoly behavior, and simulating our model

for all 3108 counties in the continental United States.13 We proceed in section 2 by

describing the recent rise and fall of telecom investment.                       Section 3 considers the

argument that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TA96) is responsible for the

industry’s recent distress. Section 4 presents our model. Section 5 delivers findings, and

Section 6 concludes.



2. The Telecom Investment Boom and Bust

           Table 1 shows total telecom investment since 1990 as well as the investment of

the CLECs and ILECs. It is clear that TA96 triggered a huge expansion of investment. It

did so by promising CLECs that they would receive access to the local network or
13
     Unfortunately, critical data needed to run the model are not available for either Alaska or Hawaii.

components (elements) of the local network at a reasonable price and on a timely basis.

The local network refers to the local telephone lines, telephone poles, underground

conduits, and switches that connect the American public to the outside word.

          TA96 expanded use of this vital communications pipeline bottleneck by a)

eliminating the ILECs’ legal status as monopoly franchises and b) requiring the ILECs to

rent access to the local network to incipient, would-be competitors. The act further

required the ILECs to rent access to (to unbundle) the local network on either a

component-by-component basis or on a package-of-components basis as requested by

their competitors.14 Finally, rents were to be set at a compensatory price that included a

profit.

          During the 1996-2000 telecom investment boom, over a third of gross and over

one half of net telecom investment was done by the CLECs even though they were fifteen

times smaller than the ILECs when measured in terms of revenues.15 In 2000, at the peak

of the investment boom, CLECs invested $25 billion, which almost matched the $27

billion of new ILEC investment.

          Despite investing two-thirds of their revenues, as compared to one quarter by the

ILECs, CLECs were able to gain only 8.5 percent of nationwide access lines, and only

4.6 percent of residential and small business lines, by the end of 2000. The explanation

for this is straightforward. CLECs concentrated their investment in dense metropolitan




14
  Because local network assets were acquired by the ILECs under concessionary conditions and paid for by
the public over decades in the form of high, regulated telephone rates for local and long distance telephone
calls, even these “compensatory” rents may be too high.

areas to a) capture scale and density economies and b) bypass ILEC control of the local

network by constructing their own pipelines feeding into high-traffic office buildings.16

        Over the past seven years, state PUCs have adopted a “look-see” approach to

lowering UNE-P rates and vigorously enforcing TA96. They have looked to preserve

ILEC profitability, while also seeing how much competition their policies would

engender. Recently, PUCs in a number of major states, including New York, California,

Illinois, and Michigan, have lowered their UNE rates toward TELRIC levels and have

required their ILECs to expedite the unbundling process. In these states, CLEC market

shares have risen and local voice and broadband retail prices have fallen.17

        The surge in telecom investment in the last decade was not unique to the United

States. According to a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

(OECD) review of telecommunications policy in OECD member nations, “The evidence

indicates that opening access networks and network elements to competitive forces

increases investment and the pace of development. Nearly all OECD governments have



16
   CLECs attribute this need to bypass the ILECs to the fact that the ILECs used and continue to use a
variety of mechanisms to restrict or degrade access to the local network. Their proposed list of abuses
includes charging exorbitant prices for unbundling their components (elements), delaying the transfer
(handoff) of loops (wires) from their own switches to those of competitors, using slow and error-prone
manual rather than electronic handoffs, charging high prices to CLECs for renting space in ILEC local
service offices to collect these loops, and simply opting to pay fines rather than obey the law. CLECs claim
that these ILEC practices have succeeded in killing off the lion’s share of their number.
17
  For example, one recent estimate finds that local phone customers that switch to CLEC providers can
save $11.40 per month, or almost $137 a year, in California. See http://www.trac.policy.net/proactive/
newsroom/release.vtml?id=18900. A study released by the Michigan Alliance for Competitive
Telecommunications said consumers in that state saved $72M on local residential phone bills in 2002
because of competition stimulated by reduced UNE-P rates. A similar study in Illinois said consumers
spent $131 million less on local residential phone service as competition heated up. See, Braunstein, Yale
M. “The Role of UNE-P in Vertically Integrated Telephone Networks: Ensuring Healthy and Competitive
Local, Long Distance, and DSL Markets.” University of California, Berkeley, May 2003; Michigan
Alliance for Competitive Telecommunications press release on “study” – May 15, and 2003 “Consumer
Savings from Local Telephone Service Competition in Illinois,” released by Illinois Coalition for
Competitive Telecommunications, February 2003.

already introduced such policies or taken decisions to introduce such policies, in respect

to telecommunications networks.”18

           This evidence notwithstanding, there have been few careful attempts to measure

the effects of unbundling on price and investment. One exception -- Willig, Lehr,

Bigelow, and Levinson (2002) -- gathered detailed data on ILEC investment and

regulatory regimes and found that lower UNE prices are associated with higher ILEC

investment in a statistically significant manner --a pattern consistent with the findings

presented here, including the fact that the investment boom ended when most of the

CLECs exited or were otherwise driven out of the market.



3. The ILEC View

           The ILECs have a much different view of the 1996-2001 telecom boom and bust.

Their explanation of CLEC business failures is that these companies had bad business

plans, over-invested in telecom, and were poorly managed. With respect to their own

investment, the ILECs argue that absent TA96 and TELRIC pricing, they would be

introducing broadband much more rapidly throughout the country.

           This position is set forth in Jorde, Sidak and Teece (2000), Hausman (1997, 1998,

2000, and 20002), Kahn (1998), and Sidak and Spulber (1997). Their framework is given

in equation (1), which equates the expected marginal return from investment to its

marginal cost.

           (1)      λb MRb MPK b + λ g MR g MPK g = c ,




18
     See Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2001), p.4.


                                                    10
where λ b is the probability of the bad state with low demand and λ g is the probability of

the good state with high demand. In MRi MPK i , MRi stands for the marginal revenue

product and MPKi stands for the marginal physical product of capital in state i. The term

c is the user cost of capital. Those who suggest that TA96 has lowered ILEC investment

make two arguments. First, they claim that MRi equals the retail price of telecom output

in state i and that TA96 lowers retail prices, particularly in states of high demand.

Second, they contend that TA96 makes the cost of capital c higher by increasing the risk

of ILEC investment. In both cases the level of capital and, thus, investment that satisfies

the equation is smaller than would otherwise be the case.

       Our principal concern with these studies is that they treat ILECs as ordinary,

price-taking competitive firms, rather than as natural monopolists, that control bottleneck

infrastructure. In taking this approach, the prior studies ignore the elementary textbook

lesson that lowering and fixing the prices that monopolists can charge will induce them to

produce more, not less, output. The reason is that when confronted with a fixed price,

monopolists no longer have an incentive to restrict production in order to jack up prices

and profits. Because producing more output entails acquiring more inputs, this means

hiring more labor and investing in more capital.

       How does this discussion square with equation (1)? It doesn’t. In the case of a

regulated monopoly, equation (1) doesn’t represent the correct framework for

determining investment. Even if it did, under monopoly marginal revenue, MRi, doesn’t




                                            11
equal price, and eliminating monopoly by fixing a lower output price can actually raise

marginal revenue.19

         The third point seemingly missed by the prior studies is that TA96’s leased access

provisions represent an indirect method of regulating the price telecom monopolists can

charge. Instead of simply setting and fixing price, leased access uses competition to do

so. In the course of setting a lower price, leased access expands the market, but also may

transfer some market share to new entrants.                   Total market output and capital must

increase, but depending on the share captured by CLECs, ILEC capital may go up or

down. Leased access also transforms ILECs into wholesale producers with respect to

their transactions with the CLECs. And because much of the final output sold by CLECs

employs wholesale network inputs purchased from the ILECs, the effect of retail market

share loss on ILEC capital investments is likely to be minimal. This point is important in

assessing the unbundling simulations presented below.

         To summarize, TA96 needs to be understood as part of a general strategy of

restraining a natural monopolist from exercising monopoly power.                           The unbundling

requirements of TA96 enforce competitive pricing. While this lowers the prices the

ILECs receive for their products, they are still likely to produce and invest more, either

directly or through their sale of inputs to the CLECs, as they realize that limiting supply



19
   When price is fixed (typically at average cost) via regulation, the monopolist ends up at a corner solution
in which marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue with respect to a marginal increase in output and
marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost with respect to decrease in output. In the case of a monopolist,
MRi does not simply equal the monopoly product price, Pim. Instead, it equals the product Pim (1-1/ε),
where ε is the elasticity of demand. Unregulated monopolists operate in regions of the demand curve in
which ε exceeds 1. Consequently, marginal revenue is below price. When regulators set a regulated lower
price, call it Pi ’, they also transform the demand curve facing the monopolist into a horizontal line, with ε =
                                                                                  ’
∞. This, in turn, changes marginal revenue from the product Pim (1-1/ε) to Pi . Hence, leased access can
raise ILEC marginal revenue even through it lowers the product price.




                                                      12
to increase prices will no longer work. Thus, when one frames the discussion of TA96 as

part of a policy to restrict monopoly power and compares the impact of TA96 with the

price fixing and cutbacks in supply that its absence would foster, the conclusion that

TA96 stimulates overall telecom output and investment seems unavoidable. Moreover,

the proposition, supported by the investment experience reported in Table 1, that it

actually stimulates ILEC production and investment is highly plausible.

       An additional, but crucial point ignored by the literature claiming that TELRIC

pricing is “too low,” is that that the TELRIC formula prices unbundled network access at

its average cost rather than its much lower marginal cost. Pricing at marginal cost is, of

course, more efficient because it equates marginal benefits to marginal costs. In contrast,

TELRIC pricing may leave marginal benefits far above marginal costs. Hence, under

TELRIC pricing access rates may be set too high, rather than too low. Indeed, TELRIC

access rates appear to be far too high since the marginal costs of using many of the

elements of the local network are close to zero.



4. Analyzing Telecom Investment as a Dynamic Game

       The ability of TA96 to restrain the ILECs from monopolizing the provision of

telecom products depends critically on the degree to which the law encourages CLECs to

enter and compete in local telecom markets. In this section we develop an economic

model that accounts for these factors.        Subsequent sections discuss the model’s

calibration to U.S. county data and present our simulation results.

       A serious appraisal of TA96 and its impact on investment, product pricing, and

consumer welfare requires a dynamic model that incorporates multiple telecom products,




                                            13
entry and exit decisions, heterogeneity in local telecom demand, the first-mover

advantage of the ILECs, the ability of multiple competitors to unbundle and use the local

network pipeline, the cost of unbundling, competition from cable companies, the nature

of local telecom competition at any point in time given current entrants, economies of

scope in producing and marketing multiple telecom products in the same geographic

location, and the option values of both waiting to invest and not waiting to invest.20 Each

of these features is included in our analysis. One added feature that we include in our

model but not in the simulations because of computational constraints is economies of

scale in entering geographically adjacent markets.

         Since the model has a number of features, it may help to present it first

informally, the task to which we now turn.



Players, Products, and Location

         The model accommodates a variable number of players, products and local

markets, which we reference as squares on a grid. In the simulation, however, we posit

four players – an ILEC, two CLECs and a Cable— that market two products – local voice

and data – in 3108 local telecom markets – the counties in the continental United States.

In principal, each player decides each period whether to remain in the squares in which

20
   Hausman’s concern about option values affecting telecom investment decisions is certainly appropriate,
but there is no way to evaluate TELRIC pricing without a fully articulated dynamic model in which the
options available to both the ILECs and CLECs are made explicit. Since Hausman fails to present such a
model, he provides no substantiation for his allegation that TELRIC prices are set too low. Furthermore,
the TELRIC formula’s cost of capital takes into account investor considerations of option values. Finally,
many of the points that Hausman makes about CLECs having the option to terminate the purchase of UNE-
P service from ILECs are not particularly special to this market. Regardless of what line of business one
considers and regardless of whether one is talking about retail or wholesale sales, the reality is that retail
telecom customers almost always retain the option of not buying one’s product leaving one with
unrecoverable sunk costs. Hausman’s concerns also seem to pre-date the FCC’s issuance of its Triennial
Review Order in which is makes clear that it does not intend to require ILECs to provide CLECs access to
services and capabilities that may arise from new ILEC investments or technologies.


                                                     14
she has been operating or whether to enter squares in which she hasn’t been operating.

However, in our specific application of the model only the CLECs make entry and exit

decisions.



The Structure of Demand

       Demand differs in each square and can change over time.         Specifically, we

assume that squares can differ in the number of consumers they contain and their average

per capita income. Households in these squares are assumed to have Cobb-Douglas

preferences defined over communication services and other goods and services.

Communication services are, themselves, a composite commodity generated by a Cobb-

Douglas production function, whose inputs are the individual telecommunication

products sold on the market, e.g., voice and data.

       These assumptions greatly simplify the model and the time required for its

computation. With Cobb-Douglas preferences, households spend a fixed share of their

incomes on communication services each period. And, thanks to the Cobb-Douglas

assumption about the production of communication services, households also spend a

fixed share of their income each period on each particular telecom product. This feature

implies three things. First, there is a unitary elasticity of demand for each telecom

product.     Second, it becomes computationally simple to calculate total countywide

demand for each telecom product once the price of the product is determined; all that is

needed is to divide the price of the product by total countywide income. Third, the

demand for one telecom product does not depend on the prices of the other telecom

products.




                                            15
The Structure of Supply

       Telecom firms are assumed to produce their products at constant marginal cost,

but they face two different fixed costs.      One is a fixed cost for entering a square

(geographic market), which must be paid upon initial entry, but need not be paid again as

long as the firm continues to operate in the square. Such fixed entry costs are meant to

capture the costs of installing local infrastructure that is incidental to producing

telecommunications services in the market in question.

       The other fixed cost is a flat operating cost that the firm must pay each period that

it operates (produces and sells product) in the square. One can think of these as the

overhead costs of management, accounting, billing, providing customer support,

advertising, maintaining a fringe benefits program, and the flat costs of renting (either

explicitly or implicitly via direct ownership) necessary network facilities.

       We can model economies of scale by specifying that the fixed entry and operating

costs for a particular square are lower if the player is already operating in an adjacent

square. And we can model economies of scope by assuming that if a player offers more

than one product in a square, her fixed costs of entering the square to offer the second

product and her fixed operating costs with respect to this second product are lower.



The State of Entry

       At the beginning of each period, there is a state of entry that indicates which

players operated in the square in the previous period. The indicator variables identifying

such states of entry represent the model’s state variables. The state space that is relevant

to entry decisions in any given square can get very large in the presence of economies of




                                             16
scale. The reason is that the state of entry in one square can affect entry and exit

decisions in adjacent squares, which, in turn, affect decisions in squares adjacent to the

original adjacent squares, and so on. This implies that the inclusion of scale economies

enlarges the state space relevant to entry and exit in a given square to the state of entry in

all squares. Since the application of our model treats each of the 3108 counties in the

continental United States as a square, incorporating economies of scale would entail

evaluating an enormous set of strategies over an enormous set of state variables –

something far beyond the capacity of conventional computers.



Entry and Exit Decisions

       At the beginning of each period, the players decide whether or not to offer each of

the products in each of the squares. The fixed costs they incur for entering a square and

offering service may differ across products and, as indicated, be subject to economies of

both scale and scope. The fixed operating costs can also be subject to economies of

scope, if more than one product is offered by the same player in a given square. The fact

that incumbents don’t need to pay an entry cost, while new entrants do, captures the

advantage of moving first (being an incumbent). In general, entry costs will differ across

players and are influenced by regulatory policy.

       Players that exit a market are assumed to abandon their infrastructure. Hence, if

they choose at a future date to enter a square, they will need to repay the fixed entry cost.

This feature may lead players to remain in a square in the short run even if they are losing

money on current operations.




                                             17
        Since there are several products per square and many squares, there are many

different “in” or “out” entry strategies over which each player must choose. This choice

is whittled down by solving for the set of pure strategy Nash equilibria, which, in this

setting, refers to the set of strategies in which each player makes an entry decision with

respect to each product and each square that generates the largest expected profits,

measured in present value, given the entry decisions (i.e., the strategy sets) of the other

players. Players consider not just their current profits from entry, but also their future

profits because their future profits can be used to amortize their initial fixed entry costs.




Multiple Equilibria

        In entry games of this type, multiple Nash equilibria are to be expected.

Intuitively, if player A enters a market it may be optimal for player B to stay out. But if

player A stays out, it may be optimal for player B to go in. Which outcome arises can be

thought of as a fluke of timing since there is nothing in our model that pins down which

equilibrium is selected.

        Our method of resolving the problem of multiple Nash equilibria in a given period

is to assume that each of the Nash equilibria is played with the same probability.21 The

players realize that this randomly determined coordination over particular Nash equilibria

will occur not only in the present, but also at every future date. And they take this into

account in determining their best current entry/exit strategy for each of the possible

current entry/exit strategies of their fellow players.


21
  This assumption that a particular equilibrium among the many available is selected is Aumann’s (1974)
correlated equilibrium.


                                                  18
Within-Period Product Competition

           Once entry and exit decisions have been made, the players operating in a given

square play Cournot. Consequently, the more entrants in a given square, the lower are

product prices, and the better off are consumers.22 Another appealing feature of Cournot

within-period equilibria is that producers with lower marginal costs produce more output

than those with higher marginal costs. Finally, the Cournot Model suggests that the

reduction in product prices associated with more competition can lead the ILEC to invest

more and produce more output. While the Cournot model has lots of appealing features,

the list does not include the ability to consider the bundling of products that players

would likely use to achieve a competitive advantage. Such product bundling will be

examined in future work.



Option Valuation

           The model is solved using dynamic programming, which automatically captures

all the options available to the players with respect either to delaying or accelerating their

entry/investment decisions.23 Consequently, it deals explicitly with the concerns raised

by Hausman (1998, 2002) that TA96’s effects must be evaluated with respect to possible

ILEC options to wait to invest. Although our model does not include exogenous pricing

uncertainty, future prices are uncertain because of the correlation on randomly selected

equilibria. Hence, there can be a value to waiting in order to ascertain whether other

firms choose to enter a square.



22
     This assumes that new entrants do not have higher marginal costs, on average, than incumbents.
23
  If the last period is set sufficiently far into the future, its choice will not affect the model’s predicted
current behavior.


                                                      19
The Formal Model

       Time runs from t=1 to t=T. There are Z players, V network inputs, and F= H × M

squares, where H is the number of north-south squares and M is the number of east-west

squares. For each product and for each player, there are N=2F possible states of entry at

the beginning of any period, where a state of entry is a description of all the squares in

which a player was operating in the previous period.



Entry Space

       The possible states of entry of player i with respect to product k at the beginning

of any time t are given by the N rows of the N × F matrix E, with row vector ei. A value

of 0 indicates entry has not yet occurred. A value of 1 indicates entry has occurred. Note

that there are F elements in each row vector – one for each square.

(1)
       e1   = (0,0,0,0,…,0)
       e2   = (1,0,0,0, …,0)
       e3   = (0,1,0,0,…,0)
       e4   = (1,1,0,0,…,0)
       e5   = (0,0,1,0,…,0)
       e6   = (1,0,1,0, …,0)
       e7   = (0,1,1,0, …,0)
       e8   = (1,1,1,0, …,0)
       .            .
       .            .
       .            .
       eN   = (1,1,1, …,1)


The State of Entry

       Let mikt denote the entry state of player i with respect to product k at the beginning

of time t. The value of mikt is a number ranging from 1 through N indicating which of the




                                            20
N row vectors of E is applicable. The entry state of all players at the beginning of time t

is given by the Z × V matrix At, whose row vectors (one for each player) are given below.

(2)     a1t = (m11t , m12t, …, m1Vt)

        a2t = (m21t , m22t, …, m2Vt)
        .              .
        .              .
        .              .
        aZt = (mZ1t , mZ2t, …, mZVt)

Each element in At can take on N different values. Hence, there are NZV different possible

states of nature (At matrices) at time t.

Strategies

        In each period, each player can play any of the rows of E; i.e., players can stay

where they are in terms of entry, chose to leave squares they entered in the past, or

choose to enter squares in which they were not operating in the previous period. There

are G = NV different strategies for each player, because there are V products and N

possible entry vectors for each product. Index these strategies by g, where g = 1,…,G.

Let sg(i)t refers to strategy g undertaken by player i at time t, where strategy vector sg(i)t =

(jg(i)1t , jg(i)2t , …,jg(i)Vt ), for g(i)= 1,…,G. This vector indicates the entry decisions made

by player i at time t for each product given that player i is playing strategy g(i). For

example, suppose there are three products (V = 3) and consider sg(i)t = (4,7,2). This

strategy entails player i entering the market for product 1 in all the squares determined by

the row vector e4, entering the market for product 2 in all the squares determined by the

row vector e7, and entering the market for product 3 in all the squares determined by the

row vector e2.




                                               21
Determination of Entry at Time T

        Entry decisions at time T need to be made for each possible state of the entry

matrix AT. For each such possible state we calculate all pure strategy equilibria at time T.

We then assume that each of these equilibria arises at time T with equal probability; i.e.,

that there is a random correlation mechanism that chooses the equilibrium.



Calculating Pure Strategy Equilibria at Time T

        Let πit (sg(1)1t, sg(2)2t,…, sg(Z)Zt; At ) for g(1) = 1,…,G; g(2) = 1,…,G; …; g(Z) =

1,…,G; specify the net income earned by firm i in period t given the state of entry is At

from playing strategy sgit given that player 1 plays sg(1)1t, player 2 plays sg(2)2t, etc. For

(sg(1)1T, sg(2)2T,…, sg(i)iT, …, sg(Z)ZT; AT ) to be a pure strategy at T, it must be the case that,

(3)
        π1T (sg(1)T, sg(2)T,…, sg(Z)T; AT ) ≥ π1T (sjT, sg(2)T,…, sg(Z)T; AT ), for all j ≠ g(1).

        π2T (sg(1)T, sg(2)T,…, sg(Z)T; AT ) ≥ π2T (sg(1)T, sjT,…, sg(Z)T; AT ), for all j ≠ g(2).

                 .                                           .
                 .                                           .
                 .                                           .
        πZT (sg(1)T, sg(2)T,…, sg(Z)T; AT ) ≥ πZT (sg(1)T, sg(2)T,…, sjT; AT ), for all j ≠ g(Z).



Determination of Entry at t<T

        Entry decisions at time t need to be made for each possible state-of-entry matrix

At. For each possible state-of-entry matrix we calculate all the economy’s pure strategy

equilibria at time t. As in the case of entry at time T, we assume that each of the time t<T

equilibria arise with equal probability.




                                                   22
Calculating Pure Strategy Equilibria at Time t

        Let Nt(At) equal the number of pure strategy equilibria at time t given that the

entry state at time t is At. Let nt = 1,…,Nt(At) reference these equilibria. Define Vit(At) as

the expected present value of net income earned by firm i calculated at the beginning of

time t given the entry state at time t is At.


                       N t ( At )
                                    π it (n; At ) + δVit +1 ( At +1 (nt ))
(4)     Vit ( At ) =    ∑
                        nt =1                     N t ( At )
                                                                             ,


where ViT+1(AT+1) = 0. The term δ is the discount factor. The index nt, which references

the pure strategy equilibrium played at time t, determines the entry state that will prevail

at time t+1. Hence, At+1 is written as a function of nt. For (sg(1)t, sg(2)t,…, sg(i)t, …, sg(Z)t;

At ) to be a pure strategy at t, it must satisfy

(5)
        π1t (sg(1)t, sg(2)t,…, sg(Z)t; At )+ δV1t+1(At+1(sg(1)1t, sg(2)2t,…, sg(Z)Zt)) ≥

        π1t (sjt, sg(2)t,…, sg(Z)t; At ) + δV1t+1(At+1(sjt, sg(2)t,…, sg(Z)t)),   for all j ≠ g(2).

The equations defining pure strategy equilibria are the same as those for time T except

that the players consider not simply current net revenue from playing a particular

strategy, but also the expected present value of future revenue associated with entering




                                                                   23
the next period from the entry state to which their own strategic entry decisions as well as

those of their competitors lead.



The Structure of Demand and Supply
       Assume the utility of agents is Cobb-Douglas in communications, c, and other

goods, d, where

(7)              U(c,d) = cα h(1-α)

Each agent’s demand for communications is given by c = αy/pc, where y stands for

income and pc stands for the price of communications. Each agent produces

communications based on a Cobb-Douglas production function that takes as inputs the V

communications products that include local telephone and data. Each agent’s production

function is given by

                                                                       j=V

Cost minimization implies that input expenditure shares equal their production

coefficients.

(9)              piqi = βi E

The constant returns property means that total costs equal total expenditures. Hence,

(10)            pcc = E ,

where pi is the price (user cost) of input i. And since pcc = αy, we have


(11)            piqi =βiαy

or

(12)             qi =βiαy/pi

The aggregate demand for telecom input i in the telecom market in question, Qi , is then,

(13)            Qi =βiαY/pi ,

where Y is aggregate income in the local telecom market.



The Cournot Game

A player j producing telecom input i playing Cournot will set

(14)           ηθji =(pi – mcji)/pi ,

where η is the inverse demand elasticity in the market for the input, θji is the output share

of player j in the production of good i, and mcji is the marginal cost of player j in

producing input i. In this model, η = 1. Summing the above equation over all players j,

we have that

                     vi
(15)           pi = Σ mcij / (vi – 1),
                  j=1

where vi is the number of players in the market.



Summarizing and Evaluating the Solution

       This solution is simple. In each square for each configuration of entrants being

considered, we simply add up the marginal costs of the players, divide by one less than

their number, and that’s the price that will prevail. The formula, Qi =βiαY/pi can be used

to determine Qi, and each entrant j’s output can be determined by multiplying qj=θjQi,

where θj=(pi – mcji)/pi. Player j’s profit for operating in the square for the period in

question is given by piqj –fecj – focj – mcjqj, where fecj refers to the fixed cost of entry for




                                              25
player j if she hasn’t already entered the market and focj stands for player j’s fixed

operating cost.

       A shortcoming of this method of modeling demand is that the solution is not well

defined in the case of a monopolist because the demand elasticity for each telecom input

equals unity. We assume that when there is a single player supplying an input in a given

market, the player is forced by regulators to price at levels that roughly match current

actual circumstances.

       The model’s solution has the property that a player’s profits in producing one

telecom input don’t depend on the amount of the other telecom inputs she supplies in the

market (square). The reason is that the demand curve for input i depends only on its own

price and not on the prices of the other inputs. Were this not the case, a Cournot player in

a square supplying more than one input would have to consider how her supply of one

input altered the price and thus demand for the other input(s) she supplies.


5. Calibration

       To focus the model on the current policy debate, we assume that in each county

there are two markets, local voice and data, and that the ILEC offers both of these

services in each county in the initial period. We also assume that cable companies have

entered some, but not all counties, to offer CATV service – and if they are offering

CATV service in a county, they also offer data in that county. Because of franchise

limitations, cable companies are assumed never to enter additional counties, nor to exit

counties. Our procedure for specifying which counties are served by cable companies is

to use FCC statistics that report the percentage of zip codes in each state having particular




                                             26
numbers of broadband providers.24 We assume these statewide percentages of zip codes

apply similarly to the counties in a state and thus infer the percentage of counties in each

state having two or more broadband providers. This percentage is then assumed to be the

percentage of counties served by a cable provider. Next, we rank the counties in each

state by population density and, starting with the county with the highest density, we

work down the ranking until we have selected enough counties to account for the

specified percentage of counties with a cable provider. Thus, for Alaska, the FCC report

indicates that 22 percent of the Alaska’s zip codes have two or more broadband

providers. We then assume that the 22 percent of Alaska's counties with the highest

population density have a cable provider.

        In addition to the ILEC and cable company providers of voice or data services in

a square, we assume that there are two identical CLECs, which decide individually

whether to enter one or both of these product markets in each particular square.

        When the ILEC is the sole provider of voice in a particular county, we assume, to

repeat, that the price for voice is set via regulation. We refer to this regulated price as the

regulated monopoly price. The same assumption is made with respect to the price of data

in counties in which the ILEC is the sole provider of data. However, if one or more

competitors enter a county in either voice or data or both, we assume that prices are set

according to Cournot competition.

        Interestingly, there is no guarantee that Cournot competition will generate lower

prices than those currently set by regulators. The prices that emerge in a county with one

or more competitors will depend on the precise number of competitors and their marginal

                                                27
costs of production. Since the marginal costs facing CLECs depend on the UNE rates set

by state PUCs, PUCs should be aware that if they set their UNE rates too high, they may

be leaving consumers facing higher telecom prices under “competition” than under

regulated monopoly. This, in fact, is what we find in a minority of counties in states with

particularly high UNE rates.

        We assume that preferences of residential consumers for communication services

are identical across all counties. However, total residential consumer demand in each

county will differ based on the county’s number of households and average level of

household income. Our county counts of total households and our county averages of

household      income     come      from     the      2000       U.S.    Census      (available       at

http://www.factfinder.census.gov).

        Households are assumed to spend three percent of their income on

communication services. This percentage accords with findings from the Consumer

Expenditure Survey and is used to identify the model’s Cobb-Douglas preference

parameter. Of the total expenditure on communication services, we assume that 70

percent is spent on local voice and 30 percent is spent on data.25

        Another component of demand for communication services in each county is

business demand, which we assume is inelastic. Hence, in each county we add a fixed

level of expenditure by businesses on voice and data services to the respective household

demands for those services. We determine these fixed expenditures in the following

manner. The PACE Report details total business lines per state,26 and a 2002 Commerce

Capital Markets report provides estimates of business revenues per line per ILEC

provider.27 We multiply each state’s total business lines by the state’s ILEC’s business

revenue per line to arrive at our estimate of total voice business expenditures by state.

We allocate this overall state expenditure across the counties in the state based on the

cross-county distribution of total state employment, where our county employment data

are taken from the 2000 U.S. Census.28

           We follow the same county-allocation procedure with respect to our estimate of

total business spending on broadband in each state. This estimate is determined by

multiplying our estimate of each state’s total business voice expenditure by the nation-

wide ratio of total business broadband spending to total business voice spending. Our

estimate of total business broadband spending comes from data reported in an ISP-Planet

article posted at http://www.isp-planet.com/research/2002/cable_020524.html.                       This

article indicates that small businesses are spending about $2.3 billion in 2002 on

broadband and that they account for 34 percent of the total business broadband market.

Dividing $2.3 billion by .34 gives $6.8 billion, which is our estimate of total business

broadband spending in 2002. Our measure of total business voice spending is determined

by simply adding together our state estimates of business voice spending.

Incorporating Current Policy

       To accommodate current policy, we expanded our model to allow CLECs to

decide each period whether or not to operate in a county under UNEs. Recall that to offer

voice, CLECs purchase a platform of local network elements from ILECs at wholesale

rates and add to it their own marketing and customer support to create retail voice

services to sell to the public. This does not require CLECs to collocate in ILEC central

offices in order to access physically the local phone line (loop).   Such collocation and

physical connection to the customer’s loop is, however, required for the CLEC to be able

to offer broadband.

       When a CLEC decides to offer data, it has the option of offering voice as well.

Because CLECs are more than willing to provide both data and voice services over the

loops they access from the ILEC, we assume that when offering data, CLECs need pay

only a single entry fee and a single fixed annual operating fee to enter a county and be

able to provide both voice and data; i.e., we assume strong economies of scope in

providing both products. The result is that CLECs that enter a local market to offer data

also choose to provide voice. But given the prohibitive operational and cost impediments

enumerated above in backhauling voice signals from a collocation into the CLEC’s own

network, we assume, realistically, that such CLECs return the voice signal to the ILEC

switch from this collocation point and offer voice under UNE-P. As discussed in the

calibration section, we add an additional marginal cost to account for data-providing

CLECs’ extra costs to offering voice.




                                            30
        All players (ILEC and CLECs) must cover their fixed operating costs in each

period they are present in a square -- regardless of whether they are offering just voice, or

voice and data.


Additional Parameters

        We assume that the regulated monopoly price for voice in each state is set at the

average residential revenue per line per state, which, across all states, averages roughly

$29.29 We set the regulated monopoly price for data at $50 based on our sense of the

average broadband price that would prevail around the country in the absence of any

competition. We set the ILEC’s marginal cost of providing voice at $5. Note that this is

the ILEC’s short-run marginal network costs for providing an extra voice line of service.

We treat the ILEC’s ongoing marketing, customer support, and sales costs in a given

county as fixed operating costs that total $50 per household times the number of

households in the county.

        Our source for each state’s actual UNE-P rates is the above-referenced 2002 Ex

Parte submission. Our source for state-specific TELRIC UNE-P rates are the TELRIC

rates calculated from the UNE version of the FCC’s 1998 Synthesis Model, with a 5

percent annual adjustment to reflect intervening reductions in input prices and unit costs.

        State-specific actual and TELRIC UNE-P rates are reported in Table 2. Consider

first current UNE-P rates, and note the wide range in values, from a low of $12.42 in

Indiana to a high of $45.64 in West Virginia. About three-fifths of the states are setting

    See Ex Parte submission from Joan Marsh, AT&T, to Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 01-338,

in the country.


                                                   31
UNE-P rates from $18 to $25. Only 7 states have UNE-P rates that are reasonably close

to the national weighted average TELRIC rate of $15.10.

       Next consider the true TELRIC UNE-P rates. These range in value from a low of

$9.45 in Washington, D.C. to a high of $27.39 in Missouri. Thirty-eight states, including

the District of Columbia, have true TELRIC rates below $18. In only 5 states do

TELRIC rates exceed $22. While TELRIC UNE-P prices are, on average, 27.9 percent

lower than current UNE prices, five states – Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, and

Vermont have set current UNE-P rates below the TELRIC levels, with the difference

reaching as high as $1.74 in Indiana. On the other hand, current UNE-P prices exceed

their corresponding TELRIC levels by $6 or more in 34 states, including Washington,

D.C. The largest differential -- $21.75 -- arises in the case of West Virginia, where the

current UNE –P rate is $45.64 even though the true TELRIC UNE-P rate is only $23.89.

       CLECs that provide voice-only services using UNEs are assumed to face a

marginal cost equal to the UNE-P (whether actual or TELRIC) rate plus $5 to cover

customer support costs. Such CLECs incur no fixed entry cost, but do need to pay fixed

operating costs on an ongoing basis for marketing, sales, and customer support, which we

also take as $50 per household times the number of households. CLECs that operate in a

given county (square) to provide data and voice are assumed to face a marginal cost for

offering voice equal to the prevailing UNE-P rate plus $5 for customer support costs plus

$5 for additional costs of interfacing with the ILECs to hand back the voice portion of the

signal. The marginal cost of providing data is set at $20 for both the local ILEC and

cable companies and at $25 for CLECs, where the difference reflects the higher CLEC

costs for acquiring and transporting the data signal to their network.




                                             32
          The fixed cost faced by a CLEC to enter a county and operate under UNE-L is set

at $75 times the number of households in the county. And the CLEC’s fixed operating

cost each year under UNE-P is, again, set at $50 times the number of households in the

county. Note that CLECs that enter under UNE-L and UNE-P to market both voice and

data incur only a single fixed entry cost and need pay only a single annual fixed operating

cost.

          The final parameter we need to discuss is the choice of discount rate applicable to

CLEC decision-making.         We use an 11 percent real discount rate.         This seems, if

anything, to be on the low side, given the considerable risks of new carriers entering and

competing in the telecom market with its ever-changing policies and policymakers. Were

we to use a higher discount rate, our model would likely generate less data entry than we

report. The reason is that for CLECs to enter providing data, they need to recoup their

fixed entry costs. But the higher the discount rate, the smaller will be the present value of

the future profits from entry that need to be set against the immediate cost of entry.



6. Findings

          We now present two sets of findings, one from running the model based on the

actually prevailing UNE rates and the other based on running the model assuming each

state adopts completely TELRIC UNE rates. To limit the paper’s length, we show only

aggregate results in most tables. However, we discuss some of the state-specific results

in      the   text.    The    state-specific   results   for   all   tables   are   posted   at

http://econ.bu.edu/kotlikoff.




                                               33
The Effect of UNE-P Rates on Voice and Data Prices

         Table 3 shows the impact on voice and data prices of introducing UNE-P

competition under both actual and TELRIC rates. The top set of results is for the entire

country. The next set of results divides counties into four groups based on whether their

levels of per capita income are higher or lower than average, and whether their

population density is higher or lower than average. HYHD stands for high income, high

density. HYLD stands for high income, low density. LYHD stands for low income, high

density. And LYLD stands for low income, low density.



Average Voice Prices Across the Country30

         Table 3’s results compare our measure of the regulated monopoly price with the

prices that prevail under the two UNE pricing regimes. Each of the regulated monopoly

prices reported in the table represents a household weighted average of the counties

included in average. Our association of regulated monopoly prices for voice with the

average state voice prices that prevailed in 2000 is admittedly arbitrary since these

figures come from a period marked by some, albeit very limited, competition. In any

case, these state averages range from $28 to $31 per line per month, with the national

average voice price equaling $28.93. In the case of data, we’ve assumed, to repeat, a

regulated monopoly price of $50 per month per broadband connection. Since the model’s

terminal date of year 20 is set to limit computation time and is, in that sense, arbitrary, we

focus here on prices and entry that arise in the initial year following the introduction of

either actual or TELRIC UNE-P rates.

30
  All of the calculated figures in this paper should be only taken as suggestive of the model’s results based
on a uniform nationwide parameterization. We have not attempted to capture all of the influences
surrounding these competitive interactions.


                                                     34
        First consider UNE-P competition based on the actual UNE rates now being set

by state PUCs. According to our model, this policy actually raises the nationwide

average voice price by $1.68 relative to the regulated monopoly price.31 This reflects the

point we made above that if UNE rates are set too high, they will deliver prices that are

higher than those arising under regulated monopoly.

        Next consider the impact of switching from current to TELRIC UNE-P rates.

This lowers the nation’s average voice price by 15.5 percent from $30.61 to $25.86.

Note that the average voice price is now lower than the regulated monopoly price, by

10.6 percent.

        Table 3’s next set of results, which break out prices based on county income and

density, show that counties of all income and density levels stand to gain from switching

from current to TELRIC UNE pricing. The largest gains arise in counties with the

highest densities and highest levels of per capital income. In counties with high per

capita income and high density, the potential gain is 22.6 percent. For counties with low

density and low income per capita, the potential gain is 8.7 percent.



Voice Prices in Individual States

        Under current UNE rates, voice prices range from a low of $23.09 in Illinois to a

high of $42.21 in South Dakota. These differences partly reflect the relative sizes of the

markets in the particular counties in the two states, but they are primarily the


31
   Recall that this assumes no retail rate regulation. The model’s predicted increase over time in the
average voice price reflects the 20-year length of the model. As this terminal date for competition and
entry approaches, CLECs become more willing to enter both voice and data as opposed to just voice
because they know that in the future there will be less entry given that competitors will have less time to
recoup their fixed entry costs. As indicated above, the marginal costs that CLECs face for voice given that
they are offering data are assumed to be $5 higher than under just voice, which explains the higher
equilibrium prices generated in the Cournot quantity setting game.


                                                    35
consequence of the UNE rates set by those states. As indicated in table 2, the Illinois

current UNE rate is $12.69, while South Dakota’s is $34.82.              Only three states --

California, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan – have voice prices that fall below $25 per line

when current UNE rates are run through the model.32 At the other extreme, three states --

Idaho, South Dakota, and Wyoming – have current UNE prices above $38. By way of

comparison, voice prices under a TELRIC UNE rate regime range between $21.52 in

Illinois and $36.78 in Wyoming.

        According to the model, some states would experience particularly large voice

price reductions in moving from current to TELRIC UNE rates. In Massachusetts, for

example, the price reduction is 39.9 percent. In South Dakota, the reduction is 25.9

percent. And in the state of Washington, it’s 27.8 percent.



Data Prices

        Turning to data prices, note that regardless of whether UNE-P is priced at actual

or TELRIC rates, there is sufficient CLEC entry to substantially lower broadband prices.

In the case of current UNE pricing, the resulting data price is $37.41, which is 25.2

percent below the regulated monopoly price. In the case of TELRIC UNE-P pricing, the

data price is slightly higher -- $38.56, but this is still 22.9 percent below the regulated

monopoly price. In contrast to UNE voice pricing, there are much larger differences in

data pricing across regions that are distinguished by per capita income and density.

        Interestingly, low density-low income counties experience particularly low data

prices under TELRIC UNE rates -- $37.85 per month compared with $39.43 per month in


32
  The Indiana PUC has recently raised its UNE rates significantly. See
http://www.in.gov/iurc/press/2004/42393_010504.pdf


                                                   36
the high density-high income counties. The explanation here appears to lie in the fact

that cable companies aren’t competing in the low-density counties. Consequently, there

is sufficient profit opportunity for two CLECs to enter a number of such counties, which

lowers the data price by a greater percentage.

       There is a significant spread across states in data prices. For example, under the

policy of current UNE rates, data prices range from $33.04 in Kansas to $41.85 in West

Virginia.



Consumer and Business Voice Savings from Implementing TELRIC UNE-P Rates

       Table 4 shows for each state and all states combined the annual local voice

savings accruing to consumers and businesses associated with switching from current to

TELRIC UNE rates. The table assumes that states with UNE rates below our TELRIC

proxy will not adjust upward their UNE rates.

       Totaled across all the states, the annual savings is just shy of $15 billion. That’s a

lot of money. Indeed, it exceeds the gross domestic product of most countries. Those

states whose UNE rates are the farthest from TELRIC levels and have the largest markets

obviously have the most to gain from lowering their rates. Texas, New York, and

Massachusetts stand to gain $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. But

smaller, less populated, and less wealthy states, like Oklahoma, also could do very well

by changing their UNE pricing policy. Oklahoma’s potential gain is $129 million.




                                            37
The Nature of Entry

         Table 5 examines the structure of competition in the voice market and, thus, the

entry that arises, under actual and TELRIC UNE-P regimes.33                            The results clearly

indicate that there is significantly more entry and competition under TELRIC pricing. In

the case of current UNE rates, 36.2 percent of households end up where they started –

living in counties with no competition and being forced to purchase voice services from

the ILEC.       The introduction of TELRIC pricing cuts the percentage of households

without choice almost in half. Now, only 19.3 percent of households live in non-

competitive counties. Furthermore, in the actual UNE rate regime, only 11.6 percent of

households live in counties that experience entry by two CLECs, whereas this figure rises

to 17.6 percent when TELRIC rates are substituted.

         As one would expect, entry and competition is most pronounced in the high

income/high-density counties.             In the case of TELRIC pricing, 99.0 percent of all

households in such counties experience entry by at least one CLEC, and 29.1 percent

experience entry by two CLECs.34

         On the other hand, because the rich, dense markets already enjoy some

competition under current UNE-P rates, movement to TELRIC pricing is relatively more

important for low-income, low-density counties in generating competition.                              Indeed,


33
  There are a couple of counties in which ILECs stop providing service in the short run. That’s why the
row percentages in Table 4 may not always sum to 100 percent.
34
   The dynamics of entry shown in Table 5 are also quite interesting. There is much more entry in the
medium and long runs than in the short run. This additional entry occurs lonly when the CLEC offers data
in addition to voice. The reason is that the CLECs realize that early entry, while it offers a longer period to
recoup the fixed cost of entering for data, is also riskier because the likelihood that competitors will enter in
the future is higher. This likelihood of future entry declines the closer the players get to the model’s 20-
year end date as potential competitors realize that there is too little time to recoup their investments. Stated
differently, the barrier to entry represented by the fixed entry cost is a greater obstacle to entry when this
cost much be amortized over only a few years.




                                                       38
TELRIC pricing raises the fraction of households in such counties that can enjoy the

fruits of competition from 44.3 percent to 62.2 percent.

         For individual states, the structure of competition can differ dramatically,

particularly with current UNE rates.      At one extreme is Arizona in which there is

essentially no entry under current UNE rates.35 At the other extreme are California,

Michigan, and Washington D.C., in which essentially all households experience

competition. With TELRIC UNE pricing, the share of Arizona residents that enjoy a

choice in providers rises from less than 1 percent to 83.6 percent.

         Table 6 provides further information about the nature of entry. It shows the type

of CLEC entry under both current and TELRIC UNE-P rates. In the table “Voice Only”

stands for only one CLEC entering under for voice. “Combined” stands for one CLEC

entering for both voice and data. “Combined/Voice” stands for two CLECs, one of

which enters for both voice and data and the other of which enters just for voice.

“Voice/Voice” stands for two CLECs, both of which enter just for voice.

“Combined/Combined” stands for two CLECs, both of which enter for both voice and

data. And “No CLECs” refers to counties with no CLEC entry.

         The table shows that pricing UNEs at TELRIC rather than actual rates increases

overall CLEC entry, particularly for voice. With TELRIC UNE pricing, over two-fifths

of households live in counties with one CLEC that offers voice. But almost one half of

households live in counties in which one or more CLECs offer both voice and data.

Interestingly, the model generates no cases in which two CLECs enter just to provide

voice.


35
  Since this paper was developed, the Arizona PUC has reduced its UNE rates, and entry may be
occurring.


                                             39
        The table also indicates more entry by CLECs into data markets in low-density-

low-income counties due to the absence of competition from cable companies. This

explains why the move to TELRIC pricing ends up lowering data prices by more in low-

density-low-income counties than in high-density-high-income ones.



CLEC Shares in Voice and Data Markets

        Tables 7 and 8 show the CLEC shares of the voice and data markets, respectively.

According to the model, with current UNE rates, CLECs have 10.7 percent of the voice

market and 13.1 percent of the data market. The respective voice and data market shares

reported by the FCC in mid 2003 are 14.7 percent and 6.6 percent.36 So our model, while

in the same ballpark with respect to the actual and predicted levels of these shares, does

not fit the data perfectly.

        According to the model, the move to true TELRIC pricing raises our model’s

CLEC voice market share from 10.7 percent to 16.5 percent. On the other hand, it lowers

the CLEC data market share from 13.1 percent to 12.1 percent. The CLEC voice share

depends significantly on the type of county being considered. In the case of high-income

- high-density counties, the model predicts a 14.8 percent CLEC share with current UNE-

P rates and a 21.6 percent share with TELRIC UNE-P rates. For low-income – low

density counties, the CLEC voice share is 6.7 percent under current UNE-P rates and

13.2 percent under TELRIC rates.            Hence, in low-income – low-density counties

competition is relatively more sensitive to the level of UNE-P rates.

The Distribution of Price Changes Across Households

       Table 9 shows the share of households experiencing particular voice-price

changes relative to the regulated monopoly price under the current UNE-P regime. In the

current UNE-P regime, almost two fifths of households end up facing a higher voice

price than the regulated monopoly price. Indeed, over a quarter of the households

experience price increases in excess of 20 percent. For the roughly three fifths of

households who see their prices fall, the declines are generally modest. Fewer than 6

percent of all households experience voice price reductions greater than 20 percent.

These nation-wide results mask, however, major differences across states in the treatment

of households. In some states, like Louisiana, all households experience price hikes,

while in other states, like Illinois, all households experience price cuts.

       As Table 10 shows, this heterogeneity is much less pronounced in the case of

TELRIC UNE-P rates. In this case, almost all households experience price reductions in

voice relative to the regulated monopoly price. To be precise, more than a quarter of

households experience price reductions in excess of 20 percent, and almost three fifths of

households enjoy voice price cuts of 10 percent or more. As in the case of current UNE-

P rates, households in different states have quite different experiences. In New York,

almost four-fifths of households enjoy a 30 to 40 percent reduction in voice prices,

whereas in Arkansas almost two thirds of households experience a modest price increase

compared to the regulated monopoly price.

       Table 11 shows the distribution of price changes from implementing TELRIC

rather than current UNE-P rates. Almost two-fifths of households see their voice bills

fall by at least 20 percent, and over one fifth experience a 30 percent or greater reduction




                                              41
in these bills. In certain states, the price reductions are really big. In Massachusetts and

Maryland, for example, over three-fifths of households experience voice price reductions

ranging from 40 to 50 percent.



Changes in Investment and Hiring Outlays

       Our next two Tables, 12 and 13, consider how the two UNE pricing regimes

affect outlays on investment and new hiring over 1, 5, and 20 years relative to the level of

these cost outlays that would have occurred with no competition (no CLEC entry). The

results are again displayed on a household-weighted basis. Outlays refer here to all cost

expenditures, whether these expenditures are entry costs, operating costs, or marginal

costs. These outlays will finance either new investment or the purchase of additional

labor services. In the case of 5-year and 20-year cost outlays, total outlays over those

periods are measured in present value.

       According to table 12, most households – about two thirds of the total -- live in

counties that experience increased spending on investment and new hiring in response to

CLEC voice entry based on current UNE prices.             For example, 29.2 percent of

households live in counties that enjoy a 30 percent or greater hike in telecom cost outlays

in the first year after current UNE rates are introduced. Going out 20 years, 17.1 percent

of households live in such counties.

       While the table indicates a positive outlay response in those counties containing

most of the nation’s households, some counties experience a reduction in outlays from

the introduction of UNE-based voice competition. The reason is that the price increases

that arise in certain high UNE rate counties lead to cut backs in ILEC cost outlays that




                                            42
more than offset the increase in CLEC outlays.     These results, should, again be taken

with a grain of salt since they may simply reflect our overstatement of true TELRIC rates

in the states in question.

        Table 13 shows that with TELRIC UNE rates, there is also much more telecom

investment and hiring expenditures than with no competition. There is also somewhat

more of such expenditures than arises under current UNE rates.           In particularly,

substantially fewer counties experience reductions in telecom investment and hiring

outlays. Table 14 presents the absolute present value dollar outlays on investment and

hiring occurring over specified numbers of years under the regulated monopoly structure

and under policies of actual and TELRIC UNE rates. The table shows that TELRIC rates

promote the greatest investment and hiring. Over a 20 years period, the present value of

investment is almost one quarter higher than with the ILECs having exclusive control of

the market. This 20-year outlay total is almost 5 percent higher with TELRIC UNE rates

than with actual UNE rates. The absolute numbers are also important. According to the

table, over a five-year period, the emergence of competition should mean $71 billion

more telecom investment than under the monopoly structure that prevailed prior to the

Telecom Act of 1996. Over 20 years, competition should add $155 billion to aggregate

investment.



Conclusion

        Our conclusions number five.     First, there is strong empirical evidence that

telecom competition promotes telecom investment. Second, there are solid theoretical

arguments to explain that outcome. Third, the policy debate on telecom investment and




                                           43
regulation has been framed within a static model that fails to capture the dynamic and

highly uncertain entry, pricing, and investment game being played by the ILECs, CLECs,

and cable companies. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the relevance of many prior

telecom studies to the actual telecom market. Fourth, a model rich enough to capture the

complexities of the telecom industry must a) be solved on the computer and b) carefully

calibrated if it is to provide real insight into the policies and other factors affecting that

critical market. We view this paper as a first step in that direction. Fifth, our model

indicates that were UNE rates set at their proper TELRIC level throughout the country,

telecom entry, investment and employment outlays, and output would increase

significantly and local voice prices would fall dramatically. To be precise, telecom

investment and employment outlays would increase by over one fifth in counties

containing the majority of the U.S. population and by over one third in counties

containing almost one third of the population.
