                                           ABSTRACT

Researchers in a variety of important economic literatures have assumed that current income

variables as proxies for lifetime income variables follow the textbook errors-in-variables model. In

an analysis of Social Security records containing nearly career-long earnings histories for the Health

and Retirement Study sample, we find that the relationship between current and lifetime earnings

departs substantially from the textbook model in ways that vary systematically over the life cycle.

Our results can enable more appropriate analysis of and correction for errors-in-variables bias in a

wide range of research that uses current earnings to proxy for lifetime earnings.

  Life-Cycle Variation in the Association between Current and Lifetime Earnings


                                       I. Introduction

       In the year 2003 alone, the American Economic Review’s refereed issues

contained 14 articles reporting regression analyses involving individual or family income

variables, and the May Proceedings issue contained almost that many again. In some

cases, the income variables were dependent variables; in others, they were regressors

used to explain dependent variables ranging from child health in the United States to

borrowing and lending behavior in Ghana. Without exception, the measured income

variables were short-term values even though, in most cases, it appeared that the relevant

economic construct was a longer-term value.

       Many influential economic studies have recognized that the use of current income

as a proxy for long-run income can generate important errors-in-variables biases.

Perhaps the most famous examples are the seminal studies by Modigliani and Brumberg

(1954) and Friedman (1957), which analyzed the properties of consumption functions

estimated with current rather than permanent income variables as the regressors. Another

instance is the literature (e.g., Lillard, 1977) suggesting that inequality as measured in

cross-sections of annual earnings overstates the inequality in lifetime earnings. A recent

offshoot of that literature – exemplified by Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), Haider (2001),

and Baker and Solon (2003) – has attempted to partition the upward trend in earnings

inequality into persistent and transitory components. Still another recent example is the

burgeoning literature on intergenerational income mobility (surveyed in Solon, 1999),

which has found that the association between parents’ and children’s long-run income is
susceptible to dramatic underestimation when current income variables are used as

proxies for long-run income.

           Nevertheless, applied researchers often ignore the distinction between current and

long-run income. Most researchers who do attend to the issue assume the textbook

errors-in-variables model and impute the noise-to-signal ratio by estimating restrictive

models of income dynamics on the basis of short panels of income data spanning only a

segment of the life cycle.1 In this paper, we reconsider the appropriateness of the

textbook errors-in-variables model, and we find that it does not accurately characterize

current earnings as a proxy for lifetime earnings. Thanks to a remarkable new data set,

we are able to generate detailed evidence on the association between current and lifetime

earnings, including its evolution over the life cycle, without having to resort to an

arbitrary specification of the earnings dynamics process.

           Our empirical analysis uses the 1951-1991 Social Security earnings histories of

the members of the Health and Retirement Study sample. Despite some limitations

discussed in section III, these data provide nearly career-long earnings histories, which

are based on relatively accurate administrative data and pertain to a broadly

representative national sample. In section II, we develop simple models to illustrate

some important aspects of the association between current and lifetime earnings and to

demonstrate the implications for errors-in-variables biases in applied econometric

research. In section III, we describe the data set and our econometric methods. In

section IV, we present our evidence on the connections between annual and lifetime

earnings. Section V summarizes our findings and illustrates their usefulness with a brief

application to intergenerational earnings mobility.

                                          II. Models

          Following Friedman (1957), most analyses of current income variables as proxies

for unobserved lifetime income variables have adopted the textbook errors-in-variables

model

(1)       yit = yi + vit

where yit is a current income variable, such as log annual earnings, observed for

individual i in period t ; y i is a long-run income variable, such as the log of the present

discounted value of lifetime earnings; and vit , the measurement error in yit as a proxy for

yi , is assumed to be uncorrelated with y i (and each of its determinants). Often, the

current income variable yit has been adjusted for stage of life cycle with a regression on

a polynomial in age or experience or by subtracting out the cohort mean. Throughout this

section, we will suppress intercepts by expressing all variables as deviations from their

population means.

          The textbook errors-in-variables model in equation (1) is effectively a regression

model that assumes the slope coefficient in the regression of yit on y i equals 1. One

familiar implication of that restriction is that, if yit proxies for y i as the dependent

variable in a linear regression equation, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of that

regression equation consistently estimates the equation’s slope coefficients. Another

well-known implication is that, if yit proxies for y i as the sole explanatory variable in a

simple regression equation, the probability limit of the OLS estimator of the equation’s

slope coefficient equals the true coefficient times an attenuation factor equal to

Var ( yi ) /[Var ( yi ) + Var (vit )] .



                                               3
       These oft-used results no longer apply if the textbook errors-in-variables model

incorrectly characterizes the relationship between current and lifetime income. In part A

of this section, we explain our reasons for suspecting that the slope coefficients in

regressions of current income variables on lifetime variables vary systematically over the

life cycle and do not generally equal 1. In part B, we show how such departures from the

textbook model alter the standard results on errors-in-variables bias.



A. Life-cycle variation

       Several fragments of evidence suggest that the association between current and

lifetime income variables varies over the life cycle. Bjorklund (1993), the closest

predecessor to our study, uses Swedish income tax data from 1951-1989 to conduct a

direct comparison of current and lifetime income. He finds a strong life-cycle pattern in

the correlation between current and lifetime income. In his words, “the correlations are

quite low – and in some cases even negative – up to around 25 years of age and are rather

high after 35 years of age. In general the correlations are around 0.8 after the age of 35.”

Unfortunately, the correlations in income levels reported by Bjorklund do not map

directly into magnitudes of errors-in-variables biases in the sorts of regression estimation

that economists commonly do. In the next subsection, we develop measures of

association between current and lifetime earnings that do have direct implications for

errors-in-variables biases.

       Another indication of life-cycled-related departures from the textbook errors-in-

variables model, noted by Jenkins (1987) and Grawe (forthcoming), involves the

estimation of intergenerational mobility models such as the regression of son’s log




                                              4
lifetime earnings on father’s log lifetime earnings. If son’s log annual earnings as a

proxy for the dependent variable obeyed the textbook errors-in-variables model, the

estimated intergenerational elasticity would have the same probability limit regardless of

the age at which the son’s earnings were observed. On the other hand, if the slope

coefficient in the regression of son’s log annual earnings on son’s log lifetime earnings

deviates from 1 in a way that evolves over the life cycle, then analyses observing sons’

earnings at different ages will yield systematically different elasticity estimates. Solon’s

(1999) survey of the intergenerational mobility literature reveals precisely such a pattern

– the studies that estimate the smallest elasticities tend to be those that observe sons’

earnings early in their careers. Correspondingly, several studies (e.g., Reville, 1995) that

have explicitly investigated the effects of varying the ages at which sons’ earnings are

observed have found that the estimated intergenerational elasticities increase substantially

as the sons’ earnings are observed further into their careers.

       Notwithstanding the strong tradition of assuming that current income variables as

proxies for lifetime income variables follow the textbook errors-in-variables model,

indications that this assumption is false should not be surprising. Any realistic model of

income evolution over the life cycle would contradict the traditional assumption. As an

extremely simple example, suppose that yit , the log real earnings of worker i in year t

of his career, follows

(2)     yit = α i + γ i t

where initial log earnings α i varies across the population with variance σ α2 and the

earnings growth rate γ i varies across the population with variance σ γ2 . Heterogeneity in

earnings growth is a natural consequence of heterogeneity in human capital investment,


                                              5
and its empirical importance has been documented by Mincer (1974), Baker (1997),

Haider (2001), and Baker and Solon (2003) among others. For simplicity, assume zero

covariance between α i and γ i , infinite lifetimes, and a constant real interest rate r > γ i .

Then the present discounted value of lifetime earnings is

                ∞
(3)     Vi =          exp(α i + γ i s )(1 + r ) − s ≅ exp(α i )[(1 + r ) /(r − γ i )] ,
               s =0


and the log of the present value of lifetime earnings is thus

                                           γi
(4)     log Vi ≅ α i + r − log r +              .
                                            r

It follows that the slope coefficient in the regression of current log earnings on the log of

the present value of lifetime earnings is

             Cov(log Vi , y it ) σ α + (tσ γ / r )
                                    2       2

(5)     λt ≡                    ≅ 2                  .
              Var (log Vi )      σ α + (σ γ2 / r 2 )

        The main thing to note about this result is that, contrary to the textbook errors-in-

variables model, λt generally does not equal 1. Instead, it starts at a value less than 1 at

the outset of the career and then increases monotonically over the life cycle. It reaches 1

when t = 1 / r and then exceeds 1 afterwards. The intuition is that the workers with high

lifetime earnings tend to be those with high earnings growth rates. Consequently, when

comparing the current earnings of those with high and low lifetime earnings, an early-

career comparison tends to understate their gap in lifetime earnings, and a late-career

comparison may overstate it. Note that the common practice of adjusting current

earnings for the central tendency of earnings growth over the life cycle does not undo this

result. The result is due to heterogeneous variation around the central tendency.




                                                            6
       Of course, the exact result in equation (5) is particular to the very simple

assumptions of the model. A more realistic model would incorporate many additional

features including transitory earnings fluctuations, nonzero covariance between initial

earnings and earnings growth, nonlinear growth, and shocks with permanent effects.

While these features would lead to a more complex relationship between λt and t , they

clearly would not overturn the main qualitative results – that λt does not generally equal

1 and should be expected to vary over the life cycle.

       Figure 1 provides a pictorial version of the argument. The figure contains the

life-cycle log earnings trajectories of workers 1 and 2, with worker 2 attaining higher

lifetime earnings. Both trajectories display the familiar concave shape documented and

analyzed by Mincer (1974), and worker 2 experiences more rapid earnings growth

through most of the life cycle. The horizontal lines depict the log of the annuitized value

of each worker’s present discounted value of lifetime earnings. The difference between

the two workers’ log lifetime earnings therefore is simply the vertical distance between

the two horizontal lines. But how well is that difference estimated if it is proxied by the

difference in log earnings at a particular age? If the worker with higher lifetime earnings

has a steeper earnings trajectory, then the current earnings gap between the two workers

early in their careers tends to understate their gap in lifetime earnings (and could even

have the opposite sign). As the workers mature, this downward bias becomes less severe

until age t * , when the vertical distance between the current earnings trajectories equals

the distance between the horizontal lines. That is the age at which the textbook errors-in-

variables model is correct. For at least some of the life cycle beyond that age, the gap in

current earnings tends to overstate the gap in lifetime earnings.



                                              7
B. Implications for errors-in-variables biases

         Suppose we wish to estimate the regression model

(6)      y i = β ′X i + ε i

where the error term ε i is uncorrelated with the regressor vector X i . Starting with the

case of left-side measurement error, suppose that y i is the log of lifetime earnings, which

is not observed and hence is proxied by yit , log annual earnings at age t . In accordance

with the discussion in the preceding subsection, we do not assume the textbook errors-in-

variables model in equation (1). Instead, we generalize that model to

(7)      yit = λt yi + vit

where λt , the slope coefficient in the linear projection of yit on y i , need not equal 1 and

may vary over the life cycle. By construction, vit is uncorrelated with y i , and we will

continue to maintain the textbook model’s assumption that it also is uncorrelated with

each separate determinant of y i ( X i and ε i ).2 Then, if OLS is applied to the regression

of yit on X i ,

(8)      yit = λt β ′ X i + (λt ε i + vit ) ,

the probability limit of the estimated coefficient vector for X i is λt β instead of β . In

the textbook case where λt = 1 , measurement error in the dependent variable does not

result in inconsistent estimation of β . More generally, however, the OLS estimator is




2
 When this assumption fails, as it sometimes does, neither the textbook analysis nor our extension is
applicable. When Var (vit ) = 0 , equation (7) specializes to the rescaling of variables often discussed in
introductory econometrics textbooks (e.g., section 2.4 of Wooldridge, 2006). See section 4 of Angrist and
Krueger (1999) for an excellent overview of errors in variables, including non-classical measurement error.


                                                      8
inconsistent, and the inconsistency varies as a function of the age at which annual

earnings are observed.

        Moving on to the case of right-side measurement error, suppose that the log of

lifetime earnings is one element xi in the regressor vector X i . Because xi is not

observed, it is proxied by xit , log annual earnings at age t . Analogously to equation (7)

for yit , we express the linear projection of xit on xi as

(9)     xit = λt xi + vit

where vit again is assumed to be uncorrelated with X i and ε i . If xi is the only element

in X i and OLS is applied to the linear regression of y i on xit , the probability limit of the

estimated slope coefficient is

                  Cov( xit , y i )
(10)    plim βˆ =                  = θt β
                   Var ( xit )

where

               Cov( xit , xi )       λtVar ( xi )
(11)    θt ≡                   = 2                         .
                Var ( xit )     λt Var ( xi ) + Var (vit )

The inconsistency factor θ t , sometimes referred to as the “reliability ratio,” is most

simply interpreted as the slope coefficient in the “reverse regression” of xi on xit . In the

textbook case where λt = 1 , this factor simplifies to the familiar attenuation factor

Var ( xi ) /[Var ( xi ) + Var (vit )] . More generally, the factor θ t also depends on the value of

λt . Indeed, with λt < 1 and sufficiently small Var (vit ) / Var ( xi ) , θ t can exceed 1 so that

the errors-in-variables bias is an amplification bias rather than an attenuation bias.




                                                      9
        Two further results about right-side measurement error are worth noting. First, if

xi is just one element in the regressor vector X i , the attenuation factor for its estimated

coefficient is the same as the last expression in equation (11) except with Var ( xi )

replaced by the residual variance from the auxiliary regression of xi on the other

regressors in X i . Second, if the measurement error in xit as a proxy for xi is treated

with an instrumental variable (IV) correlated with xi but uncorrelated with ε i or vit , the

probability limit of the conventional IV estimator of the coefficient of xi is the

coefficient divided by λt .3

        The results presented in this subsection deliver two key messages. First, with

plausible departures from the textbook errors-in-variables assumptions, the familiar

textbook results about OLS and IV estimation are overturned. Measurement error in the

dependent variable is not innocuous for consistency, and measurement error in the

explanatory variable can induce either amplification or attenuation inconsistency in OLS

estimation as well as in IV estimation. Second, some of the estimation inconsistencies

from using log annual earnings as a proxy for log lifetime earnings can be summarized

with just two simple parameters: the slope coefficient in the “forward regression” of log

annual earnings on log lifetime earnings and the slope coefficient in the “reverse

regression” of log lifetime earnings on log annual earnings. In section IV, we will

estimate those two parameters and examine how they vary over the life cycle.




3
 The inconsistency of conventional IV estimation in the presence of non-classical measurement error has
been discussed previously by Kane, Rouse, and Staiger (1999), Bound and Solon (1999), and Kim and
Solon (2005).

                                         III. Data and Methods

A. Data

         Most U.S. studies of the relationship between current and lifetime income

variables have been based on longitudinal survey data from only a limited portion of the

respondents’ careers. In contrast, like Bjorklund’s (1993) study of Swedish income tax

data, our study is based on nearly career-long earnings histories. This information is now

available for a U.S. sample because, in accordance with an agreement with the Social

Security Administration, the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center asked the

participants in its Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to permit access to their Social

Security earnings histories for 1951-1991.4 The HRS sample is a national probability

sample of Americans born between 1931 and 1941, and about ¾ of the respondents

agreed to permit access to their Social Security earnings histories. As shown in Haider

and Solon (2000), in terms of observable characteristics, the respondents that granted

access appear to be surprisingly representative of the complete sample. The earnings data

supplied by the Social Security Administration round the earnings observations to the

nearest hundred dollars, with a distinction made between zero and positive amounts less

than $50.

         Our analysis is for male HRS respondents born between 1931 and 1933, who

were about 19 years old at the beginning of the 1951-1991 earnings period and about 59

at the end. Thus, for the 821 men in our analysis, we have annual earnings information




4
  Because of the highly confidential nature of the data, the earnings histories are not part of the HRS public
release data sets, but are provided only through special permission from the Survey Research Center. For
information on accessing “HRS restricted data,” see the HRS website http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu. For
more general information on the HRS, see the website or Juster and Suzman (1995).


                                                     11
for every year over the major portion of their careers.5 The other main strength of our

data set is that the Social Security earnings histories tend to be more accurate than the

survey reports of earnings used in most previous research. Indeed, Bound and Krueger’s

(1991) influential study of errors in earnings reports in the Current Population Survey

used Social Security earnings data as the “true” values against which the Current

Population Survey measures were compared.

         The strengths of the Social Security earnings data are accompanied by two serious

limitations. First, the earnings data pertain only to jobs covered by Social Security.

According to Social Security Administration (1999, table 3.B2), the percentage of

earnings covered by Social Security has exceeded 80% ever since the coverage

extensions effected by 1957 and exceeded 85% over most of our sample period. Between

1951 and 1956, however, this percentage ranged between 66 and 79%. Accordingly, in

addition to our analyses for 1951-1991, we also will report results for 1957-1991.

         Second, the Social Security earnings in our data are measured only up to the

maximum amount subject to Social Security tax. In some years, the proportion of

observations that are “right-censored” is quite large. For the 821 men in our sample,

table 1 displays the median observed earnings, the percentage in the sample with zero

earnings, the taxable limit, and the percentage with earnings at the taxable limit for each

year from 1951 to 1991. The table shows that, in the early years, very few sample

members are earning enough to approach the taxable limit. As their earnings grow over

their careers, however, the taxable limit becomes more constraining, especially in the

5
  This sample is restricted to workers with positive earnings in at least 10 years during 1951-1991. This
criterion, which excludes only 33 individuals, is less restrictive than the usual practice in survey-based
earnings dynamics studies of requiring positive earnings in every year (e.g., Abowd and Card, 1989; Baker,
1997). Within this sample, our main analysis includes years of zero earnings, but we also will report results
from an analysis based only on the positive earnings observations.


                                                    12
years when the taxable limit is low relative to the general earnings distribution. The

worst year is 1965, when 62% of the sample is right-censored. Afterwards, the degree of

censorship lessens as the taxable limit is progressively increased. By 1991, only 9% of

the sample is right-censored. Although some previous studies of current and lifetime

earnings have used annual earnings data with less severe right-censorship, their

observation of earnings usually has been limited to relatively short segments of the life

cycle. In effect, they have used restrictive models of earnings dynamics to impute

missing earnings data over most years of their sample members’ careers.

       If not for the right-censorship, we would follow Bjorklund’s (1993) approach of

directly summarizing the observed joint distribution of annual and lifetime earnings.

Because of the right-censorship, however, we are forced instead to estimate the joint

distribution in a way that imputes the censored right tails of the annual earnings

distributions. We describe our methods in the next subsection.



B. Econometric methods

       As explained above in section II.B, our ultimate goal is to summarize the

association between annual and lifetime earnings in terms of two types of parameters.

One is λt , the slope coefficient in the regression of log earnings in year t on the log of

the present value of lifetime earnings. The other is θ t , the slope coefficient in the reverse

regression of log lifetime earnings on log earnings in year t . If we had complete data, we

would estimate these parameters simply by applying least squares to the forward and

reverse regressions of the relevant variables.




                                              13
       Because of the censorship of the Social Security earnings data at the taxable limit,

however, we cannot observe the exact value of annual earnings in the cases where

earnings are right-censored and furthermore, in those cases, we also cannot compute the

present value of lifetime earnings. We therefore apply a three-step procedure for

estimating the λ and θ coefficients. First, we use a limited-dependent-variable model to

estimate the joint distribution of uncensored annual earnings in the 41 years from 1951

through 1991. Second, drawing from that estimated joint distribution, we generate a

simulated sample of uncensored earnings histories, for which we can calculate the present

discounted value of lifetime earnings. Third, using the uncensored earnings data for that

sample, we apply least squares to the forward and reverse regressions to obtain our

estimates of the λ and θ parameters.

       The key assumption in our first step is that the uncensored values of log annual

earnings over the 41 years from 1951 to 1991 follow a multivariate normal distribution.

Given this variant of the traditional Tobit assumption for limited dependent variables, the

joint distribution of the 41 annual earnings variables can be fully characterized by the

mean and variance of log earnings for each year and the cross-year autocorrelations of

log earnings for every pair of years.

       To estimate the year-specific means and variances for our sample cohort born in

1931-1933, we simply apply the conventional cross-sectional Tobit maximum likelihood

estimator separately for each year from 1951 to 1991. The only regressor in each year’s

equation is 1, the coefficient of which is the intercept. The estimated intercept is our

estimate of the cohort’s mean log earnings in that year. In our main analysis, we use a

two-limit Tobit model. The right-censorship threshold is the Social Security taxable limit




                                             14
for that year. The left-censorship threshold is $50. Observations of zero earnings and of

positive earnings less than $50 are both included as observations left-censored at $50.6

         Having estimated each year’s mean and variance in the cross-sectional Tobits, we

still need to estimate the autocorrelations between years. To obtain those estimates, we

apply the conventional bivariate Tobit maximum likelihood estimator separately for each

of the 41 × 40 / 2 = 820 distinct pairs of years in our 1951-1991 period. With those

autocorrelations estimated along with the mean and variance for every year, we have an

estimated version of the entire joint distribution of uncensored annual earnings over all

41 years.

         In the second step of our procedure, we use our estimated joint distribution of

uncensored earnings for 1951-1991 to perform the following simulation. First, we take

4,000 random draws from the estimated joint distribution of the 41 years of annual

earnings.7 Then, for each of the 4,000 simulated earnings histories, we calculate the

present discounted value of lifetime earnings. In the main version of the simulation, we

perform the discounting by (1) using the personal consumption expenditures deflator to

convert each year’s nominal earnings to a real value and (2) assuming a constant real

interest rate of 0.02. In the end, we have a simulated sample of 4,000 observations for

which we observe the present discounted value of lifetime earnings as well as each year’s

earnings.



6
  In the simulation described below, our treatment of zero-earnings observations as left-censored
observations from a lognormal distribution causes our simulated observations to include no zeros, but
instead small annual earnings values less than $50. The purpose of the simulation is to generate
observations for the present discounted value of lifetime earnings. For that purpose, the difference between
annual earnings of zero or a few dollars is of practically no consequence.
7
  To implement the simulation, we need the estimated autocovariance matrix to be positive semi-definite
(as the true one must be). Our procedure for imposing the restriction of positive semi-definiteness is
described in the appendix to this paper.


                                                    15
       Finally, for this sample of 4,000 individuals, we apply OLS to the regression of

each year’s log annual earnings on the log of the present value of lifetime earnings, and

thereby produce a λ̂t for each year from 1951 to 1991. Similarly, we obtain a θˆt for

each year by applying OLS to the reverse regression of the log of the present value of

lifetime earnings on each year’s log annual earnings. Plotting each of these coefficient

estimates over time depicts the life-cycle trajectory of the association between current

and lifetime earnings in a way that translates directly into implications for errors-in-

variables biases.



                                   IV. Empirical Results

       In the first step of our estimation procedure, the Tobit analysis described above

results in a 41× 41 estimated autocovariance matrix for log annual earnings from 1951 to

1991. The full matrix is provided in matrix.xls in a zip file available at

http://www.msu.edu/~haider. Table 2 shows the estimated autocorrelations for 1975-

1984, a period when our cohort born in 1931-1933 is between the ages of about 43 and

52. As shown in the second column of table 3, the first-order autocorrelations over this

period average to 0.89, the second-order autocorrelations average to 0.82, the third-order

autocorrelations average to 0.78, and so forth. Table 3 also displays estimated

autocorrelations from two other studies of administrative data. The most comparable

results reported in Baker and Solon’s (2003) study of Canadian income tax data are the

autocorrelations over the 1985-1992 period for the cohort born in 1942-1943. Their

average autocorrelations, shown in the third column, are fairly similar to ours, but

somewhat lower. As shown in the fourth column, the estimates from Bohlmark and



                                             16
Lindquist (2005), a replication of our study based on Swedish income tax data, are closer

to ours than to Baker and Solon’s. Note that this resemblance between other studies’

estimates and ours occurs even though the other studies use uncensored data and

therefore can estimate the autocorrelations directly without imposing distributional

assumptions.8 We find it reassuring that, despite the omission of earnings not covered by

Social Security and the imputation of right-censored values, our autocorrelation estimates

are similar to those from other data sets. Most of these estimated autocorrelations are

somewhat higher than those reported by Baker (1997) and Haider (2001) in their analyses

of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, but the survey-based estimates may be biased

downward by reporting error.

         Another relevant comparison is to an alternative earnings variable available for

our sample for 1980-1991. For those years, in addition to the Social Security earnings

data, the Survey Research Center also has obtained earnings data from employers’ W-2

reports to the Internal Revenue Service. Unlike the Social Security data, the W-2

variable includes earnings not covered by Social Security, and it is right-censored (for

confidentiality reasons) at $125,000, which is far less constraining than the Social

Security taxable limits listed in table 1. On the other hand, the W-2 variable leaves out

self-employment earnings and earnings allocated to 401(k) pensions. As shown in the

fifth column of table 3, when we use the W-2 data to reestimate our Tobits for 1980-

1991, the first-order autocorrelations average to 0.89, the second-order autocorrelations

average to 0.83, and the third-order autocorrelations average to 0.79. As shown in the

last column, the corresponding average autocorrelations for the Social Security earnings


8
 Also like these other studies, we find that earnings autocorrelations are somewhat smaller early in the life
cycle.


                                                     17
variable over the same period are 0.91, 0.85, and 0.81. The idiosyncrasies of the

alternative earnings measures do not appear to generate major discrepancies in the

estimated persistence of earnings.9

         In the second step of our estimation procedure, we perform the simulation in

which we take 4,000 draws from the estimated joint distribution of the 41 years of annual

earnings. Then, using the resulting sample of 4,000 uncensored earnings histories, our

third step summarizes the connection between annual and lifetime earnings by estimating

the forward and reverse regressions between the logs of annual and lifetime earnings.

         The top portion of figure 2 plots our estimates of λt , the slope coefficient in the

regression of log annual earnings at time t on the log of the present value of lifetime

earnings. To focus on the life-cycle variation in λt , we express t on the horizontal axis

as year minus 1932, which gives the approximate age of our 1931-1933 cohort in each

year.10 In contrast to the textbook assumption that λt equals 1 throughout the life cycle,

λ̂t begins at 0.24 at age 19, increases steadily until it rises to about 1 at age 32, and then

declines some in the late forties. The main implication is that, contrary to the textbook

errors-in-variables model, using log current earnings to proxy for log lifetime earnings as

the dependent variable can induce an errors-in-variables bias. Most importantly, using

current earnings in the twenties causes a large attenuation bias. A constructive




9
  Perhaps the similarity of the autocorrelation estimates should not be a surprise. If one thinks of the log of
covered earnings as the sum of log total earnings and the log of the proportion covered, one would expect
the autocorrelation of log covered earnings to be approximately a weighted average of the autocorrelations
for log total earnings and log coverage. Presumably, both of these autocorrelations are highly positive. If
they are not very different from each other, then “averaging in” the coverage autocorrelation will not
produce a large bias in estimating the earnings autocorrelation.
10
   The point estimates plotted in figure 2 and the associated standard error estimates are tabulated in our
appendix, which also describes our bootstrap procedure for estimating the standard errors.


                                                      18
implication is that the bias is small if one uses current earnings between the early thirties

and the mid forties, when the textbook assumption that λt = 1 is reasonably accurate.

        The lower portion of figure 2 shows the estimated life-cycle trajectory of the

reliability ratio θ t , the relevant parameter for assessing errors-in-variables bias from

using log annual earnings to proxy for log lifetime earnings as the explanatory variable in

a simple regression. θˆt begins at only about 0.2, increases to a fairly flat peak averaging

about 0.65 between the late twenties and mid forties, and then decreases. Our discussion

in section II.B showed that theoretically the errors-in-variables bias could be either an

attenuation bias or an amplification bias. Our empirical results, however, confirm the

conventional presumption that using current earnings to proxy for lifetime earnings as a

regressor induces an attenuation bias. The bias is especially large if current earnings are

measured early in the life cycle. There is a wide age range in mid-career when the errors-

in-variables bias stays about the same, but it remains quite substantial even in that range.

        To check the robustness of our main results, we have carried out a series of

sensitivity analyses, the results of which are displayed in figure 3. The first is motivated

by the question of how to treat years of zero earnings. Our main results are based on

two-limit Tobit estimates that retain observations of zero earnings in the analysis.

Because most previous analyses of earnings dynamics, however, have excluded

observations of zero earnings, we supplement our main analysis with another that

excludes the zeros, codes positive earnings less than $50 as $25, and estimates one-limit

Tobits with only right-censorship. As shown in table 1, zero earnings are especially

prevalent in the early years of our sample, both because many of our sample members are

not yet working for pay and because the Social Security system’s coverage is less



                                              19
extensive before 1957. We therefore conduct this analysis only for 1957-1991.

Excluding the zeros changes the estimates of the variances and autocovariances in log

annual earnings, but because those changes are roughly proportional, the estimated

autocorrelations are similar to those in the main analysis. Accordingly, the new estimates

of λt and θ t shown in figure 3 are similar to the estimates from our main analysis

repeated from figure 2.

         Our second and third robustness checks explore the sensitivity of our results to

our choice of interest rate series. In our main simulation, we calculated the present

discounted value of lifetime earnings by (1) using the personal consumption expenditures

deflator to convert each year’s nominal earnings to a real value and (2) assuming a

constant real interest rate of 0.02. Our third supplementary analysis uses a real interest

rate of 0.04, and our fourth discounts nominal earnings by a nominal interest rate series,

the annual one-year T-note interest rates.11 The results shown in figure 3 are quite similar

to those based on our original interest rate series.

         Fourth, we have checked whether our results are affected by the Health and

Retirement Study’s oversampling of blacks, Hispanics, and residents of Florida. To do

so, we have reestimated the joint distribution of earnings with a Tobit quasi-maximum

likelihood procedure that weights each observation’s contribution to the likelihood

function by its inverse probability of selection into the sample. The resulting Tobit

estimates are very similar to those from our original unweighted analysis, and

consequently the new estimates of λt and θ t are again very similar to the main estimates.



11
  This series is available only back to 1954. For 1951-1953, we added 0.003 to the interest rates for three-
month T-bills. This adjustment was based on the relationship between the one-year and three-month rates
observed for 1954-1959.


                                                     20
       Finally, figure 3 includes the results of Bohlmark and Lindquist’s (2005)

replication of our main analysis based on Swedish income tax data. This comparison is

particularly interesting because Bohlmark and Lindquist’s data are largely free of the

censorship and coverage issues that afflict our U.S. Social Security earnings data. As a

result, Bohlmark and Lindquist estimate λt and θt directly with the forward and reverse

regressions involving log current and lifetime earnings without having to resort to our

more complex estimation procedure based on the multivariate normality assumption.

Their estimates of λt in the twenties are somewhat higher than ours, but still much less

than 1. In general, the patterns of the Swedish and U.S. results are strikingly similar.



                               V. Summary and Discussion

       All of our analyses tell the same story: contrary to the textbook errors-in-variables

model usually assumed in applied research, the slope coefficient in the regression of log

current earnings on log annual earnings varies systematically over the life cycle and is not

generally equal to 1. We can illustrate the usefulness of our results by applying them to

the intergenerational mobility regression in which son’s log of lifetime earnings is the

dependent variable and father’s log of lifetime earnings is the explanatory variable. As

summarized in Solon (1999), most recent research in that literature has devoted

considerable attention to the right-side measurement error from using short-run proxies

for father’s lifetime earnings. Our estimates of θ t shown in figures 2 and 3 confirm the




                                             21
literature’s presumption that right-side measurement error causes an attenuation

inconsistency in OLS estimation of the intergenerational elasticity.12

         The literature, however, has given much less attention to the left-side

measurement error from using short-run proxies for son’s lifetime earnings. Presumably,

this neglect reflects an assumption by researchers that, in accordance with the textbook

errors-in-variables model, left-side measurement error is innocuous for consistency. All

our estimates of λt suggest that assumption would be fairly well founded if sons’

earnings were measured between the early thirties and mid forties. Many

intergenerational mobility studies, however, have measured sons’ earnings at earlier ages,

and this has substantially affected the findings. Reville (1995), for example, estimates

intergenerational elasticities of about 0.25 when he measures the sons’ earnings in their

twenties, but his estimates start approaching 0.5 when he observes the sons well into their

thirties. This is just the pattern one should expect from the trajectories of λ̂t in figures 2

and 3. An important implication is that many estimates of the intergenerational earnings

elasticity have been subject to substantial attenuation inconsistency from left-side

measurement error in addition to the well-known inconsistency from right-side

measurement error.

         Of course, interpreting evidence on intergenerational earnings mobility is just one

example of how our results might be applied. We advise readers, however, to exercise

due caution in importing our estimates of λt and θ t to other earnings data. We already


12
  Many researchers have attempted to reduce the attenuation inconsistency by averaging father’s log
earnings over multiple years. In an analysis summarized in our appendix, we repeat our estimation of     θt
except that the new estimates are for five-year averages of log annual earnings, rather than for single years.
Our results strongly support the conclusion of Mazumder (2001, 2005) that even estimates based on five-
year averages of the earnings variable for fathers are subject to a substantial errors-in-variables bias.


                                                     22
have mentioned issues of comparability between administrative and survey data.

Furthermore, the life-cycle trajectories for our U.S. cohort born in 1931-1933 may differ

from those for other cohorts and other countries. In addition, as emphasized in Solon

(1992), sample selection criteria that affect the sample’s dispersion in earnings also affect

the measurement error properties of current earnings as proxies for lifetime earnings.

Nevertheless, taking account of our evidence on departures from the textbook errors-in-

variables model should enable better-informed analyses of estimation biases in a wide

variety of research that uses current earnings variables as proxies for long-run earnings.

Notes: The plotted estimates are from five different analyses:
Main – main estimates copied from figure 2
(1) – same as main, but dropping zeros and estimating one-limit Tobits
(2) – same as main, but using 0.04 real interest rate
(3) – same as main, but discounting with one-year T-note interest rates
(4) – same as main, but weighting by inverse probabilities of selection
(5) – Swedish estimates from Bohlmark and Lindquist (2005)

A. Full estimated autocovariance matrix

       The complete 41× 41 matrix of estimated variances and autocorrelations from the

first step of our estimation procedure is in the spreadsheet matrix.xls, available in a zip

file at http://www.msu.edu/~haider.



B. Procedure for imposing positive semi-definiteness

       To implement the simulation in the second step of our estimation procedure, we

need the estimated autocovariance matrix of log earnings for 1951-1991 to be positive

semi-definite (as the true one must be). Our element-by-element method of estimation
                        ~
does not guarantee that Ω , our initial estimate of the autocovariance matrix, is positive

semi-definite, and it occasionally is not in some versions of our estimation. In those

instances, our procedure for imposing the restriction of positive semi-definiteness begins

by characterizing the population autocovariance matrix Ω in terms of the Cholesky

decomposition Ω = TT ′ where T is lower triangular. The matrix Ω is positive semi-

definite if and only if the diagonal elements of T are non-negative. Therefore, to obtain

a positive semi-definite estimate Ω̂ , we choose Tˆ to minimize the distance between
              ~
ˆ = TˆTˆ 'and Ω
Ω               subject to the constraint that the diagonal elements of Tˆ are non-

negative. We measure distance as the sum of squared deviations between the distinct
                                                 ~                         ~
elements in Ω̂ and the corresponding elements in Ω . On the occasions when Ω is not

positive semi-definite, it comes close, so the elements in Ω̂ differ only slightly from
         ~
those in Ω . We are very grateful to Jeff Wooldridge for his help in devising this method.

C. Estimates plotted in figure 2

       Table A1 provides the point estimates and associated standard error estimates

corresponding to figure 2 in the paper. The 95 percent confidence intervals plotted in

figure 2 are 1.96 estimated standard errors above and below the point estimates. The

standard error estimates are based on the following bootstrap procedure. We conduct 50

iterations of choosing new samples of size 821 by sampling with replacement from our

original sample of 821 individuals. For each of the bootstrap samples, we perform our

entire sequential estimation procedure to generate estimates of λt and θ t for each t . For

each parameter estimate plotted in figure 2 and listed in table A1, we estimate the

standard error with the sample standard deviation of that parameter estimate across the

bootstrap replications. The only departure from the estimation procedure used in our

main analysis is that, in the bootstrap replications, we use a different method for

imposing positive semi-definiteness of the autocovariance matrix. Instead of using the

method described in the previous section, we perform a spectral decomposition on the

estimated autocovariance matrix, set the negative eigenvalues to zero, and then re-

multiply the various elements together. This change greatly reduces the computational

time, and we have verified that the resulting positive semi-definite matrix is very similar

to what would be obtained using the previous method. Furthermore, to the extent that a

“closer” positive semi-definite matrix would exist, this simplification can be interpreted

as introducing noise into our bootstrap procedure, which probably would produce overly

large confidence intervals.

D. Estimates for five-year averages of log earnings

        Many intergenerational earnings mobility studies have attempted to reduce errors-

in-variables bias by averaging father’s log earnings over multiple years. To explore the

extent to which such averaging reduces bias, in figure A1 we repeat the analysis in figure

2 except that the new estimates of θ t are for five-year averages of log annual earnings,

rather than for single years. For example, the observation plotted for age 30 is based on a

five-year average for ages 28-32. As expected, the θˆt trajectory based on five-year

averages is higher than the one based on single-year earnings. Nevertheless, although the

estimates of θ t usually exceed 0.7 over a wide age range from 26 to 46, they never

exceed 0.8 by much. This finding strongly supports the conclusion of Mazumder (2001,

2005) that even estimates based on five-year averages of the earnings variable for fathers

are subject to a substantial errors-in-variables bias.

        The λ̂t based on a five-year average is algebraically identical to the simple

average of the single-year values of λ̂t for those five years. Consequently, as shown in

figure A1, the λ̂t trajectory based on five-year averages is just a smoothed version of the

trajectory in figure 2.
