                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a model of monetary exchange in bilateral over-the-counter markets to study the
effects of monetary policy on asset prices and financial liquidity. The theory predicts asset prices
carry a speculative premium that reflects the asset's marketability and depends on monetary
policy and the market microstructure where it is traded. These liquidity considerations imply a
positive correlation between the real yield on stocks and the nominal yield on Treasury bonds—
an empirical observation long regarded anomalous.

1    Introduction

We develop a monetary model of financial exchange in bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) markets
and use it to show how the details of the market microstructure and the quantity of money
(i ) shape the performance of OTC markets (e.g., as gauged by standard measures of market
liquidity), (ii ) generate speculative premia, and (iii ) explain the positive correlation between
the nominal yield on Treasury bonds and the real yield on stocks (the basis for the so-called
“Fed Model” of equity valuation popular among financial practitioners).
    We consider a setting in which a financial asset that yields a dividend flow of consumption
goods (e.g., an equity or a real bond) is traded by investors who have time-varying heterogeneous
valuations for the dividend. In order to achieve the gains from trade that arise from their
heterogeneous private valuations, investors participate in a bilateral market with random search.
In the bilateral market, which has the stylized features of an OTC market structure, investors
trade the financial asset using fiat money as a medium of exchange. Periodically, investors are
able to rebalance their portfolios in a frictionless (Walrasian) market.
    First, we use the theory to study the role that the quantity of money plays in shaping asset
prices and the performance of OTC markets more generally. Since money serves as means of
payment in financial transactions, the quantity of real balances affects the equilibrium allocation
of the asset. Anticipated inflation reduces real balances and distorts the asset allocation by
causing too many assets to remain in the hands of investors with relatively low valuations.
    Second, we show that in a monetary equilibrium the asset price is larger than the expected
present discounted value that any agent assigns to the dividend stream. This difference is a
“speculative premium” that investors are willing to pay because they anticipate capital gains
from reselling the asset to investors with higher valuations in the future. We show that the
speculative premium and the asset price depend on the market structure where the asset is
traded, e.g., both the premium and the asset price are decreasing functions of the expected
execution delay. This theoretical result is broadly consistent with the behavior of illiquidity
premia in response to variations in measures of trading activity documented in the recent
empirical literature.
    Third, we show how monetary policy affects speculative motives and the resulting specu-
lative premium. An increase in anticipated inflation reduces the real money balances used to
finance asset trading, which limits the ability of high-valuation traders to purchase the asset



                                                2
from low-valuation traders. As a result, the speculative premium and the real asset price are
decreasing in the expected rate of inflation. This mechanism rationalizes the positive correlation
between the real yield on stocks and the nominal yield on Treasury bonds—an empirical obser-
vation long regarded anomalous and that, for lack of an alternative theory, has been attributed
to money illusion since the 1970s. We also use the model to study the effects of monetary policy
on measures of financial liquidity of OTC markets, such as trade volume and price dispersion.
   The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3
describes the efficient allocation. Equilibrium is characterized in Section 4. Section 5 analyzes
the effects of monetary policy and OTC frictions on asset prices. Section 6 shows how monetary
policy and OTC frictions influence measures of market liquidity, such as trade volume and price
dispersion. In Section 7 we show asset prices typically exceed the expected present discounted
value that any agent assigns to the dividend stream by an amount that reflects a speculative
premium. In that section we also show the size of this speculative premium declines with infla-
tion and the degree of OTC frictions. In Section 8 we show our theory offers a novel theoretical
foundation for the “Fed Model”—a construct popular among practitioners and policymakers
that is based on the documented positive correlation between nominal bond yields and real
equity yields. Section 9 concludes. The appendix contains all proofs.

1.1   Related literature

This paper is related to three areas of research: search-theoretic models of money, search-
theoretic models of financial trade in OTC markets, and resale-option theories of asset pricing.
   From a methodological standpoint, this paper bridges the search-theoretic monetary litera-
ture that has largely focused on macro issues, and the search-theoretic financial OTC literature
that focuses on micro considerations in the market-microstructure tradition. Specifically, we
embed an OTC financial trading arrangement similar to Duffie et al. (2005) into a Lagos
and Wright (2005) economy. Here, money serves as a medium of exchange for financial as-
sets, whereas in the standard Lagos-Wright framework it is used as a medium of exchange for
consumption goods. This makes the financial OTC model in Duffie et al. (2005) amenable
to general equilibrium analysis, and delivers a natural transmission mechanism through which
monetary policy influences asset prices and the standard measures of financial liquidity that
are the main focus of the micro strand of the OTC literature.
   Geromichalos et al. (2007), Jacquet and Tan (2010), Lagos and Rocheteau (2008), Lagos


                                                3
(2010a, 2010b, 2011), Lester et al. (2012), and Nosal and Rocheteau (2013), introduce a real
asset that can (at least to some degree) be used along with money as a medium of exchange for
consumption goods in variants of Lagos and Wright (2005). These papers identify the liquidity
value of the asset with its usefulness in exchange, and find that when the asset is valuable
as a medium of exchange, this manifests itself as a “liquidity premium” that makes the real
asset price higher than the expected present discounted value of its financial dividend. High
anticipated inflation reduces real money balances; this tightens bilateral trading constraints,
which in turn increases the liquidity value and the real price of the asset. In contrast, here we
find that real asset prices are decreasing in the anticipated rate of inflation.1
       This paper shares with three recent papers, Geromichalos and Herrenbrueck (2016), Lagos
and Zhang (2018), and Trejos and Wright (2016), the general interest in bringing models of
OTC trade in financial markets into the realm of modern monetary general equilibrium theory.
Trejos and Wright (2016) offer an in-depth analysis of a model that nests Duffie et al. (2005) and
the prototypical “second generation” monetary search model with divisible goods, indivisible
money and unit upper bound on individual money holdings (e.g., Shi, 1995 or Trejos and
Wright, 1995). Trejos and Wright emphasize the different nature of the gains from trade in
both classes of models: In monetary models agents value consumption goods differently and
use assets to buy goods, while in Duffie et al. (2005) agents trade because they value assets
differently, and goods which are valued the same by all investors are used to pay for asset
purchases. In the formulation we study here, there are gains from trading assets, as in Duffie
et al. (2005), but agents pay with money, as in standard monetary models. Another difference
with Trejos and Wright (2016) is that rather than assuming indivisible assets and unit upper
bound on individual asset holdings as in Shi (1995), Trejos and Wright (1995) and Duffie et al.
(2005), we work with divisible assets and unrestricted portfolios, as in Lagos and Wright (2005)
and Lagos and Rocheteau (2009).
   1
    There are some models that also build on Lagos and Wright (2005) where agents can use a real asset
as collateral to borrow money that they subsequently use to purchase consumption goods. In those models,
anticipated inflation reduces the demand for real balances which can in turn reduce the real price of the collateral
asset needed to borrow money (see, e.g., He et al., 2012, and Li and Li, 2012). The difference is that in our
setup, inflation reduces the real asset price by constraining the reallocation of the financial asset from investors
with low valuations to investors with relatively high valuations. In the model that we study here, money is the
only asset used as means of payment. It would be straightforward, however, to enrich the asset structure so that
investors may choose to carry other real assets that can be used as means of payment in the OTC market, e.g.,
along the lines of Lagos and Rocheteau (2008) or Lagos (2010a, 2010b, 2011). As long as money is valued in
equilibrium, we anticipate that the main results emphasized here would continue to hold.

   Geromichalos and Herrenbrueck (2016) extend Lagos and Wright (2005) by incorporating
a real asset that cannot be used to purchase goods in the decentralized market. The twist
is that at the beginning of every period, agents learn whether they will want to buy or sell
consumption goods in the subsequent decentralized market, and at that point they have access
to a bilateral search market where they can retrade money and assets. This market allows
agents to rebalance their positions depending on their need for money, e.g., those who will be
buyers seek to buy money and sell assets. So although assets cannot be directly used to purchase
consumption goods, agents can use assets to buy goods indirectly, i.e., by exchanging assets
for cash in the additional bilateral trading round at the beginning of the period. Geromichalos
and Herrenbrueck use the model to revisit the link between asset prices and inflation. Their
core results are similar to those obtained in models where the asset can be used directly as
a medium of exchange for consumption goods, i.e., the asset carries a liquidity premium and
higher inflation increases the real asset price in the centralized market. There are relevant
differences between our work and Geromichalos and Herrenbrueck (2016). In the setup we
present here, money allows agents to exploit gains from trading assets (as in Duffie et al.)
rather than consumption goods (as in the money literature), which is why we instead find that
inflation reduces asset prices.
   In Lagos and Zhang (2018) we develop a related theory for OTC markets intermediated
by broker-dealers. That theory allows us to study the effect of monetary policy on spreads,
trade volume, and dealers’ incentives to supply liquidity services—the dimensions of financial
liquidity that search-based theories of OTC markets seek to explain. The theory we lay out here
is instead tailored to markets where trade is purely bilateral. This allows us to study the effect
of monetary policy on measures of financial liquidity that are characteristic of pure-bilateral
OTC markets, such as price dispersion.
   The fact that the equilibrium asset price is larger than the expected present discounted value
that any agent assigns to the dividend stream is reminiscent of the literature on speculative
trading that can be traced back to Harrison and Kreps (1978). As in Harrison and Kreps and
more recent work, e.g., Scheinkman and Xiong (2003a, 2003b) and Scheinkman (2013), specu-
lation in our model arises because traders have heterogeneous asset valuations that change over
time. Our model offers a new angle on the speculative premium embedded in the asset price, by
showing how it depends on the underlying financial market structure and the prevailing mone-
tary policy that jointly determine the likelihood and profitability of future resale opportunities.


                                                5
Through this channel our theory can generate a positive correlation between trade volume and
the size of speculative premia, a stylized fact emphasized by Scheinkman and Xiong (2003b).


2    The model

Time is represented by a sequence of periods indexed by t = 0, 1, .... Each time-period is divided
into two subperiods where different activities take place. There is a continuum of infinitely lived
investors, each identified with a point in the set I = [0, 1]. They discount payoffs across periods
with factor, β ∈ (0, 1). In every period there is a continuum of productive units (or trees) with
measure As ∈ R++ . Every productive tree yields an exogenous dividend yt ∈ R+ of a perishable
consumption good at the end of the first subperiod of period t. (Each tree yields the same
dividend as every other tree, so yt is also the aggregate dividend.) At the beginning of every
period t, every tree is subject to an independent idiosyncratic shock that renders it permanently
unproductive with probability 1 − π ∈ [0, 1) (unproductive trees physically disappear). If a tree
remains productive, its dividend in period t + 1 is yt+1 = γt+1 yt where γt+1 is a nonnegative
random variable with cumulative distribution function Γ, i.e., Pr (γt+1 ≤ γ) = Γ (γ), and mean
γ̄ ∈ (0, (βπ)−1 ). The time-t dividend becomes known to all investors at the beginning of period
t, and at that time each tree that failed is replaced by a new tree that yields dividend yt in
the initial period and follows the same stochastic process as other productive trees thereafter
(the dividend of the initial set of trees, y0 ∈ R++ , is given at t = 0). In the second subperiod
of every period, every investor has access to a linear production technology that transforms a
unit of the investor’s effort into a unit of a perishable homogeneous consumption good.
    Each productive tree has outstanding one durable and perfectly divisible equity share that
represents the bearer’s ownership of the tree and confers him the right to collect the dividends.
At the beginning of every period t ≥ 1, each investor receives an endowment of (1 − π) As equity
shares corresponding to the new trees created in that period. When a tree fails, its equity share
disappears with the tree. There is a second financial instrument, money, which is intrinsically
useless (it is not an argument of any utility or production function, and unlike equity, ownership
of money does not constitute a right to collect any resources). The stock of money at time t is
denoted Am                                m                        m       m
         t . The initial stock of money, A0 ∈ R++ , is given, and At+1 = µAt , with µ ∈ R++ .
A monetary authority injects or withdraws money via lump-sum transfers or taxes in the second
subperiod of every period. At the beginning of period t = 0, each investor is endowed with
a portfolio of equity shares and money. All financial instruments are perfectly recognizable,

                                                6
cannot be forged, and can be traded among investors in every subperiod.
       In the second subperiod of every period, all investors can trade the consumption good
produced in that subperiod, equity shares, and money, in a spot Walrasian market. In the first
subperiod of every period, trading is organized as follows: Investors can trade equity shares
and money in a random bilateral OTC market. We use α ∈ [0, 1] to denote the probability
that an individual investor is able to contact another investor in the OTC market. Once the
two investors have contacted each other, the pair negotiates a trade involving equity shares and
money. We assume that, with probability η ∈ [0, 1], the terms of the trade are chosen by the
investor who values the equity dividend the most, and by the other investor with complementary
probability.2 After the transaction has been completed, the investors part ways. The timing
assumption is that the round of OTC trade between investors takes place in the first subperiod of
a typical period t, and ends before trees yield dividends. Hence equity is traded cum dividend in
the OTC market of the first subperiod, but ex dividend in the Walrasian market of the second
subperiod. We assume that investors cannot make binding commitments, that there is no
enforcement, and that histories of actions are private in a way that precludes any borrowing and
lending, so any trade must be quid pro quo. This assumption and the structure of preferences
described below create the need for a medium of exchange.3
       An individual investor’s preferences are given by
                                              ∞
                                              X
                                         E0         β t (εti yti + cti − hti )
                                              t=0

where yti is the quantity of the dividend good that investor i consumes at the end of the first
subperiod of period t, cti is his consumption of the homogeneous good that is produced, traded
and consumed in the second subperiod of period t, and hti is the utility cost from exerting hti
units of effort to produce this good. The variable εti denotes the realization of a preference shock
that is distributed independently over time and across investors, with a differentiable cumulative
                                                                     R
distribution function G on the support [εL , εH ] ⊆ [0, ∞], and ε̄ = εdG (ε). Investor i learns
his realization εti at the beginning of period t, before the OTC trading round. The expectation

      Notice that under these conditions there cannot exist a futures market for fruit, so an investor who wishes
to consume the fruit dividend must be holding the equity share at the time the dividend is paid. A similar
assumption is typically made in search models of financial OTC trade, e.g., see Duffie et al. (2005) and Lagos
and Rocheteau (2009).

investor’s preference shock and the random trading process in the OTC market.


3    Efficiency

Consider a social planner who wishes to maximize the sum of investors’ expected discounted
utilities, subject to the same meeting frictions that investors face in the decentralized formula-
tion. Specifically, in the first subperiod of every period, the planner can only reallocate assets
within the pairs of the measure α of investors who have contacted each other directly. Let
Bt ⊆ I denote the subset of investors who get a bilateral trading opportunity with another
investor in the OTC market of period t. For any i ∈ Bt , let b (i) ∈ Bt denote investor i’s partner
                                      R
in the bilateral meeting. Notice that Bt di = α is the measure of investors who have an OTC
                                    R
meeting with another investor, and Bt I{i≤b(i)} di = α/2 is the total number of direct bilateral
transactions between investors in the OTC market. We restrict attention to symmetric alloca-
tions (identical agents receive equal treatment). Let ct (ε) and ht (ε) denote consumption and
production of the homogeneous consumption good in the second subperiod of period t by an
investor with idiosyncratic preference type ε. Let ãt denote the beginning-of-period-t (before
depreciation and endowment) asset holding of an investor. Finally, let atij (εi , εj ) denote the
post-trade equity holding of an investor i with preference type εi who has a direct bilateral
trade opportunity with an investor j with preference type εj . The planner’s problem consists
of choosing a nonnegative allocation,

                                        ti , ati ) at the beginning of the OTC round of period
t. Let Wt (at ) denote the maximum expected discounted payoff of an investor who is holding
portfolio at at the beginning of the second subperiod of period t (after the trees have borne
dividends). Then,
                                                                          Z                         

where Tt is the real value of the time-t lump-sum monetary transfer (tax, if negative). Since
ε is i.i.d. over time, Wt (at ) is independent of ε and the portfolio that each investor chooses
to carry into period t + 1 is independent of ε. Consequently, in what follows we can write
dHt (ati , ε) = dFt (ati ) dG (ε), where Ft is the joint cumulative distribution function of investors’
money and equity holdings at the beginning of the OTC round of period-t.
    Consider a bilateral meeting in the OTC trading round of period t, between investor i with
portfolio ati and preference type εi , and investor j with portfolio atj and preference type εj . Let

The first two constraints imply that in a bilateral meeting the two investors can (only) reallocate
money and assets between themselves. The third constraint ensures it is individually rational
for investor j to accept i’s offer. The following result characterizes the bargaining outcome.

Lemma 1 Consider the bargaining problem between investor i with portfolio (am     s
                                                                            ti , ati ) and pref-

of period t. Suppose that investor i has the power to choose the terms of trade, then his post-
trade portfolio is ati∗ = (am        s

am     m     m
 tj + ati − ati∗ .


    In Lemma 1, if εj < εi , then investor i wishes to purchase all of investor j’s equity. Since
he has all the bargaining power, investor i sets the terms of trade at pt (εj ) dollars per equity
share, i.e., the dollar price of equity that makes investor j just indifferent between selling equity
for dollars or not. The quantity of equity that investor i is able to purchase will depend on
his money holdings, am        m             s
                     ti . If ati ≥ pt (εj )atj , then he buys all of investor j’s equity holdings,
astj , in exchange for pt (εj )astj dollars. If am             s
                                                 ti < pt (εj )atj , then i gives investor j all his money

                                     pt (εj )   equity shares. Conversely, if εi < εj , then investor i wishes


                                                            11
to sell all of his equity to investor j. Similarly, the quantity of equity that investor i will sell to
investor j depends on j’s money holdings, am        m             s
                                           tj . If atj ≥ pt (εj )ati , then j buys all of investor i’s
equity holdings, asti , in exchange for pt (εj )asti dollars. If am             s
                                                                  tj < pt (εj )ati , then j gives investor i

be substituted in the value function (7) to obtain the following result.

Lemma 2 The value function of an investor who enters the OTC round of period t with port-
folio ati = (am     s

where I{εj ≤εi } is an indicator function that takes the value 1 if εj ≤ εi , and 0 otherwise.

    To interpret (8), notice that the first line represents the value to the investor of holding the
portfolio of money and equity until the end of the period. The remaining two terms represent
the expected net gains from trading with another investor in the OTC market. Consider the
penultimate term: with probability α the investor contacts another investor in the OTC market,
if the other investor’s preference type, εj , is smaller than εi , then the investor with preference
type εi has the bargaining power with probability η and he spends min [am              s
                                                                        ti , pt (εj ) A ] dollars
purchasing min [am               s
                 ti /pt (εj ) , A ] equity shares from the other investor, for a net gain from trade
equal to
                                                                        (εi − εj ) yt

                                                                                            t ati , (εj yt + φt )A ] .

of purchasing a dollar in the second subperiod of period t. The right side is the discounted
expected benefit from carrying this additional dollar into the following period, which consists of
three components: (i ) the expected benefit from holding the dollar until the second subperiod

the expected gain from using the dollar to purchase equity from another investor in the OTC
market of period t + 1. To interpret (9), it is useful to rewrite it as

            t+1 ≡ I ãt+1i di and Ãt+1 ≡ I ãt+1i di denote the aggregate quantities of money and
shares held by investors at the end of period t. We are now ready to define equilibrium.

Definition 1 An equilibrium is a sequence of terms of trade in the OTC market, {hati∗ , ati ii∈I }∞
                                                                                                  t=0 ,
as given in Lemma 1, together with a sequence of asset holdings, {hat+1i , ãt+1i ii∈I }∞
                                                                                        t=0 , and


                                                      14
prices, {ψ t }∞       m s ∞
              t=0 ≡ {φt , φt }t=0 , such that for all t, (i) the asset allocation solves the investor’s
optimization problem (6) taking prices as given, and (ii) prices are such that all Walrasian
markets clear, i.e., Ãst+1 = As (the end-of-period-t Walrasian market for equity), Ãm      m
                                                                                      t+1 = At+1
(the end-of-period-t Walrasian market for money). An equilibrium is “monetary” if φm
                                                                                   t > 0 for
all t, and “nonmonetary” otherwise.

    In what follows, we specialize the analysis to stationary equilibria in which real asset prices
are time-invariant functions of the aggregate dividend, i.e., φst = φs yt and φm  m
                                                                               t At = Zyt . Hence,
in a stationary equilibrium, φst+1 /φst = γt+1 and φm   m
                                                    t /φt+1 = µ/γt+1 . Throughout the analysis
we let β̄ ≡ βγ̄ and maintain the assumption µ > β̄, but the following proposition considers the
limiting case µ → β̄.

Proposition 2 The allocation implemented by the stationary monetary equilibrium converges
to the symmetric efficient allocation as µ → β̄.

         B denote the nominal price in the second subperiod of period t of an N -period risk-
    Let qt,k
free pure-discount nominal bond that matures in period t + k, for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N (so k is
the number of periods until the bond matures). Assume that the bond is illiquid in the sense
that it cannot be traded in the OTC market. Then in a stationary monetary equilibrium,
 B = (β̄/µ)k , and
qt,k
                                              µ − β̄
                                                       ι=                               (11)
                                                β̄
is the time-t nominal yield to maturity of the bond with k periods until maturity. Thus, the
optimal monetary policy described in Proposition 2 in which the money supply grows at rate β̄
can be interpreted as a policy that implements the Friedman rule, i.e., ι = 0 for all contingencies
at all dates.

   A stationary monetary equilibrium does not exist if the inflation rate is too high, i.e., if
µ ≥ µ̃, and in this case there is no equity trade and the equity price is equal to the expected
discounted present value of the dividend. If the inflation rate is low enough, i.e., µ ∈ (β̄, µ̃),
then a unique stationary equilibrium exists. In this case an investor i starts every period t with
a portfolio of money and equity, and he is randomly matched with another investor j during
the OTC round of trade. If i’s preference shock is larger than j’s, i.e., if εj < εi , then i will
want to purchase all of j’s equity holdings. Whether he is able to do so depends the quantity
of assets that j holds, which in equilibrium equals As , and the dollar price that i has to pay
for the equity. In turn, the dollar price will depend on whether investor i or investor j has the
bargaining power. If i has the power (this happens with probability η), then the dollar price he

which using (14) can be rewritten as εj             ≤ εc . Thus as µ falls, real balances and εc increase, and
the investor who wishes to buy equity and has the bargaining power, is cash constrained in a

smaller fraction of the bilateral meetings. The value of money depends on the gains from trade
of the relatively high valuation investors who buy equity. The equity price (13) on the other
hand, reflects the gains from trade of the relatively low valuation investors who sell equity in
bilateral transactions (α (1 − η) ϕ (εc ) captures the expected gain from selling equity to another
investor in the OTC round).


5     Asset prices

In this section we study the properties of the equilibrium asset prices characterized in Propo-
sition 3. We focus on how they depend on monetary policy and the degree of OTC frictions.

5.1   Inflation

The real price of equity in a monetary equilibrium is in part determined by the option available
to low-valuation investors to resell the equity to high-valuation investors. A higher inflation
rate causes real money balances to decline. This reduction in real balances enlarges the set of
joint realizations of preference types in bilateral meetings in which the cash constraint binds
for high-valuation buyers. In turn, this reduces the value of the marginal preference type, εc ,
of the buyer who is just able to purchase all of the equity from a seller in a bilateral meeting
in which the seller has the bargaining power. The result is that ex ante, the period before the
OTC round, investors anticipate that the expected gains from selling equity in the OTC market
are smaller, and this manifests itself as a smaller equity price in the centralized round of trade.
The following proposition formalizes this intuition.

Proposition 4 In the stationary monetary equilibrium: (i) ∂φs /∂µ < 0, (ii) ∂Z/∂µ < 0 and
∂φm
  t /∂µ < 0.


5.2   OTC frictions: trading delays and market power

The value of holding equity increases with the bilateral meeting probability, as this increases the
probability that the investor may find an opportunity to sell the asset to another investor with
higher valuation. Similarly, the value of money increases with α as this increases the probability
the investor may be able to use money to buy equity if he were to meet a counterparty with
lower valuation.



                                                17
Proposition 5 In the stationary monetary equilibrium: (i) ∂φs /∂α > 0, (ii) ∂Z/∂α > 0 and
∂φm
  t /∂α > 0.


    The effect of the bargaining power of asset buyers, η, on the asset price is non-monotonic.
When η is 0, investors receive no trade surplus when they buy assets. So, they have no incentive
to hold money and there does not exist monetary equilibrium, nor trade. The value of the option
to resell the equity is then zero. When η is equal to 1, investors receive no trade surplus when
they sell assets. The value of the option to resell the equity is also zero. The value of the resale
option may be positive when η is between 0 and 1.


6     Financial liquidity

In this section we use the theory to study the determinants of two standard measures of market
liquidity: trade volume and price dispersion.

6.1   Volume

According to Lemma 1, the quantity traded in a meeting between two investors depends on
whether the buyer or the seller of equity has the bargaining power. Suppose that investor i
has preference type εi and investor j has preference type εj < εi . If investor i (in this case the
                                                                                  Z

                                                t /pt (εj ) , A } = I{εc <εj } εj +φs + I{εj ≤εc } A
                                                                                                     s

equity shares. Conversely, if investor j has the bargaining power, then investor i purchases
                                        Z
min {Am              s                                    s

equity shares traded in the OTC market is

In trades where the investor with no bargaining power has preference type ε < εc , all the equity
holdings of the seller, As , are traded. In meetings where the investor with no bargaining power
                                                                                                           Z         (εc +φs )As
has preference type ε > εc , the cash constraint of the buyer binds, and only                           εj +φs    =    εj +φs
equity shares are traded. Notice that inflation only affects V indirectly, through its                            effect on εc
(or equivalently, real balances, Z). Higher inflation reduces the value of real balances and this
implies that the cash constraint will bind in more trades, causing trade volume to decline along

                                                           18
the intensive margin (i.e., by reducing the quantity of equity traded in trades in which the agent
with no bargaining power has relatively high valuation for the dividend). An increase in the
contact probability α increases V along the extensive margin (more meetings among investors
naturally result in larger trade volume), but an increase in α also increases real balances and
therefore induces an increase in trade volume along the intensive margin. This intuition is
formalized in the following proposition.

Proposition 6 In the stationary monetary equilibrium: (i) ∂V/∂µ < 0, and (ii) ∂V/∂α > 0.

6.2      Price dispersion

In empirical work, measures of price dispersion are often used as proxies for market illiquidity.5

                                              E [pt (ε)]   E(ε) + φs
                  p
with SD(x) ≡          E[x − E(x)]2 , is a natural measure of dispersion in the transaction price in
the OTC market, pt (ε). Since Dts is decreasing in the asset price, φs , the following result is a
corollary of Propositions 4 and 5.

Proposition 7 In the stationary monetary equilibrium: (i) ∂Dts /∂µ > 0, and (ii) ∂Dts /∂α < 0.

       So far we have interpreted the asset in the model as an equity share.6 To think of the
asset as a bond, we can interpret yt as the coupon payment in period t, and δ ≡ (1 − π)−1 as
the (expected) time until the bond matures.7 Consider a set of N bonds, each indexed by a
different maturity, δs ≡ (1 − πs )−1 , with πs ∈ [0, 1] for s ∈ {1, . . . , N }. Then let pst (ε) denote
the cum-coupon nominal price in a bilateral transaction in the first subperiod of period t of
a bond with expected duration δs . For a bond of type s ∈ {1, . . . , N }, the bond yield for an
investor with valuation ε is
                                                     pst (ε)     ε

      See, e.g., Jankowitsch et al. (2011).

      While most equities in the US are traded in organized exchanges, one fifth of stocks are traded in OTC
markets. See Ang et al. (2013) for an empirical study on the liquidity and pricing of OTC-traded stocks. Most
fixed income securities, including Treasuries, are traded in OTC markets.

      This bond yields a stream of coupons {yt } until maturity, with no principal to be rapaid upon maturity.

illiquidity of bonds

the average yield of bond s on day t that results from a standard yield-curve fitting exercise.

with SD[rts (ε)] =    E[rts (ε) − r̄ts ]2 , would be an analogous marketwide average notion of price
dispersion, or pricing “noise.” The noise measure (18) is closely related to the price dispersion

                                              Dts ≈         .                                   (19)
                                                       φs
In this case, Dts ≈ SD[rts (ε)], so
                                               v
                                               u

                                          Nt ≈ t     (Dts )2 .                                  (20)

                                                         s=1

    The theoretical measure Nt is based on the yields implied by the whole cross section of
transaction prices on day t for each bond s. Suppose these detailed cross-sectional data were
not available, and that instead one is only able to obtain an imperfect proxy for SD[rts (ε)], for
instance, r̃ts − r̄ts , where r̃ts ≡ ε̃st /φs denotes an observation of the yield of bond s on day t.
Then,                                         v
                                              u
                                              u1 XN
                                        Ñt = t     (r̃ts − r̄ts )2 ,
                                                N
                                                      s=1

would be the corresponding proxy for Nt . Notice that Ñt coincides with the noise measure (17)
proposed by Hu et al. (2013) as long as their yield-curve estimation delivers estimates r̂ts that
are close to the true average yields r̄ts .

         Table 1: Response of noise measure for Treasury bonds to moneteray policy shocks.

        According to Proposition 7, the noise measure Nt should increase when monetary policy
tightens. This theoretical prediction can be tested by estimating the following regression:

                                   ∆Noiset = constant + b × ∆it + t ,                                      (21)

where ∆Noiset = Noiset+1 − Noiset , it is a proxy for the market expectation of the policy rate,
∆it = it − it−1 , and t is an error term.8 To deal with endogeneity of policy rate changes to
market liquidity, we use a standard instrument, the changes in Fed funds futures rate around a
narrow window before and after the announcements of FOMC meetings.9
        Table 1 reports the estimation results. Both, the change in policy rate and the noise measure
are expressed in basis points. The estimate of b is statistically significant at the 5% level (p-
value of 1.8%). The estimate implies that a 10-basis-point unexptected increase in the policy
rate increases the noise measure by about 6 basis points. Given (19) and (20), this result lends
empirical support to Proposition 7.


7        Speculation

According to Proposition 3, in a monetary equilibrium the equity price, φs , is larger than
the expected present discounted value that any agent assigns to the dividend stream, i.e.,
φ̂st ≡ β̄π/(1 − β̄π) ε̄yt . We follow Harrison and Kreps (1978) and call the value of the asset
                   

in excess of the expected present discounted value of the dividend under no trade, i.e., φst − φ̂st ,
    8
     We use the change in the illiquidity measure from date t to t + 1 because FOMC announcements are typically
made at around 2pm of a trading day. Since the number of transactions in the OTC market is small, the illiquidity
measure constructed from transaction data may respond with delay. Although monetary policy in the model we
presented above is deterministic, one could extend the theory to allow for random monetary policy shocks as in
Lagos and Zhang (2018). The key result that unexpected tightening of monetary policy lowers the asset price
and increases market illiquidity also holds in the stochastic formulation.
   9
     The data for the instrument and policy rate changes is from the online appendix of Gorodnichenko and
Weber (2016), which include 137 FOMC meeting announcments from February 4, 1994 to December 16, 2009.
The daily noise measure is from the online appendix of Hu et al. (2013).

the speculative premium which investors are willing to pay in anticipation of the capital gains
they will reap when reselling the asset to investors with higher valuations in the future.10
         According to Proposition 3, the speculative premium is Pt = Pyt , where

                                                β̄π
                                        P=            α (1 − η) ϕ (εc ) .
                                              1 − β̄π
Again, Pt ≥ 0, with “=” only if µ = µ̄. Higher inflation reduces real balances and therefore
εc , which reduces the expected resale value of equity in the OTC market, so P decreases with
inflation. An increase in the trade probability α has a positive direct effect on P (increase in the
meeting probability) and also an indirect positive effect (α increases εc which in turn increases
P). These effects are summarized below.

Proposition 8 In the stationary monetary equilibrium: (i) ∂P/∂µ < 0, and (ii) ∂P/∂α > 0.

         Notice that together, Proposition 5 and Proposition 6 imply that changes in the trading
probability will generate a positive correlation between trade volume and the size of the spec-
ulative premium.11 The positive correlation between trade volume and the size of speculative
premia is a feature of historical episodes that are usually regarded as bubbles—a point empha-
sized by Scheinkman and Xiong (2003a, 2003b) and Scheinkman (2013).


8         The Fed Model and the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis

The high inflation of the 1970s stimulated researchers to ask whether stocks are a good hedge
against inflation. In a well-known paper, Fama and Schwert (1977) found that, contrary to
long-held beliefs, common stocks were rather perverse as hedges against inflation. They found
that common stock returns were negatively related to the expected inflation rate during the
    10
      As in Harrison and Kreps (1978), investors exhibit speculative behavior if the right to resell a stock makes
them willing to pay more for it than they would pay if obliged to hold it forever. Investors exhibit speculative
behavior in the sense that they buy with the expectation to resell, and naturally the asset price incorporates the
value of this option to resell: investors are willing to pay more for the asset than they would pay if obliged to
hold it forever. This notion of speculative premium corresponds to the notion of speculative bubble that is used
in the modern literature on bubbles. See, e.g., Barlevy (2007), Brunnermeier (2003), Scheinkman and Xiong
(2003a,b), Scheinkman (2013), and Xiong (2013), who discuss Harrison and Kreps (1978) in the context of what
is generally known as the resale-option theory of bubbles. The notion of a “bubble,” however, requires one to
take a stand on a notion of “fundamental value,” which may open up several possibilities in economies where
investors have heterogeneous valuations. See Barlevy (2015) for a more in-depth discussion.
   11
      From a normative standpoint, our model implies that a large speculative premium is a sign of a better
allocation of the asset.



                                                       22
1953-71 period, and that they also seemed to be negatively related to the unexpected inflation
rate.12 In line with these observations, in the late 1970s Modigliani and Cohn (1979) pointed
out that the ratio of market value to profits of firms had declined consistently since the late
1960s. They observed that this fact was consistent with investors who capitalize equity earnings
using a nominal interest rate instead of a real one, and settled on this kind of money illusion as
the most reasonable explanation. More recently, Sharpe (2002), Asness (2000), Lansing (2004)
and many others have documented that yields on stocks (e.g., as measured by the dividend-
price ratio) are highly correlated with nominal bond yields.13 Since stocks are claims to cash
flows from real capital and inflation is the main driver of nominal interest rates, this correlation
has proven difficult to rationalize with conventional asset pricing theory.14
       Theory aside, this correlation has led financial practitioners to adopt the so-called Fed Model
of equity valuation to calculate the “correct” price of stocks.15 In its simplest form, the Fed
Model says that, because stocks and nominal Treasury bonds compete for space in investors’
portfolios, their yields should be positively correlated. That is, if the yield on bonds rises, then
the yield on stocks must also rise to maintain the competitiveness of stocks vis a vis bonds.
Practitioners use this reasoning to argue that the yield on nominal bonds (plus a risk premium
to account for the relative riskiness of stocks) defines a “normal” yield on stocks: if the measured
stock yield is below this normal yield, then stocks are considered overpriced; if the measured
stock yield is above this normal yield, then stocks are considered underpriced.16
  12
      At the time of Fama and Schwert’s writing, Lintner (1975), Jaffe and Mandelker (1976), Bodie (1976), and
Nelson (1976) had offered similar empirical evidence. Cagan (1974) is an early effort to study these issues using
some historical records.
   13
      Along similar lines, Bordo and Wheelock (2007) review the histories of major 20th century stock market
booms in the United States and nine other countries. They find that booms usually arose when inflation was below
its long-run average, and that booms typically ended when inflation began to rise and/or monetary authorities
tightened policy in response to rising or a threatened rise in inflation. Ritter and Warr (2002) argue that the
decline in inflation was a major factor leading to the bull market of 1982-1999.
   14
      See the discussions in Ritter and Warr (2002), Asness (2003), and Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004).
   15
      Sharpe (2002), Asness (2003), and Feinman (2005) discuss the popularity of the Fed Model among Wall
Street analysts and strategists.
   16
      The term Fed Model appears to have been first used by securities strategist Ed Yardeni in 1997 following
the publication of the Federal Reserve Humphrey-Hawkins Report for July 1997. In Section 2 (“Economic and
Financial Developments in 1997”), a chart plotted the time series for the earnings-price ratio of the S&P 500
against the 10-year constant-maturity nominal treasury yield and reported: “The run-up in stock prices in the
spring was bolstered by unexpectedly strong corporate profits for the first quarter. Still, the ratio of prices in
the S&P 500 to consensus estimates of earnings over the coming twelve months has risen further from levels that
were already unusually high. Changes in this ratio have often been inversely related to changes in long-term
Treasury yields, but this year’s stock price gains were not matched by a significant net decline in interest rates.
As a result, the yield on ten-year Treasury notes now exceeds the ratio of twelve-month-ahead earnings to prices
by the largest amount since 1991, when earnings were depressed by the economic slowdown.”


                                                        23
   The relationship between equity prices and monetary policy also appears to have been clear
in the minds of policymakers. Alan Greenspan, for example, famously held the view that stock
market booms are more likely to occur when inflation is low. He saw a dilemma in the use of
monetary policy to defuse stock market booms:

         “We have very great difficulty in monetary policy when we confront stock market bub-
     bles. That is because, to the extent that we are successful in keeping product price inflation
     down, history tells us that price-earnings ratios under those conditions go through the roof.
     What is really needed to keep stock market bubbles from occurring is a lot of product price
     inflation, which historically has tended to undercut stock markets almost everywhere. There
     is a clear trade-off. If monetary policy succeeds in one, it fails in the other. Now, unless
     we have the capability of playing in between and managing to know exactly when to push
     a little here and to pull a little there, it is not obvious to me that there is a simple set of
     monetary policy solutions that deflate the bubble.” (Alan Greenspan, FOMC transcript,
     September 24, 1996, pp. 30-31.)

The Fed model does not always hold in practice. For example, after the great recession, the
policy rate hit the zero lower bound. Gourio and Ngo (2016), among others, makes the point
that the correlation between inflation and the asset price may be quite different in this case. Our
theory and the empirical work in Lagos and Zhang (2018) focus on a particular transmission
channel through the liquidity of the financial market. While our findings support the Fed model,
the correlation between inflation and the asset price could depend on the relative relevance of
various transmission channels of monetary policy.
   To fix ideas, consider a standard Lucas (1978) economy in which a risk-neutral investor with
discount rate β prices a tree that is subject to a shock that renders it permanently unproductive
with probability 1 − π. Conditional on remaining productive, the tree yields real dividend Dt ,
with Dt+1 = γt+1 Dt , where γt+1 is a nonnegative random variable with mean γ̄ ∈ (0, (βπ)−1 ).
The real price of an equity share of the tree is
                                                     β̄π
                                           Pts =           Dt .
                                                   1 − β̄π
If we set Dt = ε̄yt , this is just the equity price in the nonmonetary equilibrium of Proposition
3. We can use this expression to obtain
                                        D̄t+1
                                              = (1 + r) − γ̄π,                                         (22)
                                         Pts

                                                    24
where D̄t+1 ≡ γ̄πDt denotes the expected dividend (conditional only on the tree having survived
period t) and 1 + r = 1/β is the real risk-free rate. Condition (22) is known as the “Gordon
growth model” (e.g., Gordon (1962), Williams (1938)). The left side is the dividend (or stock)
yield, which is equal to the real risk-free rate, 1 + r, minus the expected growth rate of the
real dividend, D̄t+1 /Dt = γ̄π. All the variables in (22) are real. In particular, since a rational
investor’s Euler equation equates the expected real equity return to the risk-free real interest
                                                        s +y

rate, i.e., Et Rt+1 = 1 + r, where Rt+1 ≡ π               Pts     ,   the investor uses the real interest rate
r to discount future dividends.17 According to the narrative behind the Fed Model, however,
investors allocate their portfolio between stocks and nominal long-term bonds by comparing
the expected real return on equity to the expected nominal bond yield, i.e., they use the wrong
                    s
Euler equation, Et Rt+1 = 1 + ι. This leads to

                                             D̄t+1
                                                   = (1 + ι) − γ̄π,
                                              Pts

which “explains” the positive relation between the nominal bond yield ι = (µ − β̄)/β̄ and the
stock yield D̄t+1 /Pts by saying that investors suffer from money illusion in the sense that they
discount future real dividends using the nominal rate, ι, rather than the real rate, r. This is the
Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. Financial analysts are often ambivalent toward the Fed Model.
On the one hand, “it works” empirically. On the other hand, they are reluctant to recommend
it to clients because the conventional logic behind it is fundamentally flawed; it is inconsistent
with investor rationality.18
  17
     As before, Et is the expectation over yt+1 , conditional on the information available in period t, as well as on
the tree surviving period t + 1.
  18
     For example, Feinman (2005) (Chief Economist at Deutsche Management Americas in New York) writes:
“If interest rates are to be brought into the calculus at all, they should be real rates, not nominal. This is not
to deny that equity prices seem to be set as if investors are comparing equity yields with nominal interest rates.
But this just demonstrates the error of money illusion. It should not be construed as recommending that error.”
Similarly, Asness (2003) writes: “Historically S&P 500 earnings-price ratio and 10-Year Treasury Rate have
been strongly related... The correlation of these two series over this period [1965-2001] is an impressive +0.81.
I am far from unique in presenting a graph like figure 1. It’s a rare Wall Street strategist that in the course of
justifying the Fed Model (or similar analytic) does not pull out a version of this figure... If you are trying to
explain why price-earning ratios are where they are, based on investors behaving in a similar manner in the past
(errors and all), then feel free to use the Fed Model (hopefully modified for volatility as in this paper), but do
not confuse that with a tool for making long-term recommendations to investors.” Siegel (2002): “It is true that
bonds are the major asset class that competes with stocks in an investor’s portfolio, so one might expect that
low interest rates would be favorable to stocks. But since in the long run low interest rates are caused by low
inflation, the rate of growth of nominal earnings, which depends in large part on the rate of inflation, will be
lower also. Over long periods of time, changes in the inflation rate cause changes in earnings growth of the same
magnitude and do not change the valuation of stocks.” See also Ritter and Warr (2002). Modigliani and Cohn



                                                         25
    Despite much skepticism, however, the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis remains the leading
explanation for the positive correlation between stock yields and nominal bond yields, and
for the empirical success of the Fed Model. Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) empirically
decompose the S&P500 stock yield into three components: (i ) a rational forecast of long-run
expected dividend growth, (ii ) a subjective risk premium (identified from a cross-sectional
regression), and (iii ) a residual “mispricing term.” They evaluate three hypotheses for why
low stock prices coincide with high inflation: (1) High inflation coincides with low expected
dividend growth. (2) High inflation coincides with a high (subjective) risk premium. (3)
Investors suffer from money illusion. Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) assess these hypotheses
by regressing the three components of the dividend yield (the expected dividend growth, risk
premium, and the residual mispricing term) on an exponentially smoothed moving average of
inflation. The regression coefficient of expected dividend growth on inflation is positive and
large, so the raw correlation between inflation and expected dividend growth is not negative
as required by the first hypothesis. The regression coefficient of the risk premium on inflation
is negative but small, indicating that the risk premium is not increasing with inflation as
required by the second hypothesis. Thus, Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) reject the two
conventional rational hypotheses for the positive correlation between the dividend yield and
inflation. The regression coefficient of the residual mispricing term on inflation is positive,
large, and statistically significant. Moreover, the R2 on this regression is 77.90, indicating
that inflation accounts for about 80% of the variability in the mispricing term. Based on
this evidence, Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) conclude that the positive correlation of the
dividend yield with inflation is mostly due to the mispricing term, i.e., stocks appear to be
undervalued by conventional measures when inflation is high.19 In the remainder of this section
(1979) themselves expressed some skepticism about their money illusion hypothesis: “. . . we readily admit that
our conclusion is indeed hard to swallow—and especially hard for those of us who have been preaching the gospel
of efficient markets. It is hard to accept the hypothesis of a long-lasting, systematic mistake in a well-organized
market manned by a large force of alert and knowledgeable people.”
   19
      To the extent that these types of studies do not fully control for risk, the results may confound the impact
of risk attitudes and attribute them to some anomaly such as money illusion. Cohen et al. (2005) revisit the
robustness of the results of Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) by further controlling for changes in the risk
premium. They exploit the fact that if the equity premium is high for risk-related reasons, then there is a cross-
sectional implication, namely that high-beta stocks should outperform low-beta stocks in such periods. The
Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that inflation-driven mispricing will apply to all stocks
equally, causing all stocks to be equally underpriced when inflation is high. Cohen et al. (2005) show the latter
is the case and interpret this as further confirmation of the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. Bekaert and Engstrom
(2010) find the bulk of the contribution to the covariance between equity and bond yields comes from the
positive comovements between expected inflation and a residual term, just like Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004).



                                                        26
we show our theory offers a novel explanation for this finding: the effects that inflation has on
asset prices through the liquidity (or resalability) channel. The new explanation we propose will
be transparent because our theory does not assume irrational investors that suffer from money
illusion and it abstracts from the other channels through which high inflation may depress real
asset prices, such as the possibility that it may adversely affect firms’ profitability or riskiness.20
    According to our theory, the equilibrium equity price is

where  (ι) ≡ ε̄ + α (1 − η) ϕ (εc ). Since εc is decreasing in the growth rate of the money supply,
µ, and the nominal bond yield, ι, is increasing in µ, we have 0 (ι) < 0. Let ȳt+1 ≡ γ̄πyt denote
the expected dividend (conditional only on the tree having survived period t). The log dividend
yield is
                            log ȳt+1 − log φst = log [(1 + r) − γ̄π] − log  (ι) ,                           (23)

and it is increasing in the nominal yield, ι. Thus, (23) rationalizes the Fed Model, despite the
fact that agents do not suffer from money illusion (they discount payoffs using the risk-free real
rate 1 + r), risk premia do not change (since agents are risk-neutral here), and the expected
growth rate of the dividend, γ̄π, is unaffected by monetary considerations.21
However, Bekaert and Engstrom (2010) claim that this is due to a correlation between expected inflation and
two plausible proxies for rational time-varying risk premia: a measure of economic uncertainty (the uncertainty
among professional forecasters regarding real GDP growth) and a consumption-based measure of risk aversion.
Thus, they offer a rational channel that could potentially explain why the Fed model “works:” their explanation
is that high expected inflation coincides with periods of high risk aversion and/or economic uncertainty, which
conflicts with Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) and Cohen et al. (2005). The papers differ on the specifics of
how they measure equity risk premia and on the sample period (Bekaert and Engstrom focus on the post-war
subsample while Campbell and Vuolteenaho and Cohen et al. go back to 1930s).
   20
      Basak and Yan (2010) explore the asset pricing implications of the money illusion hypothesis and Campbell
et al. (2014) focus on the monetary policy drivers of the riskiness of bonds and equities.
   21
      There is a literature that focuses on the effects of inflation on real prices of assets that trade in markets
were trading delays and intermediation costs are substantial, such as housing. For example, Brunnermeier and
Julliard (2008) decompose the housing price-rent ratio in the UK into three components: expected future returns
on housing investment, rent growth rates, and a mispricing component. They find that inflation and nominal
interest rates explain a large share of the time series variation in the mispricing term, and that through this
term, a reduction in inflation can generate substantial increases in housing prices. Like the literature discussed
in this section, they attribute this mispricing term to money illusion. Motivated by similar observations, Piazzesi
and Schneider (2008) develop a housing model with investors who suffer from money illusion (they believe that
changes in nominal interest rates reflect changes in real interest rates) and investors who understand the Fisher
equation (i.e., that bond returns are given by the nominal rate minus expected inflation). Since borrowing
is assumed to be backed by real estate, disagreement about real rates among investors increases house prices.
Through this mechanism, inflation shocks can cause house-price booms.

9    Conclusion

We have developed a model in which money is used as a medium of exchange in financial
transactions that take place in over-the-counter markets. In any monetary equilibrium the real
asset price contains a speculative premium that is positively related to the quantity of real
money balances and therefore negatively correlated with anticipated inflation and the long-
term nominal interest rate. As a result, the asset price generically exceeds the expected present
discounted value that any agent assigns to the dividend stream. We have shown that this
simple mechanism rationalizes the positive correlation between the real yield on stocks and
the nominal yield on Treasury bonds—an empirical observation long regarded anomalous. We
have also used the model to study how monetary considerations and the microstructure of the
market where the asset is traded jointly determine the standard measures of financial liquidity
of OTC markets, such as trade volume and price dispersion.
    The model could be useful to interpret the behavior of asset prices in OTC markets. Recently
Ang et al. (2013) have analyzed a large cross section of OTC-traded common stocks over time
and find that equity returns are increasing in the proportion of non-trading days (i.e., days in
which the stock was not traded) and decreasing in the trade volume of the stock. They interpret
these findings through the lens of asset pricing theories that emphasize differences in investors’
individual valuations (e.g., due to differences in opinions about the fundamentals) and limits on
short sales. Our theory also has heterogeneous valuations, but in addition, it is explicit about
the search and bargaining frictions that are defining characteristics of OTC markets. It is also
consistent with the behavior of the illiquidity premia in response to variations in the measures
of liquidity documented by Ang et al. (2013); e.g., in the stationary monetary equilibrium the
expected financial return on the equity, (φst+1 + yt+1 )/φst , is decreasing with α.
    The theory we have developed also has sharp implications about how the effect of monetary
policy on asset prices depends on the microstructure of the market. For instance, it predicts that
the speculative premium, and therefore the typical residual mispricing term, should be larger
and more responsive to inflation in markets that are more liquid from an investor standpoint,
i.e., markets where investors are able to trade fast and face narrow spreads. In Lagos and Zhang
(2018), we provide related empirical evidence based on the differential effects of high-frequency
monetary shocks on the returns of stocks that differ in terms of their turnover rates.

be more than one stationary monetary equilibrium. Condition (13) is just (44), condition (15)
