        Estimates of growth equations have found a role for openness, particularly in explaining rapid

growth among East Asian countries. But major concerns of simultaneous causality between growth

and trade have been expressed,        This study aims to deal with the endogeneity of trade by using as

instrumental   variables the exogenous determinants from the gravity model of bilateral trade, such

as proximity   to trading partners.    We find that the effect of openness on growth is even stronger

when we correct for the endogeneity of openness than in standard OLS estimates. We conclude with

estimates   of how much has been contributed         to East Asian growth both by the exogenous      or

geographical component of openness and by the residual or policy component.

          The record of rapid growth that many East Asian countries have attained over the last

three decades is so spectacular that it has been claimed as supporting evidence by both sides in

each of three debates (at least), First is the debate on whether the East Asians’ success is proof

of the superiority of protectionist policies on the one hand, or of outward-oriented      policies on the

other.    Second is the broad debate whether the East Asian phenomenon       is evidence of the virtues

of government intervention in general, or of laissez-faire market-oriented      policies. 1 Third is the

debate over whether the statistics support growth based on simple accumulation          of the factors of

production (labor, education, and especially physical capital), or grow-th based on improvements

in technology and efficiency (measured as an increase in total factor productivity,       or the “SO1OW

residual’’).z Finally, in the latter case, there would also be the question whether this increase in

technical efficiency was due (i) to superior government policies, in which case East Asia may

have valuable lessons for other countries, (ii) to some superior mode of social organization,

perhaps    some exogenous     aspect   of Confucian   culture,   (iii) to simple     catch-up   with the

technologically   more advanced industrialized   countries,    or (iv) to chance.4


        ‘ Examples include Krueger (1990) vs. Pack and Westphal (1986), or the controversy
surrounding World Bank (1993), including Rodrik (1994a). Laissez-faire is not the same as
outward-orientation, of course, because some governments deliberately use subsidies or an
undervalued currency to promote outward orientation.

        2 Young (1992, 1994, 1994), Kim and Lau (1994), and Krugman (1994) have upset
conventional wisdom by arguing that growth among the four East Asian dragons, especially
Singapore, can be explained by simple factor accumulation, with no important residual left over
in most cases. Sarel (1995) reviews the state of play.

        1 This is the famous convergence hypothesis:          Barro (1991), Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1992), and Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992).

        4 Easter] y (1995) and Easter] y, Kremer, Pritchett, and Summers (1993),       The main
problem with the chance argument is that the East Asian success stories are all located in the
same region. These authors point out that this ex post reasoning has some pitfalls. Nevertheless,
this observed spatial correlation is a major motivation for the present paper.

          The subject of this paper is trade-led growth.      In measuring   trade, we lump together

exports and imports.          As emphasized   by Grossman    and Helpman       (1991 a,b) technological

spillovers could come via imports as easily as exports.

          Quite a few empirical studies of growth rates across countries find that the ratio of exports

to GDP, or some other measure of openness, is a significant determinant of growth5, and ofien

that it is an important determinant for East Asian countries in particular,b     A typical specification

begins with the standard determinants of GDP suggested by neoclassical growth theory, and adds

a variable for exports as a share of GDP. For example, Feder (1982) regresses growth rates for

31 semi-industrialized    countries over the period 1964-1973 against three variables: investment as

a share of income, the rate of growth of the labor force, and the rate of gro~h        of exports (times

exports    as a share of income).       The coefficient   on the last variable    is highly   significant

statistically.   Similarly,   Edwards (1993, pp,9-11) regresses the rate of growth of total factor

productivity     on two measures of openness -- total trade as a percent of GDP and total tariff

revenue as a per cent of trade -- along with some other variables,           and finds that “in every

regression the proxies for trade distortions and openness are highly significant. ”




        5 Examples include Michaely (1977), Krueger (1978), Feder (1982), Kohli and Singh
(1989), Romer (1989), Quah and Rauch (1990), de Melo and Robinson (1991), DeLong and
Summers (199 1), Dollar (1992), Edwards (1993a), van den Berg and Schmidt (1994), Sachs and
Warner (1995, p.35-37), Harrison (1995), and Eusufmi (1996). Edwards (1993b) and Rodrik
(1993) survey the literature.

          fi Five examples are Helliwell (1992, 1995), Page (1994), Pack and Page (1994), and
Fukuda and Toya (1995). Pack and Page find that manufactured exports, in particular, are
important in the growth equation, and that this variable explains part of the East Asian success
(and that its coefficient is the same as for other parts of the world). Bradford (1 994) surveys the
literature.

The Problem of Simultaneity        Between Trade and Growth

        Simultaneity is always a concern however,       Rodrik(1994b,    p.2), for example, argues that

the standard view is “quite misleading        on the importance    it attaches to the role of export-

orientation   in the growth performance.      It also has backward the causal relationship       between

exports, on the one hand, and investment and growth on the other. ” The mechanism              of reverse

causality that Rodrik has in mind runs as follows: an exogenous           increase in investment     in a

developing country with a comparative disadvantage in producing capital goods, such as Korea,

will necessitate an increase in imports of such goods (and in turn an increase in exports to pay

for the imports).’    Similarly,   Bradford   and Chakwin     (1993) argue that causality      runs from

investment to growth and exports, rather than the other way around.         Helpman (1988, p.6) asks

“Does growth drive trade, or is there a reverse link from trade to growth?”     Harrison (1 995, 9.26)

concludes that “existing literature is still unresolved on the issue of causality. ”

        Quite a few stories of reverse causality are possible.          When the equation features a

regression of GDP against exports (or the rates of change thereo~, the simultaneity           problem is

clear: a correlation may emerge simply because exports are a component             of GDP, rather than

because of any extra contribution that trade makes to growth.      In the case of imports, trade might

rise with income because foreign goods are superior goods in consumption.           Many studies have

sought to identify some direct measures of trade policv, hoping that they are exogenous.s            But,

aside from difficulties   in measuring     trade policies,   which are typically    serious    enough;    a




        7 Levine and Renelt (1992) reach similar conclusions.

       e Ben-David (1993) focuses on the formation of the European Economic                   Community
during the years 1959-1968 as an exogenous trade liberalization.
                                                     4

fundamental    conceptual problem of simultaneity         remains (e.g., Sala-i-Martin,    1991).     What if

free-market trade policies are no more important to growth than free-market domestic policies,

but tend to be correlated with them?           Then openness will be observed to be correlated with

growth, even though trade does not cause growth,              A final possible mechanism        is a pattern

whereby poor countries tend to depend fiscally on tariff revenue, and to reduce tariffs as they

become more developed.

        A number of studies have tangled with the challenge posed by simultaneity.                   Jung and

Marshall (1985), Hutchison and Singh (1987, 1992), and Bradford and Chakwin (1993) apply

Granger-causality      tests to the problem.     Esfahani    (1991) attempts    a simultaneous       equation

approach.    As so ofien in macro-econometrics,      however, the simultaneity problem has remained

largely intractable.

        What is needed are good instrumental        variables, which are truly exogenous,        and yet are

highly correlated      with trade,   This paper offers tests with such instruments:         trade shares as

predicted by the gravity model. The gravity model of bilateral trade, in its most basic form, says

that trade between country i and country j is proportional to the product of GDPi and GDPj, and

inversely related to the distance between them, by analogy to Newton’s theory of gravitational

attraction between two masses.       Other explanato~     variables often added include populations       (or

per capita GDPs), land areas, and dummy variables representing landlockedness,            common borders,

common      languages,    and common membership          in regional trading arrangements.          While the

gravity model has long been’ an ugly duckling of international economics -- obscure and allegedly

lacking theoretical foundations -- it has recently enjoyed a swan-like revival.           There are at least

three reasons for that revival: its empirical success at predicting bilateral trade flows, improved
                                                 5

theoretical foundations arising from modem theories of trade based on imperfect substitutes, and

a new interest among economists in geography and bade that seeks to treat countries or regions

as physically existing at particular locations in space rather than as disembodied     constructs.9

       Such variables as distances, populations, common borders, and common languages are as

close to exogenous as we get in economics.     From the viewpoint of a small individual country,

the GDPs of trading partners are exogenous as well.’” Yet these variables are highly correlated

with trade. Thus they make good instrumental variables,     An intuitive way to implement the idea

is to use the values predicted by the gravity model to instrument for the trade variable in the

growth equation.     If trade still appears to be a significant   determinant   of growth with this

correction (taking care, of course, to use the right standard errors), then we can conclude that the

effect is causal and not spurious,

       In the latter case, we might also be able to go on and say something               particularly

interesting for the East Asian countries: to the extent that there is a Solow residual in the growth

equation and it is associated with trade, how much of it can be explained by the proximity of the

East Asian countries to trading partners with rapid factor accumulation?        Is part of the growth

residual explained   by the trade share residual, i.e., to outward oriented policies,     or to other




         9 The results of one early gravi~ study were reported in Limeman (1967).             The
theoretical rationale for the idea that bilateral trade depends on the product of GDPs comes from
recent work by Helpman (1987) and Helpman and Krugman (1985, section 1.5). Frankel (1996)
elaborates, applies the gravity model to issues of trade blocs tests for trade blocs, and gives
ftiher references. Frankel (1993) and Frankel and Wei (1994) focus on East Asian blocs.

        ‘0 For a study like this one that seeks to explain growth for a cross-section of countries,
one does not wish to treat GDPs of trading partners as exogenous, even if the domestic country
is small. But if the standard factor-accumulation      terms in a growth regression (labor force
growth, investment, and education) can be treated as exogenous in the domestic country, then
they can also be considered exogenous in trading partners, as discussed below.
                                                         6

unknown factors, excluding proximity to rapidly growing trade partners?               Or, on the other hand,

to put it simply, is it just that they are lucky enough to be located near each other?

          Somewhat        relevant to this idea are tests in a number of recent papers.        DeLong and

Summers tested for spatial correlation of residuals in their growth regression, and (surprisedly and

surprisingly)      failed to find any correlation based on physical proximity.         Chua (1993), on the

other hand, finds “strong evidence for positive regional spillovers, accounting for about 14 to 18

per cent of a country’s growth rate. ” Elliott (1994) finds spatial correlation in growth, as well

as in the residuals           from a standard    growth regression,   particularly   among the East Asian

countries.      A correction for this spatial correlation, analogously to more common corrections for

serial correlation,      reveals higher standard errors than under usual OLS methods,          so that such

explanatory       variables      as education   and a dummy variable for Asian growth are no longer

statistically     significant.     As Chua (1993, p.31 ) notes, “The puzzle of the significant     continent

dummies         is solved.. .This result rules out the notion that the continent dummies        proxied for

intrinsic cultural differences         or political regime differences across continents. ” These papers,

however, do not focus specifically on trade.           They measure spatial proximity by simple dummy

variables for common border or common regions, rather than using the fill set of variables

known to be useful in the gravity literature,          As a result, the regional spillover effects found by

Chua and Elliott could be due to many possible channels, whereas ours can be specifically

identified with trade links. 11




         “ Weinhold (1995) has recently extended the approach of these papers, to focus on
differences in spatial dependence between industrialized and developing countries, making some
use of the gravity equation.. Moreno and Trehan (1996) argue that proximity matters for more
reasons than just trade.

The Growth Equation

         Here we adopt the “conditional convergence” specification            that has become common in

the empirical       literature    on growth,    While we consider       a number         of variants,   our basic

specification     is given by equation (1) below.           (See Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, 1992, for the

theory and testing of this equation, but without the opemess term.)              The dependent variable is

per capita GDP at the end of the sample, 1985. GDP per capita at the begiting                      of the sample

period   (1960)      appears     as an explanatory     variable.12   The other explanatory         variables   are

computed as averages over the sample periods, except for openness which is computed for 1985.

The possible endogeneity          of openness is the central focus of the paper,




log(Y/pop8j)      = ~ +

~ log(T/~i      + y log(lj~i     + b log(n), + $log(scH);     + A ~ogV@op60) +     u;.                         (1)




where,

Y is GDP;

pop is the country’s working-age          population    (results were little affected when total population

was used);

T/Y is total trade (exports plus imports with all countries, not just those in the sample, even

though these are a high percentage of world trade) as a share of GDP;

l/Y is gross investment as a share of GDP;



         12The hypothesis that countries are always in their Solow neoclassical growth steady-state
equilibrium would predict that lagged income has no effect. This seems unlikely, however, as
it should take countries a long time to converge to the long-run equilibrium.
                                                       8

n is the rate of growth         of pop,   plus an allowance      of .05 for technological    growth    plus

depreciation of the capital stock;

SCH is an estimate of human capital investment based on schooling.

We measure I/Y, n, and SCH as averages over the 1960-1985 period, but T/Y is for 1985 alone.

         Our sample contains 100 to 123 countries, depending on availability           of some variables,

Table    1 reports    incomes   for individual     East Asian countries,    and for the other countries

aggregated by geographical area. In the quarter-century         covered here, the East Asians went from

an average income per worker that was 20 percent lower than that of the average of non-OECD

countries, to a level 46 percent higher than theirs.’3          Their investment    shares and schooling

levels were not only higher than those of the other non-OECD              countries, but almost as high as

those of the OECD countries.          [Japan’s were higher than those of other Western countries.]

Certainly these factors are an important part of the East Asians’ success,           But might the trade

share of the East Asian countries, which in Table 4 is on average higher than that for any of the

other groups, also be part of the explanation?

         The first column of Table 2 reports the results of a conventional            OLS regression    on

Equation    1.   The estimated coefficient       on beginning-of-sample    GDP is .7, indicating   a 30%

tendency toward conditional convergence over the 25-year period. The coefficients on investment

and schooling are highly significant, while the coefficient on the rate of growth of the labor force

is not at all significant.   The coefficient on openness, the chief focus of our interest, is significant

at the 95 per cent level, Its point estimate suggests that for every 1 percent increase in trade as



         ‘3 In income per capita, they went from a level that was slightly lower than the others,
to a level more than twice as high.       In other words, a large increase in the labor force
participation rate was a major contributor to growth.
                                                     9

a share of GDP, income per capita increases by .15 percent,




The Gravitv Equation for Determining          Trade

         A standard gravjty equation for bilateral trade between countries i md j is of the form:




log (T~Y) = a + b] log(Y/Pop)       + bl log~/PopJ       + c1 log(Pop)       + c1 log(Pop~ +

                 d log(DistJ   + f(A~J   + g(LLJ   + h, log(AreaJ + hl log(Area) + eu.                    (2)




         Because the aim is to construct a measure of country i’s trade share that is exogenous,

there is a problem      in how to treat the incomes          ~. of the trading partners.       Ignoring   the

endogeneity    of ~ does not seem optimal.     In particular, if fitted values were constructed       based

on actual contemporaneous        values of trading       partner   income,    we might pick up spurious

correlation due to common growth factors or linkages other than trade.              One possible strategy is

estimating    a version of the equation that includes ~, with a coefficient constrained          to unity, 14

A second strategy is to drop trading partner incomes from the explanatory variables in the gravity

model.    This is not an entirely attractive solution either, because income is such an important

variable in the gravity model; but the outcome of such estimation of the growth equation using

purely “geographic” instrumental     variables is reported anyway in column 2 of Table 2. A third

strategy, our preferred one, is to substitute for ~ in the trade equation the fitted values of the

partner income levels, based on the factor terms, (l,~j, nj, and SCHJ.



        ‘4 Estimates such as many of those reported in Frankel (1996) support this constraint.
Cyrus (1996) allows for the endogeneity of income in estimates of the gravity model, by using
the factor accumulation variables as instruments.
                                                   10

        The predicted trade share for country i is the sum of the predicted bilateral trade shares

with all of its partners:




The sum is taken not just over the 63 countries for which we have bilateral trade data, but over

162 countries, virtually the entire world. (The growth regressions concentrate on a medium-sized

data set of 123 countries, however, because these are the ones for which we have the necessary

data on factor accumulation.      An Appendix table A-11 lists them.”)

        It is a good idea to inspect the first-stage regressions, to make arI assessment of the quality

of the instruments.    These are reported in Appendix Table A-4. In the full gravity model, the

correlation between the fitted trade shares and actual trade shares is quite high. When the trading

partners’ GDPs are excluded, but populations and areas are included, the fitted trade shares still

have a relatively high correlation with actual trade shares: 0.66.     The t-statistic in a regression

of the actual trade share on the fitted share is 9.5.

       In Frankel and Romer (1 995, Table 2), which reports the estimates of equation (2) in full,

it is argued that for use in the growth equation, we are only interested in exogenous components

of openness excluding       the size of the domestic country.   The argument     is that splitting   one

country into two independent      regions would raise the memured openness (trade/GDP)         of each,

even though it would at best leave unchanged the physical patterns of exchange of goods, and

would thus at best leave unchanged the growth rates of each.” (More likely, trade between the



        ‘5 China and Taiwan are included. (They were excluded from Frankel and Romer, 1995
[and from Table 2 of the January 1995 version of this paper], because we did not originally have
the schooling data for these two countries.)
                                                    11

two regions would fall, with an adverse affect on income per capita if the hypothesis is correct

that appropriately-measured     openness helps promote growth.)      Holding constant for the area and

population of the domestic country in a regression equation for actual openness, the t-statistic on

the fitted trade share falls to 3.5. (If size variables are excluded from the beginning, the t-statistic

on the “pure geography”        model of openness is only 3,2.)     Our preferred approach is to add

domestic and foreign per capita GDPs back into equation (2), but ordy in the form of the fitted

values of these variables in a conventional      growth equation, 16where the exogenous        variables

are investment,   population    growth, and schooling.    Under this approach, the t-statistic    on the

fitted trade share rises back to 6.6 [for the larger sample, and 4.8 for the smaller sample], even

when controlling for area and population,      In short, the geography and gravity models do supply

useful instruments   for openness.




        Table 4 reports for the East Asian countries the “predicted trade share”’7 alongside the

first column, which repeats these countries’       actual trade shares,    In the second column the

predicted trade share is computed using the pure geography approach, i.e., using only instrumental

variables such as distance.    In the third column, the predicted trade share includes also the effects

of trading partners’ factor accumulation,      Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,

Taiwan, and Thailand have actual trade shares in excess of the geographically           predicted trade



        ‘G E.g., Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992).

         ‘7 The predicted trade share is the fitted value in a regression of the actual trade share
against the constructed trade share, the latter calculated as the sum (over the trading partners
available in our data set) of the bilateral trade flows predicted from the geography equation. In
other words, the numbers that were estimated on a reduced sample have been “blown up” to
correspond to global trade.

share.   This might appear to suggest that deliberate outward-oriented         policies, or an absence of

the protectionist policies followed by the average of the 100 countries in the sample, contributed

to their relatively    high degree of openness.        The other countries    appear less open than the

geographical factors predict.     When the predicted trade share is constructed from the full gravity

model,     however,   only two East Asian countries           show an unpredictably    high trade share:

Singapore and Malaysia.        Only these two show strong evidence of outward-oriented           policies.

Evidently countries like Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong come by their high trade shares in large

part by virtue of the high rates of factor accumulation         on the part of their neighbors (including

each other).     The same is true for East Asia in the aggregate,’8




The Simultaneous-Equation          Estimates

         As explained above, two methods are used to construct the fitted trade share used in the

instrumental variables growth regressions in Table 2: the pure geography approach and the gravity

approach      with partners’   factor accumulations        used in place of their GDPs,      Under   both

approaches, the coefficient on the fitted trade share is statistically significant. 19 Indeed the point

estimate for the effect of openness is higher than it was in the OLS estimates,            For every one




          “ To give the reader an idea why specific East Asian countries score high or low on
predicted openness, the variables used in the geographical model, averaged for each country over
its trading partners, are reported in Table 7. (These are weighted averages, using actual bilateral
trade shares as weights.)


         19
             To allow for zero-values in bilateral trade data, we also tried using Tobit in the
regression to construct the openness instrumental variable, The point estimates and significance
levels are higher. [Those results are omitted here, but were reported in Table 2b of CIDER
Working Paper No. C95-050, U. C., Berkeley, also available as Pacific Basin Working Paper
Series No. 95-03, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, July 1995.]

percent increase in trade as a share of GDP, income per capita is higher by an estimated                .34

percent.     The predicted effect of going from a closed economy to one where imports and exports

sum to 200 percent of GDP (not as high as Hong Kong and Singapore), is to raise GDP by about

68 percent.20

           These results suggest our central finding: simultaneity     is not as serious a problem        in

appraising the effect of openness on growth as many have thought.         A Hausman specification test

fails to reject the hypothesis that the OLS and instrumental variables estimates are equal. To the

extent that simultaneity     is present, it seems to produce the opposite effect on the estimate from

what has previously been feared.




Implications     for Trade-Led Growth Among Ten East Asian Countries

           The next step is to examine individual       East Asian countries   (particularly    those with

positive TFP growth residuals), and so see how much of their growth can be explained by the

estimated effect of trade.     We expressed the dependent variable (1960-1985 growth in GDP per

capita) and the explanatory      variables as deviations from the non-OECD           world average.     The

explanatory     variables,   again, are: each country’s    openness,   investment,     population   growth,

schooling,    and initial (1960) income per capita.       Then we substituted        these values into the

estimated growth equation (the IV estimates) to see the role played by each factor in explaining




        20 We noted earlier an argument that one should condition on country size, as measured
by area and population, when observing the effects of openness on growth. In tests of this sort,
the standard error of the coefficient on openness is increased, so that its t-statistic falls to 1.7,
though the point estimate is little affected. (When initial income per capita is excluded from the
equation, openness remains statistically significant at the 95 percent level even when conditioning
on country size.) These results are reported in Frankel and Romer (1995), Table 5.
                                                  14

growth.     The results are reported in Table 5. We see that openness explains a large amount of

growth for Hong Kong and Singapore, and positive (though smaller) amounts also for Korea,

Malaysia, and Taiwan. In the Philippines, where growth was lower than the world average, a low

level of openness      explains almost half this gap,   Low opemess      detracted from the growth

accomplished     by China, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.    Of the other variables, investment and

schooling are the dominant determinants      in most of the countries.

          Almost all countries have a large positive unexplained   component, however, suggesting

room for one’s favorite stories about Confucianism, political stability, or government policy. The

exceptions are China, where catch-up from a low initial GDP explains most of the growth, and

Singapore.     As in the Young (1992) results, the residual for Singapore is very small (actually

substantially negative).   In our case, however, opemess, not factor accumulation,   is the dominant

explanation, apparently accounting for more of the growth miracle than investment and schooling

combined.     The Philippines is the other country, besides Singapore and China, where the residual

is negative; but this is a matter of a partially unexplained poor growth performance,    not a fully-

explained good perforrnance.2]

          If openness was an important contributor to growth in many of these countries, was this

the result of the accidents of geography      and history, or might it have been the outcome of

deliberate policies?    Table 6 ftiher   breaks down the openness effect from Table 5.22 In most




        2’ The results are slightly different in the case of the pure geography instruments,
reported in Table A-6. Opemess explains a little less of growth in Hong Kong, Singapore and
other countries, as compared to the case where output determinants are included among the
regressors.   But the explanato~ power of openness is still large and significant.

          22 Appendix Tables A-7 and A-8 for the smaller sample.
                                                       15

cases, the contribution of openness to growth is a contribution of trade as predicted by the gravity

model; thus it camot be attributed to policies.        We see that for Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan,

the helpful effect of openness is fully predicted by the gravity model, leaving nothing as a

residual.     For Singapore and Malaysia, on the other hand, the contribution of predicted openness

is smaller than the contribution of residual openness, presumably attributable to outward-oriented

policies.     In some of the cases where a level of openness less than the global average held back

growth, a low level of residual openness was a more important component than was predicted

openness.       This describes China, Japan, the Philippines     and Thailand.23




            To summarize the results briefly, many of the explanations offered for East Asian growth

indeed appear to play an important           role: simple catch-up (particularly    China, Indonesia,    and

Thailand), investment and education (especially Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan),

and an unknown          residual   (especially   Japan, which has a large positive       residual,   and the

Philippines, where growth was much lower than one would predict).             Openness plays a substantial

role in many countries, especially Hong Kong and Singapore.

            Several extensions of the research are desirable.     In the results reported here, we do not

constrain the coefficients c, g, and h to be the same for country 1 and country J, e.g.,             g] = g2,

even though the dependent variable is the sum of both directions of trade,              Eventually   we will

estimate a gravity equation for imports separatelyfiom          exports; at that time it will be appropriate



        23 Again, the results are somewhat different when the instruments are restricted to
geography variables.   Now Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan join Malaysia and Singapore, as
countries where residual openness makes a larger contribution to growth than does predicted
openness.   But it seems likely that this residual openness is in part due to the rapid factor
accumulation of neighbors, rather than to outward-oriented policies.
                                                 16

to allow the coefficients on domestic and foreign variables to differ.      Among other advantages,

such an equation might allow us to distinguish        whether the spillover effects from neighbors’

growth come via exports, as traditionally    assumed, or imports, as might be implied by some

recent theory such as Grossman-Helpman       (1991a, 199 lb).24        Another possible extension   for

future research would be to attempt explicit tests that distinguish the importance of rapid growth

among close trading partners from other determinants       of trade.

       Our current conclusion, however, is that the role played by opemess in promoting growth

turns out to stand up well to the simultaneity   charges that have been leveled against it.




        24 Coe and Helpman (1993) test the theory, and find that TFP is affected not only by
domestic R & D, but also by R & D of those countries from whom the domestic country imports
a lot.

Note: The dependent variable is log GDP per worker in 1985. Averages are for the period 1960 to 1985.
Inv is the average share of investment in GDP. Pop Growth is the average powth in the working-age
population (plus 0.05, as in Mardc.iw-Romer-Weil, to account for tihnological progress and depreciation).
School is the average secondary school enrollment ratio. In the IV regressions, predicted openness from
the bilateral trade equations is used as an instrument for actual openness. Standard emrs are reported in
parentheses.

Note: The dependent variable is ln(Ti/GDPi) in 1985. Population indicates the working-age population
in 1985. In the IV regression, fitted GDP per capita from a Mankiw-Romer-Weil-style factor-
accumulation regression is used as an instrument for actual GDP per capita. The “smaller sample”
includes the countries in Frankel-Romer plus China and Taiwan. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.

Note: The dependent variable is log GDP per worker in 1985. Averages are for the period 1960 to 1985.
Inv is the average share of investment in GDP. Pop Growth is the average growth in the working-age
population (plus 0.05, as in Mankiw-Romer-Weil, to account for technological progress and depreciation).
School is the average secondary school enrollment ratio. In the IV regressions, predicted openness from
the bilateral trade equations is used as an instrument for actual openness. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses.
