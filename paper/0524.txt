                 The Role of Money Supply Shocks in the
                       Short-Run Demand for Money

                                   ABSTRACT


     Previous models of the demand for money are either inconsistent with

contemporaneous adjustment of the price level to expected changes in the

nominal money supply or imply implausible fluctuations in interest rates

in response to unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. This paper

proposes a shock-absorber model of money demand in which money supply

shocks affect the synchronization of purchases and sales of assets and so

engender a temporary desire to hold more or less money than would other-

wise be the case. Expected changes in nominal money do not cause fluctua-

tions in real money inventories. The model is simultaneously estimated for

the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,

and the Netherlands using the postwar quarterly data set and instruments

used in the Mark III International Transmission Model. The shock-absorber

variables significantly improve the estimated short-run money demand func-

tions in every case.

    Existing models of the demand for money are either inconsistent with

contemporaneous adjustment of the price level to expected changes in the
                                            fluctuations in interest rates in
nominal money supply or imply implausible

response to unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. This paper pro-
                                 model of money demand which has neither of
poses and tests a shock-absorber
                                                  superior empirically for the
these defects. The shock-absorber model proved

eight industrial countries used in our tests.

     A critical review of the main alternative models is presented in Section
                                            in Section II. Section III dis-
I. Our shock-absorber model is outlined

                       I.   Alternative Adjustment Models

     Partial adjustment models are almost universally adopted in analysis

of money demand applied to quarterly data. This is so because the effect

of changes in real income and interest rates appear to be much smaller in

the first quarter than in the long-run)

    The usual approach was proposed by Chow (1966) who argued that a change

in the determinants of the long-run demand for money would lead to a change

in real money balances in the current quarter which is a fraction of the

difference real long-run money demand and lagged real money balances.       In


logarithmic form this is:

                                                                        (1)
          mt-mti=A(mt-mti)
where mt is the logarithm of real money balances in period t and m is the

logarithm of the long—run desired quantity in period t.2 The short-run de-

mand for money is therefore

                                                                        (2)
          mt=Xm+(1_X)mti
That is, short-run money demand is a (geometric) average of the long-run

desired quantity and lagged real money.

    Although conceived for analysis of changes in the long-run desired

quantity of real money, the model also works well for expected changes in

the nominal money supply. A number of recent articles3 have demonstrated

that expected changes in the nominal money supply are neutral in the sense

that the price level and other nominal variables move proportionately while

real variables are unaffected.4 Thus neither m nor mt_i will change due

to an expected change in the nominal money supply, and real money will be

unchanged since

                                                                        (3)

                                                                        3




where Mt and       are the logarithms of the nominal money supply and price

level, respectively, and Mt and Pt increase equally. Thus the Chow model

is consistent with contemporaneous changes in expected nominal money and

the price level.

        The Chow model does not seem to work so well in the case of nominal

money supply shocks.5 If M is the expected logarithm of the nominal money

supply, the money supply shock or innovation is defined as

            MtMt_M*t
Money supply shocks do not have the neutral properties of expected changes.

Recent empirical research can be summarized as showing that a money supply

shock will have relatively little contemporaneous effect on the price level

but will instead increase real income and reduce interest rates via the

liquidity effect. But if the impact effect on       of    is no more than say

0.1, then the impact effect on m must be at least           That is an unex-

pected increase (decrease) in the nominal money supply of 1 percent would

be associated with an increase (decrease) in real money of at least 0.9 per-

cent. To stay on the short-run money demand function (2), long-run desired

balances must increase by 0.9/A percent, and estimated values of A rarely

exceed 0.1 for quarterly data. To achieve even a 9 percent change in

requires implausible changes in real income and interest rates.

    We can illustrate this by reference to a simple Cagan (1956) long-run

money demand function:


            mta0+ct1 ,t+a2 Rt                                           (5)

where      is the logarithm of real income, and Rt the nominal interest rate.

Differentiating (5) we obtain

Using a short-term interest rate for Rt estimates of        and c2Rt (the       in-


come and interest elasticities of m) are typically about 1 and -0.1 respec-

tively.7 Finally, assuming that the first-quarter income effect is no njore than

1," we can solve for the interest rate impact necessary to achieve a
                                                                          —
                                                                          dm of       9.

                                                                          dtt
This is


           Rt
                    dMt
An 80 percent decrease in the interest rate in response to a 1 percent unex-

pected increase in money strikes us as an implausibly large first quarter

liquidity effect.9

      In summary, the Chow model works well with respect to chançies in the deter-

minants of long-run money demand or expected changes in the nominal money

supply.    It is unsatisfactory as an explanation of short-run money demand in

quarters in which money supply shocks occur.

       In two   influential papers, Goldfeld has proposed that the partial adjust-
ment model be applied to nominal money balances instead of real money balances:'°
                                                                               (7)
      Mt_Mt     i=X(M_Mt1)
This formulation is less satisfactory than the Chow formulation in the case
of money supply shocks since it can be shown1' that it requires

            dm1           •1        dP4.
                                                                               (8)

                t                   dM
                                         t       dP
which is larger than the corresponding value -(l- —-)      for   the Chow form.
                                                     dMt
Further the Goldfeld form has a peculiar nonneutrality with respect to ex-

pected changes in the nominal money supply: Equation (7) can be solved as

                                                                               (9)
            mt=Xm+(1X)mt,(1A)(Pt-Pt1)
                                                                       5




Thus the Goldfeld model is identical to the Chow formulation except for the
addition of the term -(l-x)(Pt_Pti). This deduction of —(1—A) times the quar-
terly   inflation rate is in addition to any effects operating via the interest

rate     and implies that people will never catch on to an expected inflation

when it comes to adjusting their cash holdings. Thus the Goldfelcl approach

seems less satisfactory than the Chow approach on two counts.

                        II. The Shock-Absorber Model

     One of the authors (Darby, 1972) has previously proposed that money bal-

ances serve as a shock absorber or buffer stock which temporarily absorbs

unexpected variations in income (transitory income) until the portfolio of

securities and consumers' durable goods can be conveniently adjusted. A

similar response would seem reasonable for the portfolio shock engendered by

unexpected changes in the nominal money supply. If the Fed increases the

nominal money supply by an open market operation, the initial impact on the

price of Treasury bills will quickly spread to the prices of other securities.

In the process, individual investors will find that they cannot obtain their

expected yield from their planned portfolio and will take some time to choose

an alternative portfolio, incidentally holding larger average balances. Others

will find that they sell assets --   stocks,   houses, cars --   quicker   than ex-

pected at their reservation price and have larger average balances. Credit

availability will be greater also, and loans will be approved more quickly and

more frequently with temporary increases in money balances. Of course for

each individual the temporary increases may be brief, but as the changes are

quite general the aggregate effect can be large. The process can be reversed

for unexpected decreases in the nominal money supply, with unexpectedly low

asset prices, slow sales, and restricted credit availability causing individ-

uals to temporarily dip into their cash reserves.

     In summary, money supply shocks will affect the synchronization of purchases

and sales of assets and so engender a temporary desire to hold more or less

money than would otherwise be the case.12 This indeed is one of the basic func-

tions of money, much discussed in undergraduate classes, but not previously
                                                                      7




included in aggregate demand functions. Whether this effect is important is

an empirical question to be examined in Section III.

     Our discussion suggests two modifications to the basic Chow mechanism:

 (1) addition of a transitory income term and (2) addition of a money supply

shock term. The shock-absorber version of the Chow mechanism is thus:

                                                                      (10)


 where y is logarithmic transitory income (y1
                                                 '-    y where y is the
 logarithm of real permanent income).'3 Our preferred long-run money demand

 function is


                                                                      (11)

Combining (10) and (11) we get the estimating equation

                                                                        (12)

The reduced form differs from that of equations (2) and (5) only in allowing

for different effects of the permanent and transitory components of real in-

come and in the addition of the money supply shock term.

Under the Chow model, f=O while under our alternative hypothesis          If

equation (11) is the true long-run money demand function, then 1=0 under the

Chow hypothesis and >0under the shock absorber model. But in fact the true

long-run money demand function might weight transitory income anywhere between

O [equation (li)j and the weight of permanent income [equation (5)]. So the

Chow hypothesis is 0<zxy. and the shock absorber hypothesis is 0<. A

which falls in the overlapping region O<<Ay1 does not distinguish between the

two hypotheses.

     Before going on to the empirical estimates, we should note another, pos-

sibly complementary reason why money supply shocks might enter the short-run

money demand function. Suppose, following Barro and Santomero (1972) and
                                                                      8



Klein (1974), that the long-run money demand function should include both the

short-term interest rate Rt and the implicit yield on the bank deposit portion

of money, R1. Because banks pay interest on deposits in hidden ways for legal

reasons, R' is not observable. However there is anecdotal evidence that the

implicit rate is sticky in the sense of being slow to adjust to changes in

If we consider R as an omitted variable and apply standard specification analy-

sis,15 the coefficient of Mt would have an expectedvalue equal to its own

value plus the product of the coefficient of R1 and the coefficient of it in

the auxiliary regression of R on the variables included in the estimated money

demand function. Now if a positive money shock causes Rt to drop relative to

R, the auxiliary-regression coefficient will be positive as is the coefficient

of R. So positive weight may be given to      as a proxy for R in addition to

any effect due to a pure shock-absorber effect.
                                                                          9



                               III. Empirical Tests

     In this section we estimate the shock-absorber money demand equation

(12) and test (a) whether the coefficient of transitory income differs sig-

nificantly from both 0 and the coefficient of permanent income and especially

(b) whether the coefficient of the money supply shock is significantly greater

than zero. This raises two major econometric difficulties: simultaneity bias

and estimation of the money supply shock M.

     Simultaneity bias arises because y, R, y, and           are all determined

simultaneously with mt and so are likely correlated with the stochastic dis-

turbance in (12).    In particular, to the extent that the monetary authority

is passive in its monetary policy a positive value of the real money demand

disturbance will induce an unexpected increase in the nominal money supply.

This would induce a positive bias in the coefficient of Mt if equation (12)

were estimated by ordinary least squares. Similarly transitory income may

be affected by the stochastic disturbance in (12) as well as by the money

shock which could result in additional bias to both coefficients. To avoid

this sort of bias, we must use a simultaneous equation method in the context

of a model in which the simultaneously determined variables are endogenous.

The Mark III International Transmission Model developed as part of the NBER-

NSF Project on the International Transmission of Inflation fits the bill

nicely and permits us to test the equation for eight major countries.6

     In the Mark III model ,   the   expected logarithm of the nominal money supply

(that is, M) is based on a univariate ARIMA process. This definition was

found to work better (in terms of fit, coefficients, and autocorrelation of

residuals) in the behavioral equations of the model than alternative formula-

tions based on transfer functions including all lagged variables in the central

bank's money supply reaction function. A rationalization of this apparent

limitation   on the information set would involve costs of acquiring and proces-

sing information.17 We did check that the results do not change substantially
                                                                      10




from those reported below when the transfer function definition of M is
       18
used        David Laidler (1979) used Barro's definition of M in a new compara-

tive study of money demand functions also with similar results.'9

       Table 1 presents instrumental variable estimates of equation (12) for

the eight countries in the Mark III model (the United States, United Kingdom,

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands). All estimates

are for the entire period 19571-19761V for which all required variables are

available in the NBER International Transmission Data Bank. Permanent income

is estimated using the method in Darby (1974) with a current quarter weight

of 0.025.20 The instruments used are the (approximately 25) principal com-

ponents for each country which span the predetermined domestic variables

and fitted foreign variables in the country's submodel. For comparison,

Table 2 presents OLS estimates of the equations which are virtually identical

except that the estimated coefficients of        do appear to be biased upward to

an extent in the OLS estimates.

       Examining the results in Table 1, we see that the money shock variable

enters consistently as predicted by the shock absorber model with a coeffi-

cient between 0.6 and 1.2. The coefficient of transitory income is not very

precisely estimated and exceeds that of permanent income in only three

cases --    significantly   so only for the United States. Perhaps this

reflects the greater movements in U.S. transitory income in the sample

period. Alternatively, the Darby (1972) estimates of a very strong transi-

tory income effect on money demand may have been due to spurious correlation

with the there-omitted money supply shock. As a whole these results are

consistent with the shock-absorber model of equation (12), particularly as

to the importance of including the money-supply shock term. Figure 1 compares

the actual values of mt with the fitted values based on the Table 1 regressions

for benefit of eyeball econometricians.
                                                                       11




    A problem with these results, as with most if not all applications of

the Chow model, is that positive autocorrelation in the residuals biases

the estimated value of A toward zero. Using Durbin's h to test for such

autocorrelation in the presence of a lagged dependent variable, we find

significant and positive autocorrelation for all countries except the United

States, the United Kingdom, and Canada (which is nearly sionificantly neqative).

We would like to correct for this autocorrelation to confirm that this does

not affect the results.   In principle, a generalization of Fair's (1970)

method for first-order autocorrelation in simultaneous equation systems

could be used. But the TROLL system uses an inconsistent method of combining

instrumental variables and generalized least squares (GLS) methods which

apparently heightens the bias of A toward 0 without any appreciable effect

on the estimates or t-values of the Mt coefficient. Table 3 reports instead

straight GLS estimates for which there is some upward bias on the Mt coef-

ficients.    The estimated coefficients of   are little chanqed. Apparently

the near-orthogonality of the money-shock variable to the other explanatory

variables makes it little affected by bias due to autocorrelation of the

residuals.

     We note that we have only an imperfect measure of the division of

nominal money into its anticipated and unanticipated components. Thus, our

Mt variable is measured with error and this would generally2' bias downward

its estimated coefficient. Whether this bias is greater or less than the

upward simultaneous—equation bias which we detected is impossible to say.
                                                                       12




                        IV.   Sumary   and Conclusions

     We have argued that money supply shocks cause unexpected variations in

yields, asset prices, and credit availability which induce a temporary sympa-

thetic movement in the short-run demand for money. Failure to allow for such

movement requires very large movement in prices, real income, and interest

rates as compared to typical reduced form estimates. We find that a simple

amendment to the popular Chow short-run money demand function produces a shock

absorber model which works well in explaining short-run money demand for eight

industrial countries. We believe that inclusion of such a variable in the

money demand equation of a modern macroeconometric model is necessary to
                                          22
obtain reasonable price level behavior.

    A policy implication of our shock-absorber model is that money-supply

shocks will induce smaller interest rate fluctuations than implied by the

Fed's model so that policymakers need have less concern over interest rate

implications of a monetary policy couched in terms of monetary aggregates.

     *The authors wish to acknowledge helpful comments from Phillip Cagan,

Edgar Feige, Michael Hamburger, Benjamin Klein, David Laidler, Richard Roll,

Ernest Tanner, Alan Walters, an anonymous referee, and participants in money

workshops at the Ohio State University and UCLA. Michael T. Melvin and

Andrew A. Vogel provided able research assistance. Darby's research was

supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation, Scaife

Family Trusts, Alex C. Walker Foundation and Reim Foundation., This is not

     1An alternative explanation would attribute this phenomenon to money de-

mand being a function of permanent income and permanent interest rates; see

Feige (1967) and Laidler (1977, pp. 142-48). However lagged adjustment still

appears to be present when permanent income is used as an income variable.

     2lhere should also be a term for normal planned growth, but this is de

facto captured in empirical estimates by the constant in the function explain-

ing m.

     3Most notably Lucas (1973), Sargent and Wallace (1975), and Barro (1977,

1978).


     4We are abstracting here from possible effects on interest rates from

changes in the expected growth rate of the nominal money supply. See Darby

(1979, pp. 134-138, 207-213) for a discussion of real effects in the non-

superneutral case.

     5As early as 1967, Alan Walters observed that the aggregate nominal

money supply was fixed by the central bank and that the Chow model could be

interpreted as a model of price adjustment to nominal money supply changes.
                                                                                   22




Artis arid Lewis (1976), Lewis (1978), and Jonson (1976) also considered

money demand functions in the context of adjustment to changes in the

aggregate nominal money supply. Quite understandably, these authors did

not see the importance of distinguishing between expected money supply

changes and money supply shocks.

     6Barro's (1978) equation (9) indicates an impact effect of            on Pt of

0.26, but this is for annual data. Estimates of the first-quarter effect are

much smaller.                          I




     7The estimated values of A, a1, and a2Rt do vary somewhat in the literature,

but this is much less true for             and AcL2Rt on which the liquidity effect cal-

culated below depends. For example, a high estimate of A will be offset

empirically by a low estimated

quarter value of —-- was 0.33. Barro's value of 1.04 (1978, equation 3) was
                          dMt
obtained for annual data which thus includes lagged as well as impact effects.


     9See Cagan and Gandolfi (1969) and Gibson (1970) for estimates of the

liquidity effect.

     '3in Darby (1972), transitory income was measured as real dollars per

annum rather than as a fraction of permanent income as here. The earlier

measure was more natural for the shock-absorber effect but required a linear

money demand function and iterative estimation techniques. The present ver-

sion should serve nearly as well but the coefficients should be divided by

the mean income velocity for comparison with the 1972 estimates.


     14See for example Barro and Santomero's discussion (1972, p. 399) of

the infrequency of change in service charge remission rates.


     '5See Theil (1971, pp. 549-550).

     '6See Darby and Stockman (1979).


     17See Darby (1976) and Feige and Pearce (1976).

     '9We may perhaps be forgiven for noting that our formulation won Laidler's

  race hands down.


               amounts to a real interest rate of 10 percent per annum, compounded

  quarterly.

     21But not necessarily in a multiple regression context.

     Barro (1978, pp. 568-571) relied instead on the transitory income aspect

  of the shock-absorber model to obtain consistent price level behavior. But

  we saw that this is relatively unimportant compared to the money shock effect.
