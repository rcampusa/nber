                Are Devaluations Contractionary?


                              AB ST PACT




         Recently a number of authors have criticized the role of devaluations

in traditional stabilization programs. It has been argued that, contrary to

the traditional view, devaluations are contractionary, and generate a decline

in aggregate output. In spite of the renewed theoretical interest in the

possible contractionary effects of devaluations, the empirical evidence on the

subject has been quite sketchy. In this paper the Khan and Knight (1981)

model is extended to empirically address the issue of contractionary

devaluations. The extended model considers the effect of money surprises,

fiscal factors, terms of trade changes and devaluations on the level of real

output. The results obtained, using a variance components procedure on data

for 12 developing countries, provide some support to the short—run contrac—

tionary devaluation hypothesis; the results obtained indicate that in the

short run a devaluation will generate a decline in aggregate output. It is

also found that after one year a devaluation will have an expansionary effect

on output. The evidence suggests that in the long run, devaluations will have

no effect on output.

 I.   Introduction

          Devaluations are usually an important component of orthodox

 stabilization programs. 1/ According to the traditional theory it is expected

 that a devaluation will result in expenditure switching, increased production

 of tradables, higher exports, and in an improvement of the external position

of the country in question. 2/ Recently, however, traditional stabilization

packages, and especially their devaluation component, have come under attack

by a number of authors. Even though some of the reservations regarding the

role of devaluations as a stabilization policy tool are not new -— and date

back, at least, to the elasticity pessimism controversy -•-   they have
encountered new acceptance among some economists and policymakers. 3/

          The main thrust of this new critique to devaluation has been subsumed

under the term contractionary   devaluation.   There are several theoretical

reasons why, contrary to the traditional view, a devaluation can be contrac—

tioriary, and generate a decline in real activity. First, a devaluation will

result in a higher price level, generating a negative real balance (or Pigou)

effect. This, in turn, will result in lower aggregate demand and output. '4/

Second, a devaluation can generate a redistribution of income from groups with

a low marginal propensity to save to groups with a high marginal propensity to

save, resulting in a decline in aggregate demand and output. (See, for

example, Diaz—Alejandro, 1965. See also Krugman and Taylor, 1978.) Third, if

the price elasticities of imports and exports are sufficiently low, the trade

balance expressed in domestic currency may worsen, generating a recessionary

effect. And fourth, in addition to these demand-related effects, there are a
                                       -2-



 number of supply-side channels through which devaluations can be contrac-

 tionary, For example, van Wijnbergen (1985) has recently developed a model

 with intermediate goods and informal (curb) financial markets where under

 certain conditions a devaluation can result In an upward (recessionary) shift

 of the aggregate supply. 5/

          In spite of the renewed theoretical interest on the possible

 contractionary effects of devaluations, the empirical analysis has been some-

 what sketchy. Gylfason and Schmidt (1983), for example, have constructed a

 small macro model with intermediate goods, where devaluations have two

 conflicting effects: On one hand they generate an expansion
                                                               through aggregate
demand; on the other hand, a devaluation results, through its effect on the

cost of imported intermediate inputs, in an upward shift in the aggregate

supply schedule. They then establish the conditions required for the

contractionary effect to dominate. The implications of the model are analyzed

by imputing plausible values to the corresponding parameters for a group of

five developed countries and five developing countries.   With the exceptions
of the U.K. and Brazil these results suggest that, as postulated by the

traditional theory, devaluations have a positive effect on aggregate output.

         Connolly (1983) considered a group of 22 countries and regressed the

change in the rate of real growth on the change in the nominal exchange

rate. The coefficient obtained was positive and marginally significant,

providing some support to the hypothesis of expansionary devaluations.

However, as Connolly himself acknowledges, his results are subject to a

selectivity bias, since typically countries that devalue do so after having

entered into a recession. Gylfasori and Risager (1984) developed a model for a

small country, which stresses the effects of devaluations on interest payments
                                        -3-




  on the foreign debt. Using imputed parameter data Gylfasori and Risager

  suggest that while devaluations are generally expansionary in
                                                                  developed
  countries, in developing countries they are likely to be contractionary.

          Other authors have constructed country—specific simulation models to

 analyze, among other things, the effectiveness of devaluations as

 stabilization policy tools. Branson (1985), for example, has recently

 constructed a small simulation model for Kenya to investigate these issues.

 His results suggest that, contrary to the traditional view, a devaluation will

 have important contractionary effects in the Kenyan economy. Lance Taylor and

 Jeffrey Rosensweig (19814), on the other hand, built a fairly large computable

 general equilibrium model for Thailand, and simulated the effects of a number

 of policy measures, including a devaluation, on the Thai economy. Their

 results suggest that a devaluation of the baht of 10 percent will have an

 expansionary effect and will generate an increase in real GDP of 3.3 percent.

          Other studies have discussed the output effects of devaluations in a

less formal way. Cooper (1971a), in his well-known study, analyzed 214

devaluations that took place between 1953 and 1966. After looking at the

behavior of the principal components of aggregate demand he concluded that

'tdevaluat.iori itself often initially tends to depress economic activity in the

devaluing country, contrary to what has normally been expected" (p. 5014).

Krueger (1978) analyzed output behavior during the periods surrounding major

devaluation episodes in the countries considered in the NBER project on trade

liberalization. She found that in most cases devaluations had been associated

with expansions in the level of real activity. 6/ Edwards (1985) investigated

the effects of 30 major devaluations in 22 developing countries. He found

that in only 14 out of the 30 cases the level of real GD? declined after the
                                           —)4 —




  devaluation.    L-{owever, when rates of growth of real GDP were considered, a

  slightly   different   picture emerged; it was found that in the period

  immediately following the devaluation the rate of real growth dropped in 10

 out of 30 cases. In sum, then, the existing evidence
                                                           regarding the effect of
 devaluations on real economic activity is mixed; while some studies suggest

 that devaluations have an expansionary effect, others indicate that they

 generate a contraction in the economy.

             Most studies that have investigated the effects of devaluations on

 economic activity suffer from at least one of the two following

 shortcomings: First, they use a "before" and "after" approach where they

 compare the performance of the economy around the devaluation period, without

 taking into account the behavior of other variables like
                                                             monetary policy,
 fiscal policy, and external disturbances. Second, in order to investigate the

 effects of devaluations on growth and output, they perform "indirect" tests,

 using simulation models with imputed parameter values obtained from other

studies. The purpose of the present paper is to empirically analyze the

contractionary devaluation issue using a procedure that is not subject to the

above mentioned criticisms. In particular, in this paper the approach taken

by Khan and Knight (1981) is extended to investigate the effect of

devaluations on real output growth. The paper is organized in the following

form. In Section II the model being tested is briefly presented. In Section

III the results obtained using annual data on 12 developing countries f or

1965-80 are   reported   and discussed. Finally, in Section IV the main points of

the paper are summarized and some directions for future research are

suggested.

 IL   The Model

          In their recent analysis of the effects of stabilization programs on

 aggregate production in developing countries Khan and Knight (1981) argued

 that the level of economic activity In these countries will be affected by a

 number of variables, including the existing disequilibrium in the money

 market, and the level of fiscal expenditure. In the present paper, the Khan

 and Knight (1981) formulation is modified in various respects.       First, in

 accordance with the recent rational expectations literature their excess money

 supply term is replaced by a money surprise or unexpected money growth

 term. 7/ Second, the possible role of terms of trade changes on the level of

activity are explicitly incorporated into the picture. And third, an exchange

rate term is added into the regression analysis to explicitly investigate the

effect of devaluations on real aggregate output.

         An essential element in the traditional view of devaluations is the

assumption that nominal devaluations generate an improvement in the domestic

relative price of tradables to nontradables. That is, it is assumed that

nominal devaluations result in real devaluations. It is indeed this relative

price change that, according to this view, generates the process of

expenditure-switching, balance-of-payments improvement and economic

expansion. In this paper this assumption is not challenged and, as some of

the existing evidence suggests, it is assumed that this is indeed the

case. 8/ Consequently, the exchange rate term incorporated into the real

output, reduced-form equation is a real   exchange   rate index. 9/

         The modified, reduced-form equation for real output considered in

this paper is:

 where y Is aggregate real output. Parameter I captures the trend rate of

 growth of real output; (GE/Y) is the ratio of government expenditure to

 nominal income; A log M is the actual rate of growth of nominal

 money, A log Me is the expected rate of growth of nominal money, and it is

 assumed that expectations are formed rationally and conditional on all

 available information. CA log M - A log Me] then, is the unexpected rate of

 growth of money. On the other hand, t           is    the terms of trade, defined as the

ratio of export prices to import prices. e is the real exchange rate defined

as the relative price of tradables to nontradables. 10/ An increase in e, then,

represents a real devaluation. Finally c is an error term.                   Equation (1) can
in fact be considered as an open economy extension of the equation estimated

by Barro (1978) in his influential paper on the role of monetary policy in the

U.S.

         In the estimation of (1) it Is expected that 8i>O. To the extent

that the rational expectations approach is correct 82 will also be positive.

The terms of trade coefficient (83) is also expected to be positive. 11/

The    coefficient captures the effect of (real) devaluations on real output

growth and is the primary interest of this study. If devaluations are

contractionary, as suggested by the neo—structurallst critique, 8 will be

significantly negative, indicating that, with other things given, a (real)

devaluation will result in a decline in aggregate real output. On the other

hand if, as indicated by the more traditional approach, devaluations are

expansionary the estimated value of          would be positive, it should be noted,
                                             —7—



 however, that since this is a reduced—form equation the
                                                                  8 coefficient will    be
 picking    up the total effect of devaluations on growth1 without allowing us to

 establish whether there are indeed conflicting forces (i.e.,
                                                                       contractionary
 and expansionary) as suggested by some models.

             In equation (1) only contemporaneous values of the independent

 variables have been included. In the estimation, however, and in order to

 analyze whether there are differences between short- and
                                                                   long-term effects,
 lagged values were also introduced. For        the   case of the real exchange rate

 the inclusion of lagged values is important since some authors have argued

 that the contractionary effects of devaluations will be a short-run phenomenon

 [i.e., Cooper (1971a)].



 III. Results

            Equation (1) was   estimated   using a variance-components procedure on
data for 12 developing countries for 1965-80. The countries included are:

India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Greece, Israel, Brazil,

Colombia, El Salvador, South Africa and Yugoslavia. These countries were
chosen   because of data availability: They were the only developing countries
that   had long enough time series for all the variables of interest. All of

these countries      have experienced important real exchange rate changes (i.e.,

real devaluations and appreciations) during the period under consideration,

and all but El Salvador had also
                                      gone through episodes of major nominal
devaluations. For the exact definition and sources         of   the data, see the
Appendix.

            Before   estimating the real output equation (1) it is necessary to

find adequate time series for the money surprises term [Mog M -          log   Me].
                                           —8—




 In   this paper, as in a number of other studies on the subject, this unexpected

 money growth term was constructed,     for   each individual country, as the

 difference between actual money growth and      the   estimated rate of growth of

 money obtained ff'om a money creation equation. 12/ In principle, the equation

 used to generate the expected rate of growth of money should include variables

 that indeed convey information to the different economic agents about the

 central bank behavior. In a number of developing countries money creation is

an important source of fiscal deficit financing [Edwards (1983)]. For this

reason, in the money creation equations used in this study the ratio of the

fiscal deficit to lagged high-powered money was used as an explanatory

variable. Additionally lagged values of           log M were also included in this

equation.

            For each individual country, then, the following money creation

equation was estimated:


            slog   Mt= a0+a1Alog M 1+a2log M 2a log M3+aDEH+1J,                      (2)

where Mt is broadly defined 042) nominal money, DEH is the fiscal deficit
term and      is a white noise term. The results obtained from the estimation

of (2) for the twelve countries considered in this study for 1963-80 are

reported in Table 1. As can be seen in all cases the fits are         quite   good. In
ten of the twelve cases the coefficients of the fiscal deficit term DEHt are

positive as expected. However, in only four cases -- Greece, Israel, Brazil

arid Colombia --   this   coefficient is significant at conventional levels. For

all the countries the F-statistics indicate that        these regressions do provide
important information about the money creation process. In all cases the
residuals were closely examined in order to make sure that they were white
                                            —9—




  noise, and consequently qualified as proxies for money surprises in the

  estimation of the growth equation (2). Notice that while tIe output equation

 was estimated for 1965—80, the money creation equations were estimated for

  1963-80. This was done in order to allow for the inclusion
                                                                       of lagged money
 surprises in the real output growth equation.

          Equations equivalent to (2) were also estimated for alternative

 definitions of nominal liquidity (high—powered money, domestic credit and

 Ml). Surprises series obtained as residuals of these equations were also used

 in the estimation of the real output equations.
                                                            Broadly speaking, the results
 obtained under these alternative definitions of
                                                           unexpected liquidity growth
 were very similar to those reported here. 13/

          The following output equation was actually estimated, where n=1,...12

 refers to the twelve countries and where t=1965, ..., 1980:


           log          I time +
                                   81lo(GE/Y)
                        2
                      + Z        log M —    log Me]
                       1=0 •)1                        n,


                      Z831log Tfl,_1+o B1log e,_1+ v+ C

         This    equation differs from (2) by the inclusion of lagged values of

the money surprises, the terms of trade and the real exchange rate terms. In

this way the possibility of a different short- and long—run effect of these

variables on real output is allowed. If, for example, devaluations only have

a temporary contractionary effect          will be significantly negative with the
coefficient of the lagged value of e being zero or positive. 1'4/ Notice also

that in the estimation of equation (3) the I coefficient was allowed to differ

across countries.

         The results obtained from the estimation of the B coefficients in

equation (3), and of some of its variants, are presented in Table 2. On the

other hand, the country—specific l's obtained in each of these cases are given

in Table 3. First, regarding Table 2, as expected, the coefficients of the

money surprises are positive. Moreover, lagged money surprises turned out to

be significantly positive. This result suggests that, according to the

implications of the rational expectations hypothesis, unanticipated money

growth has had a significant effect on these developing countries' level of

real activity. Moreover, when the money surprises terms were replaced by the

actual rate of growth of money the resulting coefficients were small and

insignificant, confirming the idea that money surprises only affect real

activity in these countries.

         As can be seen from Table 2, the coefficient of (GE/Y) was

significantly positive in all equations where it was included, indicating that

with other things given, higher government consumption has a positive impact

on output. Regarding the coefficients of t the results show that according to

previous findings [Barro (1978), Edwards (1983)], changes in the terms of

trade have no perceptive effect on real output in the developing countries. 15/

         In equations (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and (3,14) a contemporaneous and a

lagged real exchange rate term were included. The results obtained are quite

Interesting. In all cases the coefficient of the contemporaneous real

exchange rate term are negative as suggested by the coritractiortary devaluation

view; moreover, in all cases this coefficient turned out to be significantly

different from zero at conventional levels (5 percent and/or 10 percent).

Interestingly enough, the coefficient of the once lagged real exchange rate

term is positive and in all cases it Is significantly different from zero at

the 5 percent level.

             These results provide statistical support to the view that in tne
 short run   devaluations   have a contractionary effect on aggregate output. That

 is,   they support the short-run version of the contractionary devaluation
 hypothesis.    Also, these   findings indicate    that this short-run contractionary
 effect   is later reversed, with after one year the devaluation having an

 expansionary influence on output. 16/ Moreover, according to these results the

 contemporaneous   and lagged effects of the (real) devaluation cancel
 themselves.    Indeed a formal   test on the equality (with opposite sign) of
 these   two coefficients indicates that the null hypothesis of equality cannot

be rejected. This means that in the long run         in   these countries (real)

devaluations have had no effect on output. 17/

            The equations presented in Table 2 were also estimated with the rate

of change of the real exchange rate instead of log e as an independent
variable. The results obtained basically confirmed those reported in Table          2;
in    most cases the coefficient of the contemporaneous devaluation term was
negative. The coefficient of the one-year lagged real devaluation was
positive   and in a number of the regressions significant at the conventional

levels. These results, as well as the data set, are available from the author

upon request.

           A potential problem with the results reported in Table 2 is that the

real exchange rate (RER) may not be a completely exogenous variable. In fact,

it has been argued by a number     of   authors that higher growth will generally

result in a real appreciation of the domestic currency (Balassa 1964). In

order to take this potential simultaneity problem into account, equation (3)

was   also estimated using a two—stages least squares variance Component
procedure. The results obtained fully confirmed the conclusions that emerged

         To sum up, the evidence presented here is quite favorable to the

contractionary devaluation hypothesis. It indicates that once other important

variables are accounted f or, (real) devaluations have a significantly negative

effect on real output in the short run. The regression results also indicate

that in the longer run devaluations have an expansionary effect on output, as

the traditional view suggests. The results reported here have been obtained

using a real exchange rate index as the relevant exchange rate variable.

However, equation (3) was also run replacing e by the nominal exchange rate.

In that case in all regressions the coefficients of the nominal exchange rate

variable were not significantly different from zero. This, of course, is not

surprising since, as discussed, most modern theories of nominal devaluation

recognize that for a devaluation to have an effect on real activity, it has to

generate a change in relative prices.
                                          —16—



          It is important to remember     that   the results reported here were

 obtained using annual data. It is possible that If quarterly data were used a

 richer pattern of dynamic response of     output growth to   real devaluations would
 be found. 19/


IV. Concluding Remarks
          In this paper the effect of (real) exchange rate changes on real
output growth have been analyzed using annual data for a group of twelve
developing countries during 1965-80. Specifically this paper tried to provide
some empirical      content to the recent controversy on whether devaluations are

contractionary or expansionary. The empirical analysis was        based on the
estimation   of a   reduced-form, real-output equation that included as RHS
variables money growth surprises, government expenditure, terms of trade and
real exchange rates. The results were quite favorable to the short-run
contractionary   devaluations hypothesis. After one year, however, the evidence

suggests that real devaluations do have an expansionary effect on output

growth. In the long run devaluations will have no effect on output. Since

the analysis was done using annual data it is not possible to investigate what

the intra-year dynamic effects of devaluations on output are.

 1/ Most IMF     stabilization     programs, for example, rely heavily on
      deval uat I ons.


 2/ See, for example, the account of the effect of a devaluation in any

      traditional   textbook Strictly speaking a nominal devaluation will result
      in higher output only if there is unutilized capacity. If this is not the
      case, the nominal devaluation will be translated into an equiproportiona3.
     increase in prices, and the real exchange rate will not change. On this
     see Johnson (1976). In this paper, however, we concentrate on the case
     where nominal devaluations are       actually   translated into real devaluations.

3/ See, for example, Taylor (1983), Katseli (1983) and Buffie (198i4). See

     also Hanson (1983).

                          perhaps, the real balance effect is also a

     of the monetary approach to devaluations. See Frenkel and Johnson (1976).
5/   See also Gylfason and Schmidt (1983). It should be noted that most

     theoretical models on contractionary devaluations have used a framework

     without    capital accumulation or growth.
6/ Also the numerous studies that have investigated the effects of IMF
     stabilization       programs on output have looked at real activity behavior

     before and after major devaluations. See,for example, the discussion in

     Gylfason    (1983).
7/   On the effect of money surprises      on:output   in developing countries see,

     for example, Hanson (1980). Clements and         Jonson   (1979), however, have
     shownthat under certain circumstances the excess supply term used by Khan
     and Knight is equivalent to using money surprises.

 8/ On empirical analyses of nominal devaluations and        real    devaluations see,

     for example, Krueger (1978) and Edwards     (1985).
 9/ The importance of real devaluations in the adjustment process is stressed

     in most modern analyses of the subject. See, for example, Dornbusch

     (1980). Obviously if a nominal devaluation results in an equiproportjonaj.

     increase in the price of nontradables, the real exchange rate will not

     change, and there will be no effect on production or expenditure. In

     fact, according to Johnson (1976), if output is at its full employment

     level a nominal devaluation will affect prices in an equiproportionate

    way, without altering the real exchange rate or outputs. The evidence

    presented in Cooper (1971a,b), Krueger (1978) and Edwards (1985), among

    others, indicates that in most major nominal devaluations the real

    exchange rate has also been devalued. The analysis was also performed

    using the nominal exchange rate in equation (2). See the discussion

    below.

10/ It is important to emphasize that both from an analytical and empirical

    perspective, e and t   are different variables. This point is stressed by
    WillIamson (1983) and   Katseli   (i984).

11/ See, for example, Barro (1979) and Edwards (1983).

12/ See, for example, Barro (1977), Hanson (1980) and Edwards (1983). Barro

    (1977) disOusses the assumptions implicit in the use of residuals as

    proxies for money growth surprises,

13/ These results are available from the author on request.

1/ t'Iote that some authors [i.e., McCallum (1980)J have argued that in a

    rational expectations setting only contemporaneous surprises should be

    included in the output growth equation. Barro (1977), however, has argued

    in favor of incorporating lagged values of    Ut   anticipated   money.

15/ Equation (i4) was also estimated using the rate of change of the terms of

    trade instead of their level. No siificant changes in the results .ere

    obtained.

16/ These results       correspond    exactly to what Cooper (197th) suggested almost

    fifteen years ago.

17/ When additional lags of RER were incorporated, their coefficient was

   nonsignificant.

18/ The following instruments were used: All the exogenous variables in (3.1)

    plus twice-lagged money surprises, terms of trade, real exchange rate; and

   contemporary, lagged and twice—lagged changes in domestic credit.

19/ This suggests that further studies on the effects of devaluations on real

   activity   coul ri    c')ncer1tr e :)fl   how parti cular sectors (1 .e., manufacturing

   sector   and so      on), f or   which there are quarterly data, react to (real)
   exchange rate        changes. In    some sense, however, this is not a very

   satisfactory    way to     proceed,   since even if    devaluations   have an overall
   expansionary effect, they          will result in output reduction in some     sectors.

      Ctp ):        Was   defined as real GD?, and the data were taken from line
          99b.p of the IFS.
 Nominal Money (M): A     broad definition (M2) of money   was   used. Average yearly
          values constructed from data obtained from IFS were used.

Fiscal Deficit: Data from line 80 of IFS were used.

Terms of Trade: Defined as the relative price of exports to imports; taken

         from the IFS supplement on international trade statistics.

Real Exchange Rate: Defined as the relative price of tradables to

         nontradables. This variable was proxiect by a real exchange rate

         index constructed as the nominal exchange rate with respect to the

         US. dollar times the ratio of the U.S. WPI index to the domestic CPI

         index. A number of authors have recently adopted this index as the

         best proxy for the relative price of tradables to nontradables. In

         the present paper on the real exchange rate, indexes were also used

         as possible proxies for this relative price. The results, however,

         were not affected.

Government Expenditure: Defined as government current       expenditure and taken
        from   line 91f of the IFS.
