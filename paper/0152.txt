 1. Introduction



      A renewed interest in the theory of optimal taxation has emerged in

 recent years. The theory of optimal taxation generally has followed two

 disparate paths: the theory of optimal commodity (or indirect) taxation

 and the theory of optimal income (or direct) taxation.   Only occasionally
 have attempts been made to integrate or compare these two approaches. While

 each has an interesting history In economics, much important work is of

 recent origin and, I shall argue below, much remains to be done if we are

 to use optimal tax theory as a guide to the formulation of tax policy.

      The major achievement of the theories of optimal income and commodity

 taxation is the derivation, under a series of well—specified assumptions,

 of rules which the tax system must follow if it is to maximize (alternative

 representation of) social welfare. Not surprisingly, these rules provide

 formulae for optimal rates of tax on different commodities or different

levels of income which are functions of several key parameters in economics:

price (and Income) elasticities of demand, the wage elasticity of labor sup-

ply, and the interest elasticity of saving, among others.

     It is thus obvious that estimates of these parameters play a crucial

role in both the analysis and potential implementation of optimal tax

theory. First, such estimates are necessary inputs in the provision of

numerical examples of the optimal tax formulae. The range of estimates

actually employed in analytical studies of optimal taxation is quite wide.

Second, the incorporation of optimal tax theory into actual tax policy de-

pends upon rather precise and stable estimates of these parameters. While

we may write interesting papers detailing the optimal tax rates for several

alternative plausible parameter values, the fiscal authorities, of course,

must develop and implement a unique set of rates. While the rates can,

do, and should change occasionally, we would hardly endear ourselves to

either taxpayers or tax collectors if we proposed changing the rate with

each new empirical study appearing, say, in Econometrica!

     Fortunately, a renewed interest in obtaining Improved econometric esti-

mates of these parameters has occurred simultaneously with the renewed theo—

retical Interest in optimal tax rules. The availability of new data, the

development of new estimation methods and a renewed interest in the prac-

tical policy implications of the theoretical propositions of optimal tax

theory have produced new and substantially improved econometric estimates

of some of the most important determinants of optimal tax rates. Combined

with some of the more robust propositions of optimal tax theory, this new

and improved econometric evidence has important implications for tax policy.

     The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the issue

of the implications of optimal tax theory and recent econometric evidence

for tax policy. Toward this end, Section 2 provides a brief and often
                                    3



heuristic suary of the major results of optimal tax theory. I discuss

the famous Ramsey Rule and inverse elasticity formula for optimal commodity

taxation. I also discuss the application of this analysis to the question

of the desirability of a consumption rather than an income tax. Finally,

I present the implications of the analysis of optimal direct taxation.

These analyses highlight the importance of labor supply and saving elasti-

cities.

     Section 3 reports the results of some recent econometric studies of

saving and labor supply. Particular attention is paid to relating the

econometric evidence to the theoretical constructs of the optimal tax

models. For example, I discuss in detail the problem in going from esti-

mates of the relation between hours of work and net wage rates to the con-

cept appropriate for the optimal tax problem: the wage elasticity of labor

supply in the envelope sense, subsuming effort and human investment. I

also discuss recent attempts to analyze tax disincentives to saving. In

reporting a brief suary of recent econometric evidence, I must, of

course, exercise my (subjective) evaluation of sometimes conflicting studies.

I shall also take the liberty of relying upon my comparative advantage and

draw heavily upon my own work.

    Finally, Section 4 outlines the implications of the combined theory

and econometric evidence for tax policy. My conclusion is that on the one

hand considerable progress has been made on several basic issues; these

include the choice between consumption and income as the basis for direct

taxation; the desirability of eliminating the practice of income splitting

and using different rate schedules for primary and secondary earners in
                                    4




the family; and the desirability of avoiding extremely high, marginal tax

rates on highly productive groups making up a significant fraction of the

labor force.

     On the other hand, much work remains to be done before optimal tax

theory can serve as anything more than a very rough general guide to tax

policy. First, additional theoretical work to examine the robustness of

the results to alternative specifications is desirable. Second, consider-

ably more econometric evidence is necessary before we have enough confidence

in the precision and stability of the estimates of the relevant parameters

to progress beyond several broad generalization to a more precise specifi-

cation of the tax structure.

 2. The Theory of Optimal Taxation



     The debate over desirable properties of taxes no doubt commenced

when the first (probably implicit) taxes were levied; in any event, it

continues unabated to this day. We are all familiar with Adam Smith's

four canons of taxation and their modern counterparts, such as horizon-

tal equity, ability to pay, equal sacrifice, etc. The more rigorous and

precise analysis of taxation starts with Dupuit [1854] and Edgeworth [1897],

includes important contributions by Ramsey [1927], Pigou [1947], Hotelling [1937]

Boiteux [1956] and Harberger [1964] and is currently reemerging in the work of a

whole generation of public financiers. The utlitarian approach to which

I refer has been applied to a wide variety of problems, both in an out

of public finance. Its unifying theme is the study of how to achieve

certain goals (raising revenues, for instance) via public policies (e.g.,

taxes) in such a way as to maximize, or at least improve, src±al welfare

(which in turn depends upon the welfare of individuals) subject to a model

of the economy (e.g., the behavior of consumers).

     This approach to public finance problems has been applied to such

diverse issues as the desirability of housing subsidies (Atkinson and

Stiglitz [1976]), public utility pricing (Mohring [1973]), congestion

tolls (Marchand [1971]), optimal indirect taxation (Diamond and Mirrlees [1971]),

and tax expenditures (Feldstein [1975]). A series of recent papers attempt

to relax some of the more restrictive assumptions of the theory, although

generallyat the expense of considerably complicating the optimal tax rules.

Useful surveys of the area may be found in Sandmo [1976] and Atkinson and

Stiglitz [1972]; an interesting history of the development of this line of

thought may be found in Baumol and Bradford [1970].
                                       6



        My purpose here is to present a brief heuristic introduction to the

area and to discuss the applications of the theory to three basic concerns

of tax policy: the choice between income and consumption as a tax base,

the tax treatment of the family, and the desirability of highly progres-

sive income tax rate schedules.

        Let us start by imagining the simplest possible economy: consumers

have Identical preferences and endowments so distributional consideration

may be ignored, and we may proceed as if we have one consumer. The con-

sumer's preferences are represented by a utility function of the usual

sort,



             U =
                   U(Xi,...X)                                        (1)




where Xi,...,X are the n goods produced and consumed in this economy.

For convenience, we take Xi to be leisure. Taking leisure as numéraire,

the   government seeks to collect a given amount, say T, in taxes. Hence,



                         T                                           (2)
             i2 t1X1 =



where t            the tax rate on commodity i. We shall further assume that

producer prices are fixed (the assumption of constant returns to scale is

all that is necessary). Thus           is the difference between consumer prices

p and producer prices q1.
        The problem for the fiscal authorities is to maxImize (1) subject to

(2). The first order conditions are
                                          7



                   au     ax +            ax +
             1E1   --:j               1        X,) = 0                (3)




                                          k =   2,.. .,n

Substituting from the individual's first—order conditions for utility

maximization (U =               for all 1) and from the budget constraint, we
                          XP1
have




Using the Slutsky equation and the symmetry of pure substitution effects,

we have



             i2 tiski)
                          = + i2                     k =   2,.. ,n
                                                               .




where I is exogenous income)

       This equation yields the famous Ramsey rule: the proportionate reduc-

tion in compensated demand should be equal for all commodities (the right—

hand side is independent of k)!

       As Sandmo [1976] and others have noted, this result is a particularly

vivid contrast to the common, but incorrect, supposition that an equi—pro—

portionate change in all prices (e.g., uniform commodity taxation) is

desirable.



   fuller derivation may be found in Sandmo [1976] or Atkinson and Stiglitz
   [1972].
                                      8



    A heuristic, but more direct, derivation of the equal proportionate

reduction in demand rule which I have found useful in teaching undergrad-

uates (and which I owe to Eytan Sheshinski) starts with the usual partial

equilibrium formula for the deadweight loss associated with a tax induced

price distortion:



            DWL =                     V I                          (6)
                    4 t1AX1


It is clear that efficiency requires that the (I suppress marginal) dead-

weight loss per dollar of tax revenue be equal for all commodities, i.e.,


            tI x
                                      Vi,                (7a)
            ti xi


i.e.,                                                              (7)




                                                         (7b)
            xi


        In general, of course, the structure of optimal taxes depends upon

the entire set of own and cross price elasticities of demand. In a model

in which we allowed for many goods (including goods at. different times and

locations), the informational requirements for implementing such formulae

are prohibitive (see Hahn [1973]). Fortunately, in practice tax rates

are generally levied by commodity groups. Such aggregation sharply dimin-

ishes the econometric information required (i.e., we are allowed certain

separability restrictions). Further, for several interesting problems,
                                     9



we can reduce our search to information on a very small number of key para-

meters.

     Consider, for example, the issue of the desirability of uniform taxa-

tion of commodities. When is uniform taxation by a uniform VAT (or consump-

tion tax) preferable to differential excise taxation? First, if labor is

in completely inelastic supply (perfectly inelastic demand for leisure),2

it is optimal to tax only labor. In a world where only efficiency matters,

there is no deadweight loss caused by a tax on a commodity in perfectly in-

elastic demand. The same change in relative prices (between leisure and all

other commodities; the relative prices of consumer goods remaining unchanged)

may be obtained with uniform commodity taxation.3

     Hence, in this special case, the optimal structure of taxes on all

commodities is found in the estimation of just a labor supply function (which

proved to be perfectly inelastic).

     More generally, the optimal tax rates are related to demand elastici-

ties. Indeed, when cross—elasticities are negligible,4 the set of equations

(5) reduces to




                                                                 (8)
          Pi C

2The issue is whether the untaxed commodity (or commodities) are in complete-
  ly inelastic demand. Since leisure — or rather time spent outside the
  market, including work in the home — is in practice by far the rnot impor—
  tant such commodity, we focus on labor supply in the discussion.
3The same result obtains when utility is separable between leisure and other
   goods and preferences for consumer goods are hornothetic.

4This proposition is sometimes claimed to demonstrate that when all cross—
   elasticities are zero, commodities should be taxed in inverse proportion
   to their demand elasticities. Of course, if all cross elasticities are
   zero, all own elasticities must be unity and uniform taxation is optimal.
                                     10



where C     is   the own price elasticity of demand. Thus, when we can safely

ignore cross—elasticities, commodities should be taxed inversely to their

demand elasticities.5 Other things constant, it is inefficient to tax

heavily goods with large demand elasticities.

    The foregoing may be applied to the choice between income and consump-

tion taxation. While many other features of both each of the taxes and the

economy affect such a decision, a major concern is the relative elasticities

of labor supply and saving. If labor is In completely inelastic supply, It

is optimal to tax labor income only (as noted above). Thus, a pure    con-

sumption tax Is optimal in this case.6 If consumption is unaffected by

Income (or interest income) taxation, it is optimal to tax only capital in-

come (If sufficient revenue can be raised). If both labor and capital are

in perfectly inelastic supply, any combination of labor and capital income

taxes is optimal.

     In the more realistic case of some elasticity of both factor supplies,

the optimal tax structure is a mix of taxes on capital and labor income,

with a higher tax rate on the factor with the lower supply elasticity.7

Hence, once again, the implications of optimal tax theory for this impor-

tant Issue of tax policy depends upon (econometric) estimates of labor sup-

ply and consumption functions!



5Since many commodities with low estimated demand elasticities are consumed
   disproportionately by the poor, this rule illustrates the efficiency—
   equity tradeoff. Sandmo [1976] discusses approaches to this problem in
   more detail.

6Actually, all that is required for a tax only on labor income to be optimal
   Is that utility be separable between leisure (at each point In time)
   and consumption.

7Peldstein [1977] presents a thorough analysis of this problem.
                                    11



     As a special case of the analysis discussed above, consider the

problem of how to tax families in which there are two potential earners

(e.g., a husband and wife). The family's utility depends upon the con-

sumption of goods and the leisure of each potential worker:



          U =
                U(C,L,L.) .                                         (9)


The government seeks to raise a given revenue and can tax the earnings of

the husband and the wife. Under what conditions should it tax them at the

same rate (e.g., as occurs under the income splitting provision, or joint

return schedule, available in many countries)? Indeed, should the govern-

ment attempt to tax the leisure of one of the earners via a wage subsidy,

while taxing the labor supply (via an earnings or payroll tax) of the other?

I have elsewhere (Boskin [1973]) analyzed this problem in detail.

     The point here is that the solution depends upon the own and cross

substitution effects on the labor supply of husbands and wives.

     Thus, once again, the optimal tax framework reveals that the answer

to a central issue of tax policy depends heavily upon estimates of own and

cross wage elasticities of labor supply (of husbands and wives).

     While the tradeoff between efficiency and equity can be explored in the

optimal indirect tax context (see Atkinson and Stiglitz [1976]), we shall

not do so here. We turn instead to the analysis of optimal direct taxation.

Since it is feasible via direct taxation to levy taxes on individuals or

families at different rates, such taxes are a major potential Instrument

of redistribution policy.
                                   12



         The earliest rigorous analysis of optimal direct taxation was

that of Edgeworth. He argued that if all individuals have identical declin-

ing marginal utility of income functions, the maximization of the sum of

utilities (his measure of social welfare) required equalization of income!

Of course, this analysis ignores the potential disincentives to supply

labor and save created by extremely high tax rates. Incredibly, the optimal

tax problem was not analyzed with the utilitarian approach incorporating

disincentive effects until quite recently. Starting with a remarkable

paper by Nirrlees [19711, a series of papers has analyzed the income tax

rate structure which maximizes social welfare subject to a government revenue

requirement, a skill distribution, individual preferences for income and

leisure (more generally producing Income versus not producing income, e.g.,

supplying labor, saving, educational investment, etc.), and production pos-

sibilities. Mirrlees' surprising result is that for a utilitarian social

welfare function (the sum of utilities), a Pareto or log normal skill distri—

bution, and elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure of unity

(i.e., a very elastic labor supply), the optimal tax rates are quite low

and actually decline over some income ranges; rather little redistribution

is optimal under Mirrlees' specification.

     A variety of authors have extended Mlrrlees' analysis to consider al-

ternative social welfare functions, the endogeneity of wage rates, and al-

ternative skill distributions and labor supply elasticities. In general,

the optimal marginal tax rates, on different income classes, depend upon

the social welfare function, ability or productivity, the density of the

group in the population, and the elasticity of labor supply.8 Stern [1976]



8See Stern [1976] for a survey of some of the more Important papers.
                                     13



has demonstrated the crucial role of labor supply elasticities. The larger

is the elasticity of labor supply, the lower the optimal tax rate. Further,

since the models are generally atemporal, they may be reinterpreted as

applying to an entire lifetime. Hence, the sensitivity of saving and human

investment to taxes also are important. The larger are the tax disincentives

to produce income in the market (via hours of work effort, human investment

and saving), the lower are the optimal tax rates; and if these elasticities

vary in the population, ceteris paribus, the rates should be higher in those

income groups with the lower elasticities.

     The generic optimal income tax problem may be analyzed as follows

(I owe some of these points to Partha Das Gupta): individuals differ in

"ability" which we index by 8; g(O) is the probability density of 0, I.e.,

Ig(0)dO = 1.   Utility depends upon consumption of goods and leisure:



           U = U(C8,
                        )                                          (10)


where C0 and    are consumption and labor supply (negative leisure) of

someone with ability 0. Income depends upon ability and labor supply:



     Y = y(O,   Lo)
                      with y > 0                                   (11)

                            y > 0.


     The government cannot observe ability 8, and hence cannot tax it; It

only observes Income, a compound of ability and labor supply. Thus, it

imposes a (for expository purposes only) linear negative income tax with

credit   and marginal tax rate 8. Hence,
                                          14



                  =                                                      (12)
                      BJY(O. L0)g(O)dO.


Hence, the budget constraint for an individual with ability level e is




             Ce        y0, £) + —     By(O, Le).                         (13)




Individual maximization of (10) subject to (12) yields



              *   =     *
             Ce        C0(cz, 8)
                                                                         (14)
                  =
                       9(ct,   8).




In choosing a and B, the government seeks      to   maximize social welfare

subject to (12) and the behavior of individuals defined by (14). We may

represent this social welfare function as



                                                                         (15)
             JG(U0(C, 2)g(O)dO.


Characteristics of the solution include the implication that the more

elastic is the supply of labor, the lower are a and 8, i.e., the larger

is the wage elasticity of labor supply, the less progression is socially

desirable.

     Since the analysis of optimal indirect taxation revealed that the

smaller the wage elasticity of labor supply, the less desirable is capital

income taxation, an interesting paradox occurs: a conflict is created,

via the wage elasticity of labor supply, between increasing progression
                                    15



and the taxation of capital income! If the wage elasticity of labor supply

is small, substantial progression can be justified, but in a consumption

tax, not an Income tax! If the wage elasticity of labor supply Is large,

taxes on Interest income are desirable, and hence income taxation tends to

be preferable to consumption taxation, but the amount of progression which

Is socially desirable Is severely limited!

     Our story Is by now familiar: the rigorous analysis in the optimal

tax theory framework of another important Issue of tax policy focuses

attention on econometric studies of labor supply and saving. To these

we now turn.

3. Empirical Evidence



    Now that we have established that (estimates of) labor supply (leisure

demand) and consumption (saving) elasticities are central concerns in ap-

plying optimal tax theory to tax policy, we must examine what is known

empirically about these parameters.9

     I shall argue that we have made considerable progress in recent years

in understanding both labor supply and consumption behavior.      While we have

not yet precisely pinned down the relevant elasticities so as to permit

exact calculations of optimal tax formulae, I do believe some extremely

important general tendencies have been well documented and they do have

certain useful policy implications.

     The notion that private saving is unaffected by taxes has received

widespread acceptance among empirical and policy—oriented macroeconOmists

in the United States (see, e.g., Okun (19751). This inference is virtually

always based on evidence which is flimsy at best and dangerously mislead-

ing at worst —   the relative constancy of the gross private saving rate in

years of relatively full employment in the United States. While neither

the numerator nor the demoninator of this ratio measure the economically

                                                                  is attached to
correct concepts very well, a strong behavioral significance

this reduced form relation. The best attempt to rationalize this relation-

 ship (usually termed "Denison's Law") —    which to my knowledge has never been

 observed for any other economy —   is   that of David and Scadding (1974].



   shall confine myself to estimates for the United States, both because

     In a thought provoking reexamination of "Denison's Law," they docu-

ment the continued constancy of the gross private saving rate, the con-

stancy of the saving rate augmented to include consumer durables purchases

in saving and the rental flow from durables in income, and changes in the

composition of private saving between the household and business sectors.

They interpret this relative constancy of the gross private saving rate

as evidence that taxes —   either   through a reduction in private income or

a reduction In the real net rate of return on capital — do not affect

private saving behavior. While this argument also has been made by a large

number of other economists, we shall demonstrate below that drawing such

behavioral inferences from these data is not warranted. The argument they

use to rationalize "Denison's Law" is that taxes and present consumption

are essentially perfect substitutes; the rise in taxes is offset by an

equivalent decline in current consumption. They go on to explore a variety

of intriguing conjectures concerning consumer behavior.

     Three basic points need to be made concerning this conjecture. First,

most theories of consumer behavior relate saving to disposable income. If

this is correct, the saving rate varies substantially.

     Second, it indeed would be surprising if consumers made this type of

rational calculation vis a vis the government and business sectors in terms

of gross saving and income. Consumers' capital depreciates. Again, our

economic theories generally relate to how consumers choose their net posi-

tion. Further, except for some possible embodied technical change, it
                                       18



is net saving that is relevant to the issue of whether taxes affect capital

accumulation. The net private saving rate —     net   saving divided by net in-

come —   exhibits   substantially more relative variation than the gross series

and can hardly be called constant, even if we confine ourselves to the

postwar period.'0 While depreciation series are notoriously unreliable,

use of several alternative series based on tax, replacement cost, etc. de-

preciation still yields substantial variation in the net private saving rate.

I take this to be a strong indictment of the structural interpretation of

ttDenisont s

      Third, even If total gross income and gross saving are examined, there

still may be an independent effect of real net rates of return on saving.

Even If taxes and present consumption are perfect substitutes (the public

sector is doing Its benefit—cost analyses properly, free rider issues are

ignored, etc.), the share of private wealth consumed today (publically or

privately) will depend upon the net, or after—tax return to saving, whereas

gross income is the flow from private wealth at the gross return. Hence,

taxes decreasing the net return to saving may cause a decrease in saving.

      Before proceeding to a variety of estimates of saving equations, it is

perhaps worthwhile to offer a brief conjecture on the apparent constancy of

the saving rate. Consider two motives f or saving: smoothing of consumption

over the life—cycle and bequests. Further, assume bequests (broadly con-

strued to include provision of education as well as pure financial bequests)

are luxuries. Hence real income growth would tend to increase saving.



If we took the broader view of saving as inclusive of human investment,
    use of Kendrick's [19761 data reveals still more variability in the
    total saving rate, gross as well as net.
                                    19



However, if saving is also positively related to the real net return on

capital, the slight decline in this rate would lead to a decrease in saving.

Hence, the two effects offset one another. No doubt many other effects

have been at work as well. Thus, I find it extremely difficult to give

any structural or behavioral Interpretation to the constancy of the gross

private saving rate.

     Merely pointing out some difficulties in interpretation of some data

does not suffice to reject the conjecture outright; nor does it provide an

alternative behavioral interpretation. Hence, we turn now to estimates of

the effect of taxes on private saving, i.e., to estimates of consumption.

functions.

     Until quite recently, empirical studies of the effects of (tax—induced)

variations in the real after—tax rate of return on private saving were few

and far between. Break [1974] notes "Unfortunately, empirical evidence on

the interest elasticity of the saving rate is rare." Most such studies

conclude that interest rates have only a negligible effect on consumption or

saving. Musgrave and Musgrave [1974] report that "Studies of the relation-

ship between saving and the rate of return differ in their conclusion. Some

hold that there is a substantial negative relationship, while others attri-

bute little weight to the rate of interest in the consumption function."

    Feldstejn [1970] has demonstrated that studies which use the nominal

(and/or before—tax) rate of return when the real (net) rate is appropriate

almost certainly bias the estimated elasticity downwards by a substantial

amount. While economic theory points to the real net of tax   rate   of return

as the price determining the consumption—saving decision (with, perhaps an
                                                 20




independent effect of inflation), I know of only two studies which attempt
                                                                                               0
to examine the sensitivity of consumption or saving to real net rates of

return and, hence, to the interest rate effects of income taxation.

    Wright [1969] includes a measure of the return on stocks and bonds in

estimating consumption functions from U.S. annual time series data. His

estimates imply an Interest elasticity of 0.2. This is substantially larger

than the zero elasticity of "Denison's Law"! However, Wright's measure of

consumption and income suffer from several deficiencies, his data refer to

the period through 1958 only, and he estimates his equations in a manner

which does not allow for the endogeneity of the rate of return.

     I have reexamined U.S. aggregate time series data in Boskin [1977].

Using improved data on consumption, income and wealth, I have estimated

consumption functions for several alternative sub—periods, definitions

of the key variables, functional forms, and estimation methods. My pre-

ferred estimate is as follows:



          LGCONSP = —5.83      + 0.55 LGDPI + 0.32 LGDPI(—l) + 0.72 LGWLTH(—l)
                         (1.55) (0.13)       (0.23)           (0.03)

                         —   0.031 LGUNEM — 2.28 R — 0.36               it

                             (0.014)         .
                                                 (0.62)        (0.21)


          R2 =   0.99;       SSR =     0.0087;    SE =    0.021



where LG refers to natural logarithms, (—1) to a one—period lag, R

to the estimated real net rate of return,                 it   to   the expected rate of in-

flation, UNEM to the unemployment rate, WLTH to the market value of
                                          21



assets, DPI to disposable private income and CONSP to consumption.

     This equation is estimated by an instrumental variables procedure

which uses as instruments principal components of the variables usually

deemed exogeneous in large macroeconometric models (see Amemiya [19661

and Jorgenson and Brundy [1973]). It performs quite well by conventional

measures. The estimated standard error is a minute fraction of the mean

value of the left—hand variable. The estimated real net rate of return

elasticity of private saving is slightly larger than 0.4.

     My other specifications yield estimated real net interest elasticities

of 0.2 to 0.6 (see Boskin [1977]). While such elasticities are hardly

enormous, they are much larger than those suggested by advocates of extremely

high taxes on capital income. We shall return to some extremely important

policy implications in our next section. For the moment, it suffices to

note that saving apparently is modestly sensitive to the taxation of capital

income.

     What about labor supply? There is also a conventional wisdom that

taxes do not affect incentives to work (again, see Okun [19751). A more

detailed examination of this issue suggests that the effect of taxes on

total labor supply —     including   hours of work, work effort and human invest-
ment —    is   quite difficult to estimate; we have a fairly useful set of esti-

mates of the effects of taxes on hours of work. This effect appears to

differ dramatically among alternative population subgroups. Unfortunately,

we know little about the effects of taxes on effort or human investment.

    The renewed interest in estimating labor supply functions in the U.S.

occurs not only because of the availability of better data and improved
                                      22



estimation techniques, but because of the hotly debated issue of the

desirability of a universal income guarantee or negative income tax. Ob-

viously, the attention of both the politicians and the researcher has been

on the effects of negative income taxation on the work effort of the poor,

the recipients of the negative taxes. The theory of optimal taxation, of

course, reveals that the potential disincentive effects of the high tax

rates on the non—poor (used to finance the transfer) are at least equally

important.

    The concept of labor supply relevant in our context is labor supply

in the envelope sense.      Thus, effective labor supply reflects decisions

on hours of work, human investment and effort, as well as the individual's

ability. For expository convenience, suppose we can write the labor supply

as the product of these variables:



             LS =   HE•AI

where H is hours, E is effort, A is ability, and I is cumulative

net human investment.

     The optimal income tax models postulate a probability distribution of

A in the population, which is given independent of taxes. H, E and I,

however, are potentially affected by income taxation.

     Little is known empirically about the effects of taxes on E, work

efforts The effects of taxes on I, human investment, are rather complex

(see Boskin [19761). There frequently has been an assumption of strong

tax disincentives to human investment. For example, Schultz [1961] argues


Since non—pecuniary benefits on the job, including less effort, presumably
    are a normal good, the (negative) income effect of the tax probably
    increases effort.
                                        23




that "Our tax laws everywhere discriminate against human capital." Certainly

this has never been documented empirically. Nor do adherents to this view

identify the real culprit in the situation. Is it the taxation of the

returns to human investment at a positive rate? Is it the progressive

rate structure of the personal income tax? Is it the failure to allow

educational expense deducations? Is it the income effect of the tax com-

bined with differential public and private marginal propensities to invest

in human capital?

        While the effects of the personal income tax on human capital invest-

ment depends upon all of these details, we begin by focusing on what we

believe to be the single most important feature of the relation between

human capital investment and the tax system, namely that the bulk of such

investments are financed out of foregone earnings which are not taxed. The

failure to appreciate this basic feature of human investment is, we believe,

a source of much of the confusion on the effects of taxes on human invest—
        12
ment.

        For example, take on—the—job training financed by tax—free foregone

earnings. In the absence of an income tax, the worker would engage in on—

the—job training up to the point where the incremental investment cost just

matched the present value of expected future returns. The imposition of a

flat rate tax t on the income from the investment reduces the net return

by (1 —      t);   the instantaneous write—off (since the investment cost is

tax free) reduces the tax liability by (1 —      t)   (at the margin). The


12Becker [19641 and Goode [1962] do point this out; of course, it is after
    individuals have reacted to the tax that the bulk of finance consists
    of foregone earnings.
                                         24




present value of the depreciation deduction equals the cost of the invest-

ment and if the training was a profitable investment with no tax, it is

still profitable in the presence of the tax—free foregone earnings.

     The major human capital investment cost which is not tax exempt is

the direct cost of education, i.e., tuition, books and related expenses.

It is these expenses which have received the most attention in the public

finance literature. The argument has been that such expenditures are a

valid cost of earning income and should be deductible either when made or

depreciated throughout the working life.'3 While true economic deprecia-

tion of educational expenses would be nondistortionary (since under true

economic depreciation the differential equation describing the value of

human capital is independent of the tax rate, the value of the investment
                                    14
would not be affected by the tax)        it is not the only way to achieve

neutrality. Indeed, any tax which between its interest deductibility and

depreciation allowances yields a deduction whose present value equals the

investment cost is neutral. While I would be the last to argue that

capital markets work perfectly, particularly in financing human investment,

a modest fraction of higher education expenses are financed by borrowing

and at least the interest on this debt is deductible against future income.

     In analyzing when tax depreciation of educational expenses would be

neutral it is important to note that many students investing in education

have little other income and hence would not benefit from immediate



'3See Goode [19621 for a discussion of these issues. Frequently ignored is
    the lack of taxation on the human capital gain during education; this
    tax is postponed until the Income stream is realized.

14See Stiglitz [1975]. Indeed, this discussion closely follows his dis-
    cussion of tax depreciation of physical capital.
                                     25




 write—off of out—of—pocket educational expenses. 15       Unless they
were allowed to carry such a write—off forward for a considerable period,

 the present value of the depreciation allowance will fall short of the

present value of the tax liability on the return to the investment and

hence will discourage investment in education.

     The progressive rate structure of the personal income tax acts in an

analogous manner and not just on educational investments. Any human cap-

ital investment which increases future earnings enough to drive the tax-

payer into a higher tax bracket (after accounting for income averaging

provisions) may decrease the ratio of the present value of the deprecia-

tion allowance to the present value of the incremental tax liability.

Investments which are profitable at the current tax rate may not be so

when account is taken of the increased future tax rate.

     In addition to the distortion in the amount of the investment in

human capital, the tax system also alters the composition of human invest-

ment. For example, the instantaneous depreciation of foregone earnings

(relative to slower economic depreciation) favors longer—lived human invest-

ments, e.g., general, rather than job specific, on—the—job training.

     In summary, the current progressive rate structure of the personal

Income tax probably creates a disincentive to accumulate human capital;

this disincentive is perhaps most severe for secondary workers in two—

earner families whose incremental incomes from human investment may gen-

erate a large increase in marginal tax rates. The lack of an educational

                                      26



expenditure depreciation allowance probably biases investments away from

education to job training. While the extent of these distortions is not

yet known, the fact that the bulk of such investment is financed by tax—

free foregone earnings casts doubt on the assertion that such disincentives

are large.

       What about tax disincentives to hours of work? A large number of

empirical studies have been completed recently (see, e.g., the studies in

Cain and Watts [1974], Heckinan [19741, Rosen [19761, and Hurd [19761).

These studies report labor supply elasticities which differ somewhat, but

as a whole they reveal the following: the hours of work of the largest

group in the labor force — husbands —      is   not very elastic. Hurd's [1976]

estimates (which in many ways are the best, accounting for numerous

econometric problems) are the largest: an average elasticity of one—half;

the other studies estimate less elastic hours of work for husbands.

However, the hours of work of secondary workers —       particularly wives   and

elderly persons (see Boskin [1977]), are quite sensitive to (tax—induced)

variations in the net wage. The estimated wage elasticity of labor supply

for. wives usually exceeds unity.

       What then, shall we conclude about labor supply? While much more

work needs to be done before we can pin down the elasticities for different

groups precisely, we can conclude the following:

       1) Taxes affect the hours of work of wives and elderly persons

           substantially (as the wage elasticity of hours of work for

           these groups is large);

   •   2) Taxes do not appear to affect the hours of work of husbands

             (although we should be careful about extrapolating to extremely

           high rates) nearly as much as they do wives and elderly persons;
                                      27


     3) Taxes may   distort   both the composition and the amount of human

         investment; however, the effect on total human   investment   is

         mitigated substantially by the tax—free nature of foregone

         earnings, the major source of finance for human investment.

     4) Virtually nothing is known about the effects of taxes on the

         level of effort.

     With these empirical studies of labor supply and saving in mind,

we turn now to a discussion of their implications f or tax policy.
                                    28




4. Implications for Tax Policy



     The theory of optimal taxation, combined with econometric evidence

on labor supply and saving, has important implications for a variety of

issues in tax policy. We shall discuss their Implications for three

features of the U.S. tax system: the income—splitting provision for two—

earner families, the rate structure of the Income tax, and the choice be-

tween income and consumption as the tax base. We start by dealing with

piecemeal policy changes and then note their Interrelation.

     The theory of optimal taxation Implies that, ceteris paribus, income

tax rates should be higher on those population groups with the lowest

labor supply elasticities. Thus, income tax rates should be higher on

the primary earner in the family (usually the husband) than on the secon-

dary earner(s).

     Thus, the income—splitting provision, which allows spouses to pool

their income and to be taxed as if each earned one—half of the total, is

inefficient. In making the marginal tax rate paid on the first dollar

of earnings of the secondary worker equal to that paid on the last dollar

of earnings of the first workers this provision can reduce substantially

the after—tax wage received by the secondary worker. It is not uncommon

in middle—class families in the United States for the marginal tax rate

on the first dollar earned by the secondary worker in the family to reach

forty percent or more; and to this must be added transportation and other

costs. Combined with the non—negligible wage elasticity of the labor

supply of wives (who frequently are the secondary earner in the family),

this implies a huge labor supply disincentive.      Sometimes this
                                      29



takes the form of withdrawal (permanently or periodically) from the

labor force.

       I have estimated (see Boskin [1974]) the welfare cost of the tax—

Induced   reallocation of the capital stock and labor force between the mar-

ket and the home to exceed $20 billion, an astounding waste of resources.'6

       While the econometric evidence is not in sufficient agreement to permit

an exact calculation of the optimal tax rates for primary and secondary

earners, the estimates are similar enough and sufficiently robust to con-

clude that the tax rates on secondary earners ought to be substantially

less than those on primary earners. Clearly, abolition of the income—

splitting provision would be a major improvement; we may eventually have

precise enough estimates to propose a new set of rate schedules in which

the rates differ not only by individual income, but also by whether the

Individual is the primary or secondary earner in the family.

      The optimal income tax literature warns us of the danger of extremely

high marginal tax rates on population groups with some elasticity to their

labor supply. While the evidence for the bulk of the labor force — husbands
—   suggests only a small elasticity of hours of work, to this must be added
any disincentives to human investment and work effort. As noted above,

empirical information on these issues is rather desperately needed. My

own opinion is that there is enough of an elasticity to argue against

extremely high rates of tax but not so high as that frequently assumed in

producing the very low rates reported in the optimal Income tax literature.



        includes the effect of other taxes and the reallocation of capital
     as well as labor.
                                       30




       Since the disincentives depend heavily upon the marginal tax rates, a

strong argument can be made for broadening the base of the tax and lowering

the rates.'7 While I do not agree that there is no justification for many

of the provisions in our various taxes which reduce their bases substantial-

ly (e.g., taxable income in the U.S. individual income tax is perhaps one—

third   of income correctly measured), one way to reduce the tax rates is to
broaden the tax   base.'8   A second, of course, is to   decrease the revenue

raised   by the government. The optimal income tax     literature   suggests that
rather   little public income redistribution is desirable, a striking contrast

to the trends in virtually all advanced economies. This issue is deserving

of a deeper analysis than I can provide here; I merely mention that I have

elsewhere (Boskin and Sheshinski [1976]) suggested a possible explanation

for this disparity (a relative income effect).

       What does the evidence suggest as to the choice between income and

consumption as the appropriate base of tax? I hope I have convinced you

that saving is by no means in completely inelastic supply. Hence, a tax

only on capital income is ruled Out by the basic results of optimal tax

theory. I also believe that between the hours of work of secondary earners

and the hours, effort, and human investment of primary workers that there is enough

elasticity of aggregate labor supply to rule out a labor income tax as the

only form of taxation, i.e., a consumption tax alone is not optimal. How-

ever, in the U.S. (as in most other countries) capital income is taxed at

much higher rates than is labor income accruing to the same individual.


17
     Such as advocated by Pechman [1973].

18lndeed, the flow of income into tax—free activities occurs largely
    because of the high marginal tax rates.
                                   31




The separate corporate income and property taxes, the ceiling on tax rates

on earned income and certain other provisions make the marginal tax rate on

(a large share of) income from capital much higher than that on labor income.

This has reduced saving in the U.S. by a large amount; in turn, the reduction

in capital accumulation has decreased income and welfare and raised the return

on capital relative to that on labor. Again, I have analyzed this in detail

elsewhere (Boskin f 1977]). My conclusion is that the rates of tax on capital

income should be lowered relative to those on labor income; optimal tax

theory and the econometric evidence point strongly in this direction. Such

policies as integrating the corporate and personal income tax and/or reforming

the taxation of individuals in the direction of a consumption tax are desirable.

    Many authors have concluded that a very progressive personal income

tax is desirable. The analysis and empirical results suggest that

extensive progression and income taxation do not go together: the larger

the wage elasticity of labor supply, cet. par, the less progression Is

desirable and the more desirable is the taxation of interest income; the

lower this elasticity, the more progression is desirable and the more

desirable is the exemption of interest income from taxation.

    The three policies discussed above have an important interrelation. If

we abolished income—splitting in favor of a separate, lower rate schedule

for secondary earners, part of the labor supply disincentive which inhibits

high marginal rates on labor Income could be overcome. A more comprehensive

tax base could also allow a reduction in rates which could more easily be

combined with the higher rates of tax on labor income implicit In a

consumption tax. The combination of the three policies — moving toward

a comprehensive personal tax which largely exempted the income from
                                     32



capital and embodied a separate schedule of (lower) rates for secondary

earners — would substantially improve welfare and allow a more equitable

distribution of the command over resources. The potential gains from

reducing these severe tax   distortions   in our economy are enormous. While

I   believe we have more work to do before we can recommend precisely

optimal policies, on many important issues, including the three discussed

above, the theory and evidence are sufficiently clear in their implica-

tions to provide an important impetus to tax reform today.
