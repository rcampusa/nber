                                              ABSTRACT

We analyze a model of informed trading where an activist shareholder accumulates shares in an anonymous
market and then expends costly effort to increase the firm value. We find that equilibrium prices are
affected by the position accumulated by the activist, because the level of effort undertaken is increasing
in the size of his acquired position. In equilibrium, price impact has two components: one due to asymmetric
information (as in the seminal Kyle (1985) model) and one due to moral hazard (a new source of illiquidity).
Price impact is higher the more severe the moral hazard problem, which corresponds to a more productive
activist. We thus obtain a trade-off: with more noise trading (less `price efficiency') the activist can
build up a larger stake, which leads to more effort expenditure and higher firm value (more `economic
efficiency').

1. Introduction

       Activist shareholders play an active role in modern corporate governance. Among
the most active and visible activists are outside shareholders who identify a firm with the
potential for value creation, purchase a significant number of shares in the open market
and then publicly announce their intention to influence management.1 The empirical
literature suggests that these activists are often successful in increasing the value of
targeted companies (e.g., Brav, Jiang, Partnoy, and Thomas, 2008). The key ingredient
to the success of outside activists is their ability to purchase shares in the open market
before stock prices reflect their intention to become active, and therefore to increase firm
value. The value created presumably depends on the activist’s effort expenditure, which
in turn depends on the size of the stake that was acquired during the trading period.
The larger the stake the higher the incentives for the insider to provide additional effort.
Thus, there is a fundamental link between market conditions that influence the block
acquisition process, the activist’s final position, the activist’s effort expenditure, and the
firm’s value.
       In his seminal contribution, Kyle (1985) derives the equilibrium price dynamics in
a model where a large trader possesses long-lived private information about the value
of a stock that will be revealed at some known date, and optimally trades into the
stock to maximize his expected profits. Risk-neutral market makers try to infer from

   1
    Activist hedge funds constitute the core of this group. Carl Icahn, who manages several activist
hedge funds, is one prime example of such outside activist shareholder. Activist shareholders also
include long-term shareholders who own large stakes of a company, monitor management, and influence
management in various ways. Pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies are among
prominent representatives of this group.



                                                 2
aggregate order flow the information possessed by the insider. Because order flow is also
driven by uninformed ‘noise traders,’ who trade solely for liquidity purposes, prices are
not fully revealing. Instead, prices respond linearly to order flow. In Kyle’s model the
insider has private information about a value that is independent of his actions. In other
words, after the start of the trading game the insider cannot affect the liquidation value.
Whether or not the insider chooses to trade in the stock, this value will be realized.
   In this paper we generalize Kyle’s model (in the continuous time formulation given
by Back, 1992) of informed trading to an activist who can affect the liquidation value
of the firm by expending effort at some cost. We solve for the optimal effort level and
trading strategy of the activist, as well as for the equilibrium price and corresponding
market liquidity. The key feature of the model is that the activist’s optimal effort level
is increasing in the size of the stake he has accumulated. The endogenous liquidation
value of the firm is thus a function of the position accumulated by the insider, which
itself depends on the noise trading activity (market liquidity). The model thus delivers
an intricate relation between price and market liquidity.
   Unlike in the original Kyle/Back model where the position of the insider is irrelevant
for the equilibrium price in our setting the market maker’s estimate of (and uncertainty
about) the position of the activist affects the equilibrium price.       Therefore, price
dynamics are more complex than in the standard Kyle/Back model.
   First, in equilibrium, price impact has two components: an asymmetric information
component due to the fact that the activist has better information about the exogenous
component of the liquidation value (his ‘stock picking’ ability similar to Kyle’s model)
and a moral hazard component due to the fact that the position accumulated by the


                                            3
activist will affect the endogenous component of the liquidation value through his effort
level (his ‘share-holder activism’ ability). While total price impact (measured by the
response of price to order flow) is constant in our model, each component fluctuates over
time.
       In the earlier stage of the game the dominant part of the price impact is typically due
to the asymmetric information component. In contrast, closer to the end of the trading
period the dominant part of the price impact is due to the moral hazard component.
The intuition is that the uncertainty about the position of the activist, which governs
the moral hazard component of price impact, tends to grow over time in the early part
of the trading game, whereas the uncertainty about the exogenous component of the
liquidation value always decreases over time.
       Second, in equilibrium price impact is higher the more severe the moral hazard
problem, which corresponds to cases where the activist is more productive (i.e., can
more influence the terminal value), or where the uncertainty about his position is larger.
This is a source of price impact that has not, to the best of our knowledge, been studied
in previous models.2
       Third, the uncertainty about the source of value creation develops in a very special
way. If there is no uncertainty about the exogenous component of firm value and all
adverse selection comes from moral hazard, then the market will learn perfectly the value
created by the activist. If however, there is uncertainty about the exogenous component

   2
     For example, in Kyle-Back’s original model the prior distribution of the initial position of the insider
is irrelevant to the equilibrium given a prior for the exogenous component of the liquidation value. In
contrast, in our paper information about the activist’s position is directly relevant for market liquidity.
This also has implications for disclosure regulations which we discuss further below.


                                                     4
of firm value, then there is some ‘signal jamming’: the market has difficulty separating
its estimate of the exogenous and endogenous components of firm value. This seems
important given the debate about the social ‘usefulness’ of activists. Are they simply
better stock-pickers or do they really create value for minority shareholders by expending
effort? The model suggests that this is very difficult for the market to sort out, if there
is uncertainty about the activists holdings.
   Fourth, the model shows how ownership disclosure regulation can affect economic
efficiency. The model suggests that if we can force the activist to disclose his holdings,
i.e. reduce uncertainty about his position, then this makes it easier for the market to
sort out his ‘stock-picking’ from his ‘managerial’ abilities. From that perspective, if it is
desirable to remunerate activists only for their efforts, ownership disclosure requirements
may be useful. Of course, this may also have unintended consequences for economic
efficiency, as it leads them to accumulate fewer shares and thus expend less effort on
average. In addition, the model informs the debate about the optimal duration of the
pre-disclosure period (e.g., Bebchuk, Brav, Jackson, and Jiang, 2013). The model shows
that shortening the period during which the activist can trade anonymously may have
negative consequences for economic efficiency, as it leads the activist to accumulate fewer
shares and therefore expend less effort.
   Finally, we obtain a trade-off between economic efficiency and price efficiency. With
more noise trading the activist can build up a larger stake, and then expend more effort
to increase firm value, thus leading to higher economic efficiency.
   The paper concludes with a description of some empirical regularities, which are
consistent with the proposed model. Using hand-collected data on trades by activist


                                               5
shareholders (see Collin-Dufresne and Fos, 2013a, for detailed description of the dataset),
we show that an activist’s trading strategy depends not only on the ‘valuation gap’, but
also on his stake size. This is in contrast to the Kyle (1985) model, in which the trading
strategy of the informed trader depends on the ‘valuation gap’ only. We also show that
the activist’s stake size is positively associated with the value creation for shareholders
of targeted company, conditional on the total share turnover during the accumulation
period. Finally, when we analyze the characteristics of targeted companies, we find
evidence consistent with the proposed model. For example Schedule 13D filers are more
likely to target firms with low stock illiquidity, high idiosyncratic volatility, and high
proportion of shares owned by activist hedge funds. In addition, when compared to
non-targeted companies, targeted firms are older, they have lower market capitalization,
higher book-to-market ratio, and higher proportion of shares owned by institutional
investors. This evidence is consistent with evidence on shareholder activism (e.g., Brav
et al., 2008; Fos, 2012).
   Related Literature
   This paper is related to several strands of literature.
   First, the paper contributes to the microstructure literature. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to endogenize the terminal firm value. For example, in Kyle
(1985) the terminal firm value is exogenous. Similarly, the literature has maintained
the assumption of an exogenous terminal firm value (e.g., Glosten and Milgrom, 1985;
Easley and O’Hara, 1987; Back, 1992).
   Second, the paper contributes to the corporate governance literature which inves-




                                            6
tigates the role of blockholders in monitoring the management.3 To the best of our
knowledge, there is no dynamic model which incorporates anonymous trading by an
informed investor who can endogenously change the firm value. Shleifer and Vishny
(1986) analyze the role of a large minority shareholder in solving the Grossman and
Hart (1980a) free-rider problem and show that the large shareholder’s return on his own
shares suffices to cover his monitoring and takeover costs. In their static model firm
value is affected by effort expenditure by the large shareholder, which is increasing in
the large shareholder’s stake. Admati, Pfleiderer, and Zechner (1994) develop a static
model in which a large shareholder has access to a costly monitoring technology affecting
securities’ expected payoffs. In their model the large shareholder trades off the benefits
(more profits from monitoring) and costs (more losses from risk-sharing) of owning a
large stake. Similarly to Shleifer and Vishny (1986), monitoring by the large shareholder
is costly and is more efficient the higher his stake in the company.
       The common feature of these models is that the large shareholder cannot increase
his stake by trading anonymously. This is the main innovation of our paper, in which
the activist can trade in anonymous markets to change his stake size. Moreover, our
model is dynamic.4
       Third, the paper contributes to the literature that studies the role of noise trading

   3
    See Edmans (2013) for survey of blockholders and corporate governance literature.
   4
    An exception is Noe (2002), who develops a static model in which strategic investors produce
private information through their own action. Monitoring induces a fixed private cost to the investor.
The microstructure set up of the model is special, as the market maker does not condition quotes
on aggregate order flow (see his discussion on page 311). The main reason for making this simplifying
assumption is that there is no need to update market maker’s prior beliefs, which is non-trivial when the
terminal value of stock is endogenous. While in our dynamic model the terminal value is endogenous,
we are able to solve the model when the market maker conditions prices on the order flow.

as a solution to the Grossman and Hart (1980a) free-rider problem. Kyle and Vila
(1991) develop a static model in which noise trading provides camouflage that helps
an outside shareholder to purchase enough shares at favorable prices so that takeovers
become profitable. The main result is that noise trading has a positive impact on profits
of large shareholder but has undetermined effects on economic efficiency. Specifically,
noise trading encourages fewer (more) takeovers when takeovers would otherwise always
(never) occur. However, unlike in our paper, Kyle and Vila (1991) assume that the
takeover premium the large shareholder must pay to takeover the firm is exogenous and
that the initial stake of the large shareholder is exogenously given, which essentially
avoids the moral hazard problem we study. Maug (1998) endogenizes the initial stake
of the large shareholder in a static model and shows that market liquidity mitigates the
free-rider problem by allowing the informed activist shareholder to purchase shares at a
discount from uninformed shareholders. If the activist intervenes, firm value increases
by an exogenously given amount. The main innovation of our model is that we study
the dynamic relation between noise trading, share accumulation and effort expenditure
by the activist.
   Fourth, the paper contributes to the literature that studies price informativeness.
In the seminal paper of Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), market participants trade off
costs and benefits of becoming informed. In equilibrium, prices depend on the relative
weight of informed traders. Firm value, however, is exogenously determined and is
not affected by traders’ decision to become informed. Our paper suggests a trade off
between economic efficiency (i.e., effort expenditure by activist shareholder) and price
efficiency. We show that noise traders contribute to economic efficiency by increasing


                                           8
the activist’s optimal stake and therefore effort expenditure but have a negative impact
on price efficiency by keeping prices from converging to their terminal value.
       Fifth, the paper is related to the literature that studies optimal disclosure (e.g.,
Grossman and Hart, 1980b). Our paper shows that information on activists’ positions
can be valuable and significantly affect market liquidity, price efficiency and economic
efficiency. Indeed, in our model more disclosure about activists positions may improve
market liquidity (i.e., reduce price impact) at the risk of lowering economic efficiency.
There is some evidence in the empirical literature that can be interpreted in light of this
prediction. For example, Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang (2013) show that institutional
investors often ask for a delayed reporting of quarter-end equity holdings. The authors
provide several pieces of empirical evidence that support private information as the
predominant motive for this activity.
       Finally, there is robust empirical evidence, consistent with our model’s predictions
and our own empirical findings, that activists tend to target (all else equal) more liquid
firms (e.g., Brav et al., 2008; Norli et al., 2010; Fos, 2012; Collin-Dufresne and Fos,
2013a).


2. Informed Trading with Hidden Action

       Our model is based on the Back (1992) continuous time version of the Kyle (1985)
model.5 The main new feature of our model is that we assume the activist trading in
                                                                      w2
the stock can choose to exert effort w paying a cost C(w) =           2ψ
                                                                           to produce the terminal

   5
    We use continuous time because of its simplicity, but in the appendix derive the discrete time one
period model for completeness.


                                                  9
(liquidation) value of v + w where v is a constant known only to him and w is a choice
variable. The parameter ψ captures the productivity of the activist.6 We assume that
the Market has an initial prior about v ∼ N (V0 , σv2 T ). For simplicity of interpretation
we focus on the case where v > V0 and the activist typically accumulates a positive
number of shares and chooses a positive effort level w (though the setting is symmetric
and allows, in principle, the activist to short the stock and furnish additional effort to
drive the value more negative). It is natural to think of this activist as a hedge-fund
activist for example.
       The second important departure from the original Kyle-Back (KB) model is that we
assume the activist may start with an initial position X0 which is known only imperfectly
by the Market. Indeed we assume the Market has an initial Gaussian prior X0 ∼
         2
N (Q0 , σX T ) which is correlated with its estimate of v and we denote their covariance
by ΣXv (0) = σXv T .7 This allows us to interpret the initial date 0 as the date at which
the activist becomes informed or as the date at which the market becomes aware of
the existence of the activist.8 It also allows us to investigate the costs and benefits of
                                                                                       2
disclosure rules for activist shareholders (which can be interpreted here as reducing σX ).
We note that the original KB model can easily be extended to random initial endowment
in stocks by the activist, since the latter plays no role in the equilibrium and indeed,

   6
      The higher ψ the more productive the activist. Note that if ψ → 0 it becomes optimal to choose
w = 0 and the problem becomes identical to the original Kyle model.
    7
      The only technical requirement we impose is that the prior Covariance matrix be positive definite.
    8
      Of course, this is not fully consistent with rational expectation, in that such an interpretation
ignores the fact that the fully rational market maker should have been aware prior to date 0 of the
possibility of such information becoming available to the activist. Modeling that is possible along the
lines of ?, but we leave such an extension for future work.




                                                  10
the equilibrium price and market liquidity are unaffected by it. This underlines the
difference between both models.
       The activist is risk-neutral and maximizes his expected terminal profit:

                     Z   T                                                                     
           max E              (υ + w − Pt )θt dt + (v + w − P0 )X0 −   C(w) |FtY , v, X0 , P0       ,   (1)
           θt ∈A,w    0



where we denote by FtY the information filtration generated by observing the entire
past history of aggregate order flow {Ys }s≤t and where P0 denotes the average price the
activist paid for his initial stake X0 . We note that unlike in the original Kyle-Back
model, it is important to condition on the initial position of the activist shareholder,
which plays an important role in our setting. For simplicity we assume that the discount
rate is zero. Timing wise, we assume that the activist chooses his effort level right ‘after’
the terminal date T , given all past information on prices and trades.9 In particular, his
optimal choice will simply maximize at T :


                                            max wXT − C(w),                                             (2)
                                             w


                      RT
where XT = X0 +           0
                              θt dt is the activist’s initial stake plus the stake accumulated during
the trading game by the activist. With our choice of cost function this leads to:


                                                 w∗ = ψXT .                                             (3)

   9
    A richer model might allow the activist to work continuously during the share accumulation phase
on the project that eventually will lead to the liquidation value. We leave such a model for future work.




                                                    11
Plugging back into his objective function we see that the activist is maximizing:

                                                    T
                                                                         ψXT2 Y
                                             Z                                         
                  (v − P0 )X0 + max E                   (v − Pt )θt dt +     |Ft , v, X0 .                  (4)
                                    θt ∈A       0                         2

       Following Back (1992) we assume that the activist chooses a trading rule θ in some
admissible set A defined to be the set of absolutely continuous trading strategies which
                                         RT
satisfy the technical restriction that E[ 0 |θs |2 ds] < ∞.10
       The market maker is risk-neutral, but does not observe the terminal value. Instead
(given his prior) he only observes the aggregate order flow, which is the sum of informed
and uninformed order flow:
                                            dYt = θt dt + σdZt ,                                            (5)

where Zt is a standard Brownian motion independent of υ.                            We assume that the
uninformed order flow volatility, σ, is constant.11
       To solve for an equilibrium, we proceed as follows. First, we derive the dynamics of
the stock price consistent with the market maker’s risk-neutral filtering rule, conditional
on a conjectured trading rule for the activist. Then we solve the activist’s optimal
portfolio choice problem, given the assumed dynamics of the equilibrium price. Finally,
we show that the conjectured rule by the market maker is indeed consistent with the

  10
      A shown in Back, it is optimal for the activist to choose an absolutely continuous trading strategy,
since, in continuous time, the market maker can immediately infer from the quadratic variation of
the order flow the informed component with infinite variation. The square integrability condition is
a technical requirement often used in continuous time to rule out specific arbitrage strategies such as
‘doubling strategies’ (see Harrison and Pliska (1979) and Dybvig and Huang (1986)).
   11
      We could easily generalize idiosyncratic volatility to be a function of posterior co-variance σ(Σt , t) as
in Baruch (2002) (though at the expense of closed-form solutions). The extension to arbitrary stochastic
processes as in Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2013b) is non-trivial and left for future research.


                                                          12
activist’s optimal choice.
   Since the market maker is risk-neutral, equilibrium imposes that


                                    Pt = E υ + w | FtY .
                                                     
                                                                                         (6)


Since the market maker is rational he knows the optimal choice of effort by the activist
will be a function of his acquired stake, i.e, that w = ψXT . The market maker will thus
filter the position of the activist. We define his estimate of the activist’s position as:


                                     Qt = E Xt | FtY
                                                    
                                                                                         (7)


and his estimate of the constant component as:


                                      Vt = E υ | FtY .
                                                   
                                                                                         (8)


   It follows from the definition of conditional expectation that:


                      Pt = E υ + ψXT | FtY = Vt + ψE QT | FtY .
                                                          
                                                                                         (9)


   We conjecture that the trading strategy of the activist will be linear in his ‘valuation
gap’ as well as his position gap:


                              θt = βt (υ − Vt ) + γt (Xt − Qt ),                        (10)


where βt measures the speed at which the activist decides to close the gap between his

                                             13
assessment of the fundamental value υ (known only to him) and the market maker’s
estimate Vt and where γt is the loading on the activist’s position estimation error made
by the market maker.
   The novel feature relative to most of the literature is that the activist does not
only trade because of his valuation gap. Instead, his trading decision is also motivated
by the accumulated position. Indeed the price has two components to its value: one
component that is independent of the action of the activist, and another that depends
on his choice of effort, which itself depends on the position he has accumulated. Thus
the price depends in equilibrium on the market’s estimate of the activist’s position in
the stock. His accumulated position has dynamics:


                                       dXt = θt dt.                                  (11)


   Now, given his conjecture about the trading dynamics of the activist, the market
maker’s optimal filtered price dynamics follows from standard results in the filtering
literature (e.g., Liptser and Shiryaev, 2001, Chapter 12). The novel feature, is that the
market maker will estimate both the fundamental value v and the position of the activist
Xt from the observed aggregate order flow. And, in equilibrium, the price dynamics will
be multi-variate Markov.
   Let’s denote the posterior covariance matrix of the filtered state St = [v; Xt ]0 by Σt
((2, 2) matrix):
                                  Σ(t) = V ar[St | FtY ].                            (12)




                                            14
   Note that:
                                 Mt = E[St | FtY ] = [Vt ; Qt ]

and for simplicity we introduce the notation:


                            Σv (t) = E (υ − Vt )2 | FtY ≡ Σ11 (t)
                                                      
                                                                                        (13)


                           ΣX (t) = E (Xt − Qt )2 | FtY ≡ Σ22 (t)
                                                      
                                                                                        (14)

                           ΣXv (t) = E (υ − Vt )Xt | FtY ≡ Σ12 (t),
                                                       
                                                                                        (15)

with initial conditions Σv (0) = σv2 T , ΣX (0) = σx2 T , and ΣXv (0) = σXv T . Σv (0)
measures the prior uncertainty about the exogenous component of private information
available to the activist, ΣX (0) measures the prior uncertainty about the activist’s
position, and ΣXv (0) measures their covariance.
   A direct application of known results on conditionally Gaussian filtering gives the
following Lemma.

Lemma 1. If the activist adopts a trading strategy of the form given in (10), then the
stock price and the filtered position of the activist given by equations (9) and (7) satisfy:


                                       dVt = λt dYt                                     (16)

                                       dQt = Λt dYt ,                                   (17)


where λt and Λt satisfy:

                                         βt Σv (t) + γt ΣXv (t)
                                λt =                                                    (18)
                                                   σ2
                                              15
                                      βt ΣXv (t) + γt ΣX (t)
                              Λt =                           .                         (19)
                                                σ2

Further, the dynamics of the posterior covariance matrix is given by:


                               dΣv (t) = −λ2t σ 2 dt                                   (20)

                              dΣX (t) = Λt (2 − Λt )σ 2 dt

                              dΣXv (t) = λt (1 − Λt )σ 2 dt


Proof 1. This follows directly from an application of theorems 12.6, 12.7 in Liptser
and Shiryaev (2001). We provide a simple ‘heuristic’ motivation of the result using the
Gaussian projection theorem in the appendix.


   We now try to solve the activist’s partial equilibrium problem taking as given price
dynamics:


                                dVt = λt (θt dt + σdZt )                               (21)

                               dQt = Λt (θt dt + σdZt )                                (22)

                               dXt = θt dt.                                            (23)


   Note that if the activist indeed follows the conjectured trading rule, then both Vt and
Qt are martingales in the market maker’s filtration. It follows then from the definition
of the equilibrium price in equation (9), that the price can be rewritten simply as:


                                     Pt = Vt + ψQt                                     (24)



                                           16
and that its dynamics are:
                                  dPt = (λt + ψΛt )dYt .                              (25)

Following the intuition from Kyle-Back’s original model, we may conjecture that in
equilibrium the total price impact λt + ψΛt will be constant. Indeed, since the activist is
risk-neutral, he would otherwise seek to concentrate all his trading in periods with the
lowest total price impact. We shall thus seek an equilibrium with this property. Further,
we conjecture that in equilibrium the posterior variance of the price should converge to
zero, since otherwise the risk-neutral activist could change his trading strategy to take
advantage of positive expected return trades. We first prove that there exists a trading
strategy that leads to such an outcome.

Lemma 2. Suppose that the activist chooses his trading strategy as conjectured in (10),
with
                                                        ∆σ 2
                               γt = ψβt   and    βt =        ,                        (26)
                                                        Ωt
where
                           Ωt = Σv (t) + 2ψΣXv (t) + ψ 2 ΣX (t).                      (27)

Then the total price impact due to Bayesian updating is constant:


                                      λt + ψΛt = ∆                                    (28)


and
                                Ωt = Ω0 + (2ψ − ∆)∆σ 2 t.                             (29)

                                    ˆ such that ΩT = 0 given by:
   Further, there exists a positive ∆

where α is the ‘signal to noise ratio’ defined as

where we define the annualized quantity of initial private information ω 2 =   T
                                                                                    = συ2 +
2ψσXυ + ψ 2 σX
             2                      ˆ the expression for Ωt simplifies:
               . For this choice of ∆


                                       Ωt = ω 2 (T − t).                               (32)


Proof 2. Suppose the activist adopts the conjectured trading strategy.     Then using
equations (18) and (19) we immediately obtain:


                                      λt + ψΛt = ∆ ∀t.


Further, using the dynamics of the covariance matrix in (20) we find that when the
activist follows such a strategy:


                                    dΩt = (2ψ − ∆)∆σ 2 dt.


It follows that Ωt = Ω0 + (2ψ − ∆)∆σ 2 t, and thus the equation ΩT = 0 admits two roots
                                            ˆ in the Lemma.
for ∆ one of which is positive and given by ∆


   By definition Ωt = V ar[v + ψXt | FtY ]. For the conjectured equilibrium Ωt given in


                                              18
(32) decays linearly, which is reminiscent of the dynamics of the posterior variance of
the estimated liquidation value in the original Kyle (1985) model. Note however that
the dynamics of Ωt is affected by the prior uncertainty about the position of the activist,
which is irrelevant in the original Kyle model (as can be verified by taking the limit
ψ → 0).
                                  ˆ obtained in this model is always greater than that
   Indeed, the total price impact ∆
obtained in a model without moral hazard (i.e., when ψ = 0) in which case it becomes
                                                   ˆ
identical to price impact obtained in the KB model ∆|    =         σv
                                                                      .   In fact, price-impact
                                                     ψ=0           σ

in our model depends on only two quantities: the productivity of the activist ψ and
                            ω
the signal to noise ratio   σ
                              .   It is increasing in both. Interestingly the signal to noise
ratio relevant for the moral hazard model depends on the prior uncertainty about the
activist’s position (σX , σXv ) which is irrelevant in the KB model.
   Further, note that Ωt is not equal to the posterior variance of the liquidation value
(the latter is V ar[v + ψXT | FtY ]). Instead, Ωt can be interpreted as the variance of the
liquidation value of the stock if it were liquidated at the present time t. Indeed, Ωt
converges at maturity to the variance of the terminal stock price liquidation value. In
fact, we have that ΩT = E[(v + ψXT − PT )2 | FTY ]. And since the previous result shows
that (for the conjectured equilibrium) ΩT = 0, this suggests that we should obtain a
convergence result for the equilibrium price also in the filtration of the activist. Indeed,
we can prove the following.

Lemma 3. Suppose the trading strategy followed by the activist is as described in
Lemma 2. Then, in the filtration Ft of the activist, the equilibrium price process is



                                               19
two-factor Markov in state variables Pt and Xt and is given by:

                                           (v + ψXt − Pt )dt + ∆σdZt                  (33)
                               ω 2 (T − t)
                                    ˆ 2

                     dXt     =             (v + ψXt − Pt )dt.                         (34)
                               ω 2 (T − t)

In the filtration of the activist, the price process Pt converges in L2 to v + ψXT at
maturity. Note that in the filtration of the market maker, the stock price Pt is a Brownian
martingale.

Proof 3. By definition Pt = Vt + ψQt . Thus:


                          ˆ t
                    dPt = ∆dY                                                         (35)
                              ˆ t ((v − Vt ) + ψ(Xt − Qt ))dt + ∆σdZ
                            = ∆β                                ˆ    t                (36)
                                 ˆ
                               (∆σ)   2
                            =                                 ˆ
                                        (v + ψXt − Pt )dt + ∆σdZ  t.                  (37)
                               2
                              ω (T − t)

   Of course, in the filtration of the market maker price is a martingale, since
                                                    ˆ t.
E[dYt | FtY ] = 0, and d[Y, Y ]t = σ 2 dt and dPt = ∆dY
   Now, define ht = Pt − v − ψXt . We want to show that ht converges to zero. Its
dynamics are:


                               dht = dPt − ψdXt                                       (38)
                                       1+κ          ˆ
                                   = −      ht dt + ∆σdZt,                            (39)
                                       T −t

where:

                                              p
                                 κ = ζ2 + ζ    1 + ζ2 > 0                             (40)

                                 ζ =       .                                                  (41)
                                        ω

We can thus compute
                                   ht = h0 e−At + e−At Mt ,                                   (42)
              Rt                                                 Rt
where At =        (1+κ)
                        du   = log( TT−t )1+κ and Mt =                     ˆ
                                                                      e−As ∆σdZs is an Ft -adapted
                0 T −u                                            0

Brownian martingale. We can calculate the quadratic variation of Mt from
                                               Z   t
                               < M >t =                       ˆ 2 ds
                                                       e−2As (∆σ)                             (43)
                                               0
                                               2At
                                         = e           Ωt − Ω0                                (44)


Thus for any t < T we see that Mt is a square integrable martingale and that limt→T <
M >t = ∞. If follows that E[ht ] = h0 e−At ∀t < T and that since κ > 0 we obtain
limt→T E[ht ] = 0. Further, for any t < T we have E[h2t ] = h20 e−2At + e−2At < M >t =
(h20 − Ω0 )e−2At + Ωt . Since ΩT = 0 and κ > 0 we have limt→T E[h2t ] = 0. This establishes
L2 convergence of ht to 0 at T.

Remark 1. The previous lemma implies that (T − t)κ (Pt − v − ψXt ) converges
almost surely to zero at T with κ defined in equation (40).                          Indeed, note
that there exists an Ft adapted brownian motion Bt such that Mt = B<M >t .
Further, by the Strong law of large numbers for Brownian motions (Karatzas
                                                           Bu
and Shreve (1988) p.         104) we have limu→∞            u
                                                                 = 0 a.s..     Combining we see
                                    B<M >t −2At
that limt→T e−2At Mt = limt→T       <M >t
                                          e             < M >t = 0 a.s..           It follows that
( TT−t )1+κ ht = h0 e−2At + e−2At Mt converges almost surely to 0 at time T .                 We
note that if ψ = 0 then κ = 0. So this proves almost sure convergence of the price to
the terminal value v if there is no Moral Hazard. We conjecture (but have not yet been
able to prove) that Pt − v − ψXt converges a.s. to zero also when ψ > 0.

                                               21
       We now turn to the optimal policy of the activist. We want to show that given the
conjectured equilibrium price impact process, the strategy conjectured by the market
maker is indeed a best response for the activist. Note that the expected profits of the
activist given in equation (4) can be rewritten as follows:12

                                                         T
                               X02
                                                   Z                                              
               (v − P0 )X0 + ψ     + max E                   (v − Pt +   ψXt )θt dt |FtY , v, X0
                               2     θt ∈A           0

Since the first two terms do not affect his choice13 we define the following value function
that captures the optimization problem of the insider:

                                      Z    T                                           
                     J(t) = max E               (v − Ps +     ψXs )θs ds |FtY , v, Xt       .          (45)
                              θs ∈A     t



       We show the following.

Proposition 1. Suppose that prices have dynamics


                                                dPt = ∆dYt                                             (46)


for some constant ∆. Suppose further that there exists an admissible trading strategy θ∗
such that E[(PT − v − ψXT )2 ] = 0, then θ∗ is an optimal trading strategy and the optimal

     This follows from the fact that 2T = 20 + 0 Xt dXt = 20 + 0 Xt θt dt.
  13
     Note that the sum of these two terms is equal to the expected profit of the insider were he to not
accumulate any additional share after time 0 and then provide the optimal effort at maturity (given
that XT = X0 ).

value function is given by:

                                     (P − v − ψXt )2 + ∆2 σ 2 (T − t)
                      J(P, X, t) =                                    .                                  (47)
                                               2(∆ − ψ)

Proof 4. Consider the function

                                     (P − v − ψXt )2 + ∆2 σ 2 (T − t)
                      J(P, X, t) =                                    .                                  (48)
                                               2(∆ − ψ)

Applying Itô’s lemma we find:

                                           T                                         T
(PT − v − ψXT )2                                                                         (P − v − ψX)
                                      Z                                         Z
                 − J(P0 , X0 , 0) +            (v + ψXt − Pt )θt dt =                                 ∆σdZt .
    2(∆ − ψ)                           0                                         0          (∆ − ψ)

First, note that the right hand side is a square integrable martingale for any admissible
                                                                                RT
trading strategy. Indeed, note that any admissible trading strategy satisfies E[ 0 Xt2 dt] <
                                                                                Rt
∞. (To see this simply note that by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality Xt2 = ( 0 θs ds)2 ≤
Rt 2                                                                          RT
   θ ds.) Then note that Pt = ∆(Xt − X0 ) + ∆σ(Zt − Z0 ) and thus E[ 0 (Pt − v −
 0 s

ψXt )2 dt] < ∞ for any admissible trading strategy.
   Thus, taking expectations it follows that for any admissible trading strategy θt we
have:
                                                                     T
                               (PT − v − ψXT )2
                                                              Z                             
            J(P0 , X0 , 0) = E                  +                        (v + ψXt − Pt )θt dt .          (49)
                                   2(∆ − ψ)                      0

Since E [(PT − v − ψXT )2 ] ≥ 0, it follows that for any admissible θt we have
                                               Z    T                       
                       J(P0 , X0 , 0) ≥ E                (v + ψXt − Pt )θt dt .                          (50)
                                                 0


And if there exists an admissible trading strategy θt∗ such that E [(PT − v − ψXT )2 ] = 0
then the (weak) inequality holds with equality. This establishes the optimality of such a

trading strategy θt∗ and of the value function.

   Combining the verification theorem with the previous lemmas we have the main
result of this paper.

Proposition 2. There exists an equilibrium characterized by deterministic functions λt
and Λt such that total price impact is constant:
                                                     r
                                      ˆ := ψ +                  ω2
                           λt + ψΛt = ∆                  ψ2 +      ∀t,                 (51)
                                                                σ2

where ω 2 = σv2 + 2ψσvX + ψ 2 σX
                               2
                                 . The optimal trading strategy for the activist is:

                                         ˆ 2
                                         ∆σ
                                 θt∗ =       (v + ψXt − Pt ),                          (52)
                                         Ωt

where Ωt = ω 2 (T − t). The value function of the activist is:

                                                         ˆ 2 σ 2 (T − t)
                                       (P − v − ψXt )2 + ∆
                        J(P, X, t) =                                     .             (53)
                                                   ˆ − ψ)
                                                 2(∆

The equilibrium is revealing in that Pt converges to v + ψXt at time T .

Proof 5. Follows immediately from previous results. The admissibility of θ∗ is easily
checked.

   We note that while the dynamics of Ωt are simple, the separate dynamics of Σv (t),
ΣX (t), and ΣXv (t) are less obvious. Similarly, while the total price impact deriving
                                                                          ˆ the
from both asymmetric information and moral hazard is constant: λt + ψΛt = ∆,
individual components λt and Λt are not. We can however characterize these analytically
in closed-form, which provides further insight into the equilibrium.

Lemma 4. In equilibrium, λt = λ0 ( TT−t )κ with λ0 =                    ∆
                                                                        ω2

equation (40). Thus if λ0 = σv2 + ψσXv > 0 (resp. < 0) then λt is positive (resp.
negative) and strictly decreasing (resp. increasing) and limt→T λt = 0.
                                                         ˆ
                                                         ∆−λ
It follows that if λ0 > 0 (resp.< 0) then Λt =             ψ

and that limt→T ΛT = ∆.
Further, we can solve the system of ODE for all the posterior covariance matrix in
closed-form.

The results show that if either σX = 0 or σv = 0, then limt→T Σv (t) = limt→T ΣX (t) =
0. In other words, if there is prior uncertainty about only one of the two sources of
uncertainty (position or exogenous component of asset payoff ) then the equilibrium is
fully revealing about both the position and the terminal value of the asset (in that both
VT = v and QT = XT at maturity). Instead, if there is prior uncertainty about both
sources (both σX and σv are greater than zero), then the equilibrium reveals the total
payoff v + ψXT but not the individual components (both ΣX (T ) > 0 and Σv (T ) > 0). In
particular, the market cannot infer perfectly the effort expanded by the activist in that
case.

   The results on Λt follow from the fact that Λt = ∆
   Given the solutions for λt , Λt the covariance matrix ODE can be solved explicitly
given their initial conditions.
   We can then check the terminal value Σv (T ) and ΣX (T ) and observe that Σv (T ) =
0 ⇔ ΣX (T ) = 0 ⇐ {σv = 0 or σX = 0}.                This follows immediately from the
closed-form solution and using the fact that at any time t we have ΣXv (t) = 0           ⇐
{Σv (t) = 0 or ΣX (t) = 0}.

   We next provide some pictures of the dynamics of these variables for specific
parameter choices. We fix T = σ = 1, and ψ = 1 and consider three cases for the
initial two sources of adverse selection:

                                  2
   1. Initial position is known: σX = 0, σv2 = 1.
                                     2
   2. Exogenous component is known: σX = 1, σv2 = 0.
                         2
   3. Both are unknown: σX = 0.5, σv2 = 0.5.

                                                                       ω
In all cases, we set σXv = 0 so that the total signal to noise ratio   σ
                                                                           remains unchanged
in all three cases.
   Figure 1 shows how the private information available to the activist is revealed
through his trading activity over the trading period. Σv (t) measures the uncertainty
about the exogenous component of private information available to the activist. ΣX (t)
measures the uncertainty about the activist’s position, i.e., the moral hazard component
of adverse selection in our model. ΣXv (t) measures their dependence.
   The figure shows that, even though total uncertainty Ω(t) behaves exactly the same
across all three scenarios and whence prices behave similarly, the type of information
that gets into prices is very different depending on the initial conditions.

Figure 1: Flow of private information into Prices. This figure presents the flow
of private information into prices. Σv (t) summarizes the residual uncertainty about the
exogenous terminal value. ΣX (t) the residual uncertainty about the activist’s position.
ΣXv (t) is the covariance between both. The upper panel corresponds to the case with
ΣX (0) = 0, the middle panel to Σv (0) = 0 and the lower panel to ΣX (0) = Σv (0) = 0.5.
In all cases we set ΣXv (0) = 0.


                                              27
   If there is no uncertainty about the exogenous component of firm value (Σv (t) = 0 ∀t)
and all adverse selection comes from moral hazard, then ΣX decays over time and the
market will learn perfectly the ability of the activist to generate firm value (middle
panel). If however, there is uncertainty about the exogenous component of firm value
(that not affected by the activist), then the moral hazard component of adverse selection
tends to first grow over time as the activist is expected to accumulate more shares
and there is some ‘signal jamming’: the market has difficulty separating its estimate
of exogenous and endogenous component of firm value. In the end when maturity
approaches the market will learn the ability of the activist to add to firm value only
if there is no initial uncertainty about his position (i.e., if ΣX (0) = 0 as in the upper
panel). If the market is at the outset uncertain about both position and exogenous
firm value (i.e., if ΣX (0)Σv (0) > 0 as in the lower panel), then the market will never
be able to separate the endogenous from the exogenous firm value. For the calibration
presented the results are pretty dramatic. Starting from ΣX (0) = Σv (0) = 0.5 we end up
at ΣX (T ) = Σv (T ) ≈ 0.3, so there is considerable uncertainty about both components
remaining.
   This seems important given the debate about the social ‘usefulness’ of activists. Are
these better stock-pickers or do they really create value for minority shareholders by
expending effort? The model presented suggests that this is very difficult for the market
to sort out, if at the outset there is some uncertainty about the activists holdings. Given
our interpretation of date 0 in the model as the first time the market becomes aware
of the existence of a potential activist present in the market place, this scenario seems
the more likely. Instead, the model suggests that if we can force the activist to disclose


                                            28
information on his holdings, i.e. reduce ΣX (0), then this makes it easier for the market
to sort out his ‘stock-picking’ from his ‘managerial’ abilities. From that perspective,
if it is desirable to remunerate activists only for their efforts, disclosure requirements
may be useful. Of course, as we discuss further below this may also have unintended
consequences for economic efficiency, as it leads the activist to accumulate less shares
and thus expend less effort on average.
   Figure 2 presents the equilibrium behavior of both components of price impact Λt
                                                                ˆ (see equation
and λt (see Lemma 4). Recall that total price impact λt + ψΛt = ∆
(51)) is constant in this model. However, the figure shows that the ‘position impact’ Λt
increases monotonically closer to maturity. This is consistent with information about
the activist’s position (and therefore effort expenditure) becomes more important as
maturity approaches. Instead, λt decreases monotonically and converges to zero at
maturity.
   Next, we present the optimal trading strategy of the activist. 52 presents the optimal
trading strategy of the activist as a function of his valuation gap. β(t) in Figure 3
plots the speed at which the activist reacts to the gap between his assessment of the
fundamental value and the market maker’s estimate of the terminal firm value. Note
that as in the KB model the activist becomes more ‘aggressive’ as maturity approaches
so as to not leave any money on the table. Since he is risk-neutral, any difference between
price and expected payoff must lead to aggressive trading on the part of the activist. In
equilibrium, however, his actual trading is the product of this rate and of the valuation
gap, which disappears as maturity approaches.
   Interestingly, when we focus on the actual trading rate θt its behavior is quite different

than in the traditional Kyle model. Indeed, we can compute explicitly the unconditional
expected trading rate of the activist in his filtration E[θt |F0 , v, X0 ]. We find:

                                                            T −t κˆ

Clearly the unconditional trading rate is expected to decrease over time. Instead, when
there is no moral hazard (when ψ = 0), where the model reverts to the traditional
Kyle model, the unconditional expected trading rate is constant equal to the initial gap
                                                                                 v−P0

presence of moral hazard changes the trading strategy of the activist unconditionally

Figure 4: Optimal trading strategy. This figure shows the unconditional expected
trading rate of the activist shareholder normalized by the initial valuation gap
E[θt |F0 , v, X0 ]/G0 with G0 = (v + ψX0 − P0 ) as a function of time and compares that
to the expected trading rate in the absence of moral hazard, i.e., when ψ = 0.



   Turning to the profits of the activist investor, we plot his value function on Figure 5
as a function of his valuation gap for different levels of his productivity parameter ψ
and on Figure 6 as a function of the productivity parameter for different levels of the
valuation gap. Recall that:

                                                            ˆ 2σ2T

                                                 2(∆ˆ − ψ)


We see that for small deviations of the price from its ‘fundamental’ value, the expected
profits of the activist are increasing in his ability to create more value for shareholders.
However, when deviations are very large, then it may become decreasing in his ability. A
possible intuition for this surprising result is that increasing his ability ψ has two effects.
On the one hand, for a given stake at maturity it raises the payoff of the activist. On the
other hand, it increases his price-impact as the market maker anticipates that, which

reduces his profits. For a very large initial valuation gap, the second effect seems to
dominate.
   We can also calculate the unconditional expected profits of the activist by integrating
his value function.

Lemma 5. The unconditional expected profits of an activist is

                                                     p        
                             U (ω, ψ, σ, T ) = ωσT ζ + 1 + ζ 2

           ψσ
with ζ =   ω
                and ω 2 = σv2 + 2ψσXv + ψ 2 σX

                                               as before.

Proof 7. Taking unconditional expectation of the value function of the activist we see
that its unconditional profits are given by:

                                                   ˆ 2σ2T
                                             ω2T + ∆
                                    E[J] =                .
                                                 ˆ − ψ)
                                               2(∆

                          ˆ ∆σ
Now recall that ω 2 +(2ψ− ∆) ˆ 2 = 0. Substituting and rearranging we get the expression

in the lemma.

   We see that total unconditional profits of the activist converge to U (ω, ψ = 0, σ, T ) =
σσv T identical to KB in the absence of moral hazard. Further, differentiating the
expression given in the lemma we see that unconditional profits U (ω, ψ, σ, T ) of an
activist are increasing in (a) managerial ability (ψ), (b) (annualized) noise trading
volatility (σ), (c) initial level of (annualized) private information (ω), (d) and length
of the trading period (T ).
   Now suppose that an investor needs to pay a fixed cost to establish the potential
under or over-valuation of a given firm (v + ψX0 − P0 ), based on which he would decide

                                               34
to accumulate more shares and eventually become an activist shareholder. These costs
would be related to his research time, legal costs, etc. Say these costs amount to I. Then
it is clear that an investor would from an ex-ante perspective only spend these initial costs
if his unconditional expected profits exceed these costs, i.e., if U (ω, ψ, σ, T ) > I. This
suggests that all else equal we would expect shareholder activism to target firms with
greater (a) uncertainty about its fundamental value, (b) greater potential for managerial
impact, (c) higher stock price liquidity, and (d) longer trading period. The model thus
delivers an interesting link between ex-ante stock liquidity and corporate governance.
It also has implications for the current regulatory debate on the allowable discretionary
trading period for 13-D filers prior to their filing with the SEC (e.g., Bebchuk et al.,
2013).


3. Discussion

    The model suggests an interesting relation between economic efficiency and market
(or price) efficiency.14
    Economic Efficiency
    With respect to economic efficiency, we assume that the first best would be achieved
if the activist could acquire the entire firm and produce the optimal amount of effort

   14
      As in many models with noise-traders, since their utility is not defined, the notion of Pareto efficiency
is not well-defined. Our notion of economic efficiency refers instead to the value added by the activist
through his effort expenditure. We simply posit that the first best outcome in terms of economic
efficiency would be attained if the activist produced at the level he would if he owned the entire firm.
Similarly, the notion of price efficiency is also not well defined. Clearly in our model prices are ‘efficient’
in the sense that they always reveal all the public information available (to the market maker). Instead,
we use the term ‘price efficiency’ to indicate the degree to which prices reveal the private information
available to the activist.


                                                      35
(given his full ownership). Denote the total number of shares issued by the firm by
X.15 Then the first best effort level would be such that the firm is worth v + ψX at
time T . Now, in general, we would expect the parameters of the model to be such that
the activist will not be able to acquire the entire amount of outstanding shares before
maturity (i.e., we expect that XT < X most of the time). In that sense, first best
‘economic efficiency’ would not be achieved as long as XT < X since the activist would
not expend as much effort as he would if he owned all the firm. The model generates
clear predictions as to what drive XT the ultimate position achieved by the activist.

Lemma 6. In equilibrium the shares accumulated by the activist XT are given by

                                       v + ψX0 − P0           1
                       XT = X0 +         p          − σ(1 + q                 )ZT .

                                                                      √ 0 −P0 and
Thus XT is normally distributed with mean E[XT | F0 , v, X0 ] = X0 + v+ψX
                                                                        2  2               ψ +α

                                 ˆ t = ∆(dX
Proof 8. This follows from dPt = ∆dY   ˆ    t + σdZt ). Integrating and using the

fact that PT = v + ψXT at maturity we find:


                                       ˆ T − X0 ) + ∆σ(Z
                        v + ψXT − P0 = ∆(X          ˆ    T − Z0 ).


  15
      Note that this upper bound is not stricto-sensu part of the model. In the Kyle-type setup we
investigate, the implicit assumption is that a trader could potentially accumulate a long position larger
than the maximum available number of shares. In that case, the excess would have to be considered
a ‘derivative’ (e.g., forward) trade with the market maker that would be settled in cash and not in
kind. This interpretation poses some issues when combined with the effort model, where it would seem
‘efficient’ to take the largest possible stake in the firm to expand the largest possible effort. If we
impose that the maximum amount of effort is bounded by the available number or shares in the firm,
this introduces a non-linearity in the cost function, that one would need to explicitly take into account
at the outset. For the discussion here we ignore this complication.


                                                   36
Solving for XT and using (51) gives the result.

   This suggests that when the firm appears under-valued initially to the activist
and he would like to accumulate more shares, then the expected number of shares he
accumulates is actually decreasing in the signal to noise ratio α = ω/σ. This of course
reflects the increased price impact. So typically the more noise trading (as measured by
σ), the larger the expected number of shares the activist will accumulate (on a positive
NPV venture). As a result, the activist will expend more effort and will create more value
for shareholders. It implies a positive impact of noise trading on Economic efficiency.
                                                                                  σψ
Also, note that the variance of her position is increasing in the quantity ζ =     ω
                                                                                     .
   Lastly, note that the expected number of shares purchased is independent of maturity
T . This is true for a given annualized level of private information ω. If instead, we assume
that total initial amount of private information is given i.e., that Ω(0) is constant,
then increasing the trading period T will decrease the signal to noise ratio α (since
ω 2 := Ω(0)/T ) leading to an increase in the expected number of shares accumulated by
the activist. Therefore, for a given amount of initial private information, the longer the
period when the activist can accumulate shares anonymously, the larger the expected
number of shares the activist will accumulate (on a positive NPV venture). As a result,
the activist will expend more effort and will create more value for shareholders. It implies
a positive impact of longer pre-disclosure period on economic efficiency.
   These relation suggests there exists a trade-off between economic efficiency and price
efficiency.
   Price efficiency
   Note that in the Kyle model, ψ = 0 and markets are most efficient in the absence

                                             37
of noise traders, i.e., when σ = 0. In that case, the profits of the activist are driven to
zero, since even an infinitesimal trade will reveal all of his information. So given that
the informed is indifferent, prices might as well jump to v immediately.16 The larger
the amount of noise trading volatility the larger the activist’s profits and the less prices
reveal his information. When there is moral hazard and the activist can affect prices,
the activist will accumulate fewer shares in expectation when there is less noise trading.
Thus, he will create less wealth (since his effort is proportional to the size of his acquired
stake). Thus somewhat paradoxically, more ‘price efficiency’ (in the sense of less noise
trading activity and thus more informative prices) will lead to less economic efficiency in
the sense that the activist will create less shareholder value. This is a dynamic version of
the Grossman and Hart (1980a) free-rider problem when there are noise traders, which
offer a partial solution to that problem, as also emphasized in a one period model by
Kyle and Vila (1991) and Maug (1998).


4. Empirical Regularities

       We developed a model with endogenous effort expenditure by an activist. As we
discussed in the introduction, it is natural to think of this activist as a hedge-fund
activist for example. An activist hedge fund typically accumulates shares of a public
company in the open market and then expends effort to improve the company. Data
on trading strategies of such activist shareholders could provide an interesting testing
ground for the model. We focus on four implications of the model. First, the model

  16
    Of course, with an infinitesimal cost, he might not want to trade at all, leading to a Grossman-
Stiglitz style paradox.


                                                38
predicts that the value created by an activist is increasing in his stake size. The higher
an activist’s stake, the higher effort he will expend and the higher increase in the firm
value will be achieved. Second, the model predicts that the unconditional trading rate is
expected to decrease closer to the terminal date (see Figure 4). Third, the model shows
that an activist’s trading strategy should depend not only on the stock price but also on
his stock ownership. Specifically, the activist’s trading rate is increasing in the size of
his acquired position (see proposition 2). Finally, the model predicts that shareholder
activism should target relatively more liquid stocks.
   We use the novel data-set built by Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2013a) on individual
trades by activist share-holders as identified from so-called 13D SEC filings, to investigate
these implications of our model. We first describe the data succinctly and then describe
the evidence.

4.1. Sample Description

   In this section we describe data used in the empirical analysis. Data are compiled
from several sources. Stock returns, volume, and prices come from the Center for
Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Data on trades by Schedule 13D filers come from
a unique hand-collected database, described below (Detailed description of the sample
is in Collin-Dufresne and Fos, 2013a).
   These authors exploit a disclosure requirement to identify trades that rely on valuable
private information. Rule 13d-1(a) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act requires investors
to file with the SEC within 10 days of acquiring more than 5% of any class of securities
of a publicly traded company if they have an interest in influencing the management of


                                             39
the company. In particular, Item 5(c) of Schedule 13D requires the filer to “... describe
any transactions in the class of securities reported on that were effected during the past
sixty days or since the most recent filing of Schedule 13D, whichever is less.” Thus,
Schedule 13D filings reveal the date and price at which all trades by the Schedule 13D
filer were executed during the 60 days that precede the filing date. For each event we
extract the following information from the Schedule 13D filings: CUSIP of the underlying
security, date of every transaction, transaction type (purchase or sell), transaction size,
and transaction price. In addition, we extract filing date, event date (date of crossing
the 5% threshold), and the beneficial ownership of the Schedule 13D filer at the filing
date.
   The sample of trades by Schedule 13D filers is constructed as follows. First, using
an automatic search script, we identify 19,026 Schedule 13D filings from 1994 to 2010.
We then apply criteria described in Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2013a) and are left with
the final sample of 3,126 Schedule 13D filings from 1994 to 2010.

4.2. Value Creation

   We begin by documenting shareholder activism generates (on average) statistically
and economically significant positive excess returns.       Figure 7 plots the average
buy-and-hold return, in excess of the buy-and-hold return on the value-weighed
NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ index from CRSP, from sixty days prior to the filing date
to forty days afterward. The sample includes data from the 1994 to 2010 sample period.
There is a run-up of about 3% from sixty days to one day prior to the filing date. The
two-day jump in excess return observed at the filing date is around 2.5%. After that


                                            40
Figure 7: Buy-and-Hold Abnormal Return around the Filing Date. In Panel A
the solid line (right axis) plots the average buy-and-hold return around the filing date in
excess of the buy-and-hold return of the value-weighted market from sixty days prior the
filing date to forty days afterwards. The filing date is the day on which a Schedule 13D
filing is submitted to the SEC. The dark bars (left axis) plot the increase (in percentage
points) in the share turnover during the same time window compared to the average
turnover rate during the preceding (t-120, t-60) event window. In Panel B the solid line
plots the daily abnormal return. The abnormal return is the average daily return in
excess of the value-weighted market return. The dashed lines plot the lower and upper
1% confidence bounds.


the excess return remains positive and the post-filing ‘drift’ cumulates to a total of 9%.
Thus, the short-term announcement event-day returns suggest that Schedule 13D filers
indeed possess valuable private information during the pre-announcement period.17

  17
    Please note that neither our model nor any other microstructure model is consistent with the jump
in stock prices upon the announcement. We believe that this empirical regularity is consistent with
activists being risk averse. Generalization of the current model to the case of a risk averse activist is
outside the scope of this paper and is work in progress.



                                                   41
   The dataset reveals that an activist shareholders purchase a significant number of
shares in targeted companies and therefore have strong incentives to increase the value
of their firms. For instance, the average (median) stock ownership of a Schedule 13D filer
on the filing date is 7.51% (6.11%). The average (median) filer purchases 3.8% (2.8%) of
outstanding shares during the sixty-day period prior to the filing date. It corresponds to
an average (median) purchase of 899,692 (298,807) shares at an average (median) cost
of $16.4 ($2.5) million. Such a significant stake creates a strong incentive for the activist
to increase the firm value.
   The model predicts that an activist’s stake size is positively associated with the value
creation. To study this relation, we estimate the following cross-sectional regression:


                                cari = a + bXi + γtoi + εi ,                            (58)


where cari is the cumulative abnormal return between the event date and the filing date,
Xi is the percentage of outstanding shares of company i owned by a Schedule 13D filer
on the filing date, and toi is the average daily turnover between the event date and the
filing date. The daily turnover is defined as the daily volume divided by the number of
outstanding shares. The event date is the day when a Schedule 13D filer’s ownership in
stock i crosses the 5% threshold. The filing date is the day when a Schedule 13D filing
is submitted to the SEC. Table 1 reports the results.

                                   [Insert Table 1 here]

   Table 1 reveals that activist’s stake size is positively associated with cumulative
abnormal returns between the event date and the filing date. For instance, column

                                             42
(1) shows that one standard deviation increase in an activist’s stake size (i.e., 3.5% of
outstanding shares) is associated with a 0.75% increase in cumulative abnormal returns.
Since the average cumulative abnormal return between the event date and the filing
date is 2.6%, the economic magnitude of the effect is significant. We next control for
share turnover in order to rule out the possibility that the positive association between
abnormal returns and an activist’s stake size is driven by share turnover. The evidence
reported in column (3) shows that the positive association between an activist’s stake
size and abnormal returns remains almost unchanged when we control for the daily share
turnover. One concern with this regression is that it does not establish causality. While
the evidence is consistent with activists creating more value when their stake is higher,
it may also simply reflect the fact that activists acquire more shares in companies that
more undervalued (ex ante) as in the original Kyle (1985) model. The next section tests
evidence more specific to the activism model.

4.3. Trading Strategies of Activist Shareholders

       The dataset allows us to test whether trading strategies of activist shareholders are
consistent with the proposed model. As we show in Figure 4, the model predicts that
the unconditional trading rate is expected to decrease as maturity approaches. This is
in contrast to the Kyle (1985) model where, since the terminal value is exogenous, an
activist’s optimal trading intensity is constant.18
       To test whether this feature of the model is supported by data, we plot trading

  18
    Another feature that could explain a decreasing trading intensity is risk-aversion (e.g., Baruch
(2002))



                                                43
Figure 8: Trading Strategy of Schedule 13D Filers. The dark bars plot the average
percentage of outstanding shares purchased by Schedule 13D filers after the event day.
The event date is the day on which activist’s ownership crosses the 5% threshold.


strategies of Schedule 13D filers after the event day. We restrict the analysis to the
post event day period because an activist’s horizon is limited to 10 days after the event
day. That is, an activist has up to 10 days to disclose publicly his beneficial ownership
and intention. It implies that an activist’s ability to select when and how to trade is
limited in this sub-sample (see detailed discussion of this issue in Collin-Dufresne and
Fos, 2013a). Figure 8 plots the average percentage of outstanding shares purchased by
Schedule 13D filers after the event day.
   The plot suggests that an activist’s trading intensity decreases closer to the terminal
date. When we regress the percentage of outstanding shares purchased on a given day


                                           44
on the distance to the terminal date, we find that an activist purchases decrease by
0.02% of outstanding shares on every trading day.19 Since on an average trading day an
activist purchases 0.16% of outstanding shares, the rate at which the trading intensity
decreasing is substantial: it decreases by 12.5% on every trading date. Thus, the evidence
is consistent with the model’s prediction that the unconditional trading rate is expected
to decrease closer to the terminal date.
       An additional testable prediction distinguishes the model from the literature.
Proposition 2 shows that an activist’s trading strategy depends on the activist’s stake
size. This is in contrast to Kyle (1985) and Back (1992), where an activist’s trading
strategy depends on the ‘valuation gap’ (i.e., the difference between exogenously given
terminal value of the stock and the current stock price) and not on the activist’s stake
size. To test whether this prediction is supported by data, we estimate the following
regression for every event:


                                θit = a0i + a1i Xit−1 + a2i Pit + εit ,                            (59)


where θit is the number shares purchased by a Schedule 13D filer in company i on date
t, Xit−1 is the number shares owned by the Schedule 13D filer on date t − 1, and Pit is
the closing price of the stock i on date t. The analysis is based on daily observations
from 60 days before the filing date to the filing date.

  19
    Specifically, we estimate the following regression: wit = α + β(T − t)i + εit , where wit is the
percentage of outstanding shares purchased on day t and (T − t) is the distance to the terminal day
T . The estimate of β is 0.02% with t-stat of 22.52, calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard
errors.



                                                  45
      Consistently with the proposed model, we find that an activist’s trading strategy is
positively associated with the stake size in 97% of events and is negatively associated
with the stock price in 91% of events. The cross-sectional mean of a1 is 4.5 with t-stat
of 41.05. The cross-sectional mean of a2 is -18.4 with t-stat of -14.66. Thus, an activist’s
stock ownership seems to have a significant incremental effect on the activist’s trading
strategy.

4.4. Characteristics of Targeted Companies

      We conclude the empirical analysis by studying characteristics of targeted companies.
In order to perform the analysis, we merge the sample of Schedule 13D filings with CRSP,
Compustat, and Thomson Reuters databases. We begin the analysis from reporting
average levels of firm characteristics in Table 2. Schedule 13D filers are less likely to
target companies with illiquid stocks. In addition, stocks of targeted firms have higher
idiosyncratic volatility, higher proportion of shares owned by institutional investors, and
higher proportion of shares owned by activist hedge funds.20 This evidence is consistent
with the proposed model (see Section 3). In addition, targeted companies have lower
market cap and higher book-to-market ratio when compared to non-targeted companies
(similar evidence is documented by Brav et al., 2008; Klein and Zur, 2009; Fos, 2012).


                                        [Insert Table 2 here]

 20
      We thank Wei Jiang for providing data on beneficial ownership of activist hedge funds.




                                                   46
   We estimate the following linear probability model in order to further investigate
characteristics of Schedule 13D targets:


                           T argetedit = Xit−1 α1 + ζt + ζj + εit ,                      (60)


where T arget is an indicator of firm i being targeted in year t, Xit−1 is the vector of firm
characteristics (defined in Table 2) lagged by one year, ζt are firm fixed effects, and ζj are
industry fixed effects (2-digit SIC). Since the regression includes year and industry fixed
effects, the reported evidence is based on within year and within industry differences in
firm characteristics. Table 3 reports the results.


                                    [Insert Table 3 here]


   Overall, the results are consistent with the univariate analysis with one exception:
the number of years on CRSP is now significantly associated with the likelihood of
a Schedule 13D filing. Specifically, ‘older’ companies are more likely to experience a
Schedule 13D filing. This evidence is consistent with ‘older’ companies being associated
with a more severe agency problem.


5. Conclusion

   We have proposed a model of activist share-holder that extends Kyle (1985) and Back
(1992) to allow for an endogenous liquidation value that is determined by the effort level
chosen by the informed activist. In equilibrium, price impact reflects two sources of
information asymmetry: one related to the insider’s pure informational advantage (his


                                             47
stock-picking ability) as in the original Kyle model, and one that is related to moral
hazard (his share-holder activism).
   We find that while, in equilibrium, prices eventually reveal the total value of the firm,
in many cases, the market cannot identify the actual source of value ‘creation.’ Forcing
activists to disclose information on their position helps in separating stock-pickers from
activists. However, more disclosure also leads to less share-accumulation by the activist
who then exerts less effort and creates less value. Indeed, in general the model shows that
less price efficiency (i.e., higher noise-trading volatility) allows the insider to accumulate
more shares and thus to exert more effort to generate more share-holder value.
   Using a data-set on trades by activist share-holders built from 13D SEC filings
(first used by Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2013a)) we document several stylized facts that
are broadly in line with the predictions of the model. Indeed, we find that the value
created by an activist and his trades are empirically significantly positively related to
his accumulated stake size. We also confirm that activism tends to target stocks that
have both relatively higher trading liquidity and higher idiosyncratic volatility.

Table 1: Value Creation by Activist Shareholders. This table studies value
creation by Schedule 13D filers. We estimate the following cross-sectional regression:
cari = a + bXi + γtoi + εi , where cari is the cumulative abnormal return between the
event date and the filing date, Xi is the percentage of outstanding shares of company i
owned by the Schedule 13D filer on the filing date, and toi is the average daily turnover
between the event date and the filing date (daily volume divided by the number of
shares outstanding). The event date is the day when Schedule 13D filer’s ownership in
stock i crosses 5% threshold and the filing date is the day on which the Schedule 13D
filing is submitted to the SEC. In each column, we report estimated coefficients and
their t-statistics. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%

6. Appendix

6.1. Proof of Lemma 1

   Here we give a heuristic derivation of the filtering equations given in lemma 1 based
on the Gaussian projection theorem, a discrete time approximation of the continuous
time model and taking the limit as the time step dt goes to zero.


      Pt+dt = E v | Y t , Yt+dt
                               

                         Cov(v, Yt+dt − Yt | Y t )
            = E v|Y t +                               (Yt+dt − Yt − E[Yt+dt − Yt | Y t ])
                
                                V (Yt+dt − Yt | Y t )
                                   βΣv dt + γΣXv dt
            = Vt + 2                                              (Yt+dt − Yt )
                   β Σv dt + γ 2 ΣX dt2 + 2βγΣXv dt2 + σ 2 dt
                             2

                   βΣv + γΣXv
            ≈ Vt +                 (dYt ).
                           σ2

The third line uses the fact that the expected change in order flow is E[Yt+dt −Yt | Y t ] = 0
for the conjectured policy. The last line follows from going to the continuous time limit
(with dt2 ≈ 0).
   Thus we also find:
                                           βΣv + γΣXv
                                      λ=
                                               σ2

Similarly, by the projection theorem, we have:


              V ar v | Y t , Yt+dt = V ar v | Y t − (λt )2 V ar Yt+dt − Yt | Y t ,
                                                                           
                                                                                            (61)




                                              55
which gives (when keeping only order dt terms or lower):


                                       Σt+dt ≈ Σt − λ2t σ 2 dt.                                  (62)


    A similar ‘proof’ applies for the optimal filter for Xt .




              Qt+dt = E Xt+dt | Y t , Yt+dt
                                           

                                      Cov(Xt+dt , Yt+dt − Yt | Y t )
                      = E Xt+dt | Y t +
                         
                                                                      (dYt )
                                            V (Yt+dt − Yt | Y t )
                                        βΣXv dt + γΣX dt
                      = Qt + 2                                           dYt
                             β Σv dt + γ 2 ΣX dt2 + 2βγΣXv dt2 + σ 2 dt
                                     2

                             βΣXv + γΣX
                      ≈ Qt +               dYt .
                                   σ2


since


                 E Xt+dt | Y t = E Xt + (β(v − Vt ) + γt (Xt − Qt )) dt | Y t
                                                                           


                                  = Qt


and


Cov(Xt+dt , Yt+dt − Yt | Y t ) = Cov(Xt + (β(v − Vt ) + γt (Xt − Qt )) dt, (β(v − Vt ) + γt (Xt − Qt )) dt | Y t )

                               = βt ΣXv dt + γt ΣX dt + [...]dt2

                               ≈ (βt ΣXv + γt ΣX ) dt.




                                                 56
   We thus obtain:
                                              βΣXv + γΣX
                                         Λ=              .
                                                  σ2

Similarly, we have:


  V ar Xt+dt | Y t , Yt+dt = V ar Xt + βt (v − Vt )dt + γt Xt dt | Y t − Λ2t V ar Yt+dt − Yt | Y t ,
                                                                                             

                                                                                                  (63)

which gives:


                      ΣX (t + dt) ≈ ΣX (t) + 2βt ΣXv dt + 2γt ΣX dt − Λ2t σ 2 dt                  (64)

                                   = ΣX (t) + σ 2 Λ(2 − Λ)dt.                                     (65)


   Lastly, we can compute the covariance between the two filters from:


               Cov Xt+dt , v | Y t , Yt+dt = Cov Xt+dt , v | Y t − λt Λt V ar dY | Y t
                                                                                  
                                                                                                  (66)

                                          ≈ ΣXv + σ 2 λ(1 − Λ)dt.                                 (67)


Since


           Cov Xt+dt , v | Y t = Cov Xt + βt (v − Vt )dt + γt (Xt − Qt )dt, v | Y t
                                                                                 
                                                                                                  (68)

                                   ≈ ΣXv + βΣv dt + γΣXv dt                                       (69)

                                   = ΣXv + σ 2 λdt                                                (70)




                                                  57
6.2. One period Kyle model with moral hazard

   To show our results are not specific to continuous time setup we derive the optimal
trading strategy and equilibrium price dynamics in a simple one-period setup.
   We assume as in the main part of the paper, that the activist is endowed with
an initial number of shares X0 and that he will purchase θ shares in the market by
submitting a market order to the market maker. The market maker will set prices so
as to break even, i.e., such that his expected profits are zero. The market maker only
observes total order flow Y = θ + u where u ∼ N (0, σu2 ) is uninformed noise trading
which we assume to be normally distributed. After the trades are settled, the activist
                                                                w2
can choose his level of activism w by paying a cost C(w) =      2ψ
                                                                   .   As a result of this action
the terminal payoff of the firm is realized and equal to v + w where v is a constant known
only to the activist at date 0.
   We assume the market maker’s initial prior about X0 and v is Gaussian: v ∼
                                2
N (V0 , σv2 ) and X0 ∼ N (Q0 , σQ ) and that their covariance is σXv .
   To summarize the activist’s problem is:


                    max E [(v + w − P1 )θ + (w + v)X0 − C(w)|v, X0 ]                        (71)
                     θ,w



   Because of the assumed timing, the activist’s optimal choice of w will maximize:


                                  max w(θ + X0 ) − C(w),                                    (72)
                                    w




                                              58
With our choice of cost function this leads to:


                                    w∗ = ψ(θ + X0 ).                                (73)


Plugging back into his objective function we see that the activist is maximizing:

                                             ψ(θ + X0 )2
                                                              
                    max E vX0 + (v − P1 )θ +             |v, X0 .                   (74)
                     θ                           2

   We look for a linear equilibrium where price responds linearly to order flow:


                                     P1 = P0 + ∆Y


we obtain (after dropping the constant term and taking expectation):

                                                   ψ(θ + X0 )2
                          max vθ − (P0 + ∆θ)θ +                                     (75)
                            θ                          2

   The FOC w.r.t. θ is:


                            v − P0 − 2∆θ + ψ(θ + X0 ) = 0.                          (76)


Thus:
                                         v − P0 + ψX0
                                  θ∗ =                .                             (77)
                                            2∆ − ψ

We see that the optimal trading strategy (assuming a linear price order flow relation) is




                                            59
linear of the form:


                                   θ = α + βv + γX0                                   (78)
                                           P0
                                   α = −                                              (79)
                                        2∆ − ψ
                                         1
                                   β =                                                (80)
                                       2∆ − ψ
                                         ψ
                                   γ =        ≡ ψβ.                                   (81)
                                       2∆ − ψ

   Next we show that if the trading strategy is linear of the form (78), then the price
order flow relation is indeed linear. Recall that the market maker is risk-neutral and
sets prices such that:


                         P1 = E[v + w | Y ]                                           (82)

                            = E[v + ψ(θ + X0 ) | Y ]

                            = E[ψα + v(1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)X0 ) | Y ]


Using normality of the random variables we obtain:

                                              Cov(v(1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)X0 ), Y )
P1 = E[ψα + v(1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)X0 )] +                                         (Y − E[Y ])
                                                          Var(Y )

   Now, note that


E[ψα + v(1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)X0 )] = ψα + V0 (1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)Q0

Cov(v(1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)X0 ), Y ) = (1 + ψβ)βσv2 + ψ(γ + 1)γσX
                                                             2
                                                               + (γ + ψβ(2γ + 1)) σXv


                                              60
                            Var(Y ) = β 2 σv2 + γ 2 σX
                                                     2
                                                       + 2βγσXv + σu2


Thus we have shown that if the optimal strategy θ is linear then the price-order flow is
indeed linear and of the form P1 = P0 + ∆Y with:

                                              2
                     (1 + ψβ)βσv2 + ψ(γ + 1)γσX + (γ + ψβ(2γ + 1)) σXv
                ∆=                         2
                                                                                   (83)
                                 β σv + γ σX + 2βγσXv + σu2
                                  2 2    2



and
               P0 = ψα + V0 (1 + ψβ) + ψ(γ + 1)Q0 ) − ∆(α + βV0 + γQ0 )            (84)

   It remains to find the fixed point solution to the system of equations          (79),
(80), (81), (83), (84), if it exists.
   Using γ = ψβ and defining ω 2 ≡ σv2 + 2ψσXv + ψ 2 σX
                                                      2
                                                        we obtain:

                                             βω 2 (1 + ψβ)
                                        ∆=                  .                      (85)
                                              β 2 ω 2 + σu2

   From equation (80) we obtain 2β∆ = 1 + βψ. After substituting it in equation (85)
we find:
                                                  σu
                                             β=      .                             (86)
                                                  ω

Then we immediately obtain:

                                                 
                                        1      ω
                                    ∆ =     ψ+                                     (87)
                                        2      σu
                                        ψσu
                                    γ =                                            (88)
                                          ω
                                    P0 = V0 + ψQ0                                  (89)

                                                61
                                        α = −βP0                                         (90)


Note that, as in the continuous time solution we obtain θ = β(v + ψX0 − P0 ) and
E[θ∗ ] = 0. Further, similarly to the continuous time solution we see that the total price
impact is increasing in the productivity of the activist (ψ) as well as in the signal to
              ω
noise ratio   σu
                 ,   which implies that it is increasing in the uncertainty about his position
(σX ).
