        Our study is the first study that addresses the impact of collective bargaining coverage on salaries
in academia for employees other than faculty. We use data from a 1997-98 study on the costs of staffing
in higher education conducted by the Association of Higher Education Facilities Officers and other
sources to estimate the impact of staff unions on staff salaries in American higher education. Our best
estimate is that for the occupations in our sample, collective bargaining coverage raises staff salaries by
at most 10 to 20 percent relative to the salaries of comparable higher education employees not covered
by union contracts.

I. Introduction

        In 2001, a twenty-day sit-in at Harvard University brought the living-wage debate

to the forefront of American consciousness. After a six-month study, the Harvard

Committee on Employment and Contracting Policies, a 19 member committee of faculty,

staff, administrators and students that had been appointed by Harvard’s president as a

result of the discussions to end the sit-in, recommended giving raises to the university’s

lowest paid employees and relying more on collective bargaining in the future to assure

that the wages paid by subcontractors did not undercut local union wage scales.1 A three-

day sit-in at the University of Connecticut that related to the living wage issue also

yielded a substantive victory for campus workers. The protesters there generated an

almost two-dollar increase in wages, as well as substantial improvement in benefits for

many of the university’s workers.2 Collectively these struggles represent a new

battleground in American higher education.

        The growth of living wage movements on almost one hundred campuses reflects

the large variation in the wages paid to college and university staff across the country.3

There are many potential explanations for these salary differences, including differences

in local cost of living and differences in the resources that the academic institutions have

available to pay faculty and staff salaries. One other possible explanation is the influence

of staff unions. Previous studies of the impact of unions on salaries in academia have

focused on faculty unions and have concluded that faculty unions have increased the

salaries of their members relative to the salaries of faculty at academic institutions in

which faculty are not covered by collective bargaining agreements by at best a small

percentage amount.4 There have been no studies, however, of the impact of collective

bargaining on staff salaries in higher education.

        Our paper addresses this issue. After providing some background data on the

number of blue-collar and white-collar employees covered by collective bargaining

agreements at American higher education institutions, we use data from a 1997-1998

study on the costs of staffing in higher education conducted by the Association of Higher

Education Facilities Officers (APPA) and other sources to estimate models that explain

the variation in academic institutions’ salaries for a number of narrowly defined blue

collar and white collar occupational groups that are employed by the academic

institutions’ facilities divisions.5 Of primary interest to us, is the extent to which the

salaries of academic staff covered by collective bargaining agreements exceed the

salaries of otherwise comparable academic staff that are not covered by such agreements.

II. Background Data

        Table 1 presents data on the employment levels of blue-collar and white-collar

staff members employed in American higher education in the mid 1990s, as well as the

percentage of each group that was covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The

percentage of blue-collar employees represented by staff unions, 42.8%, is much larger

than the percentage of white-collar employees, 23.4%, represented by staff unions.

Because there are many more white-collar employees, in the aggregate about 27.7% of

found in other studies,

staff at American colleges and universities were covered by union contracts in the mid

1990s.

         The salary and collective bargaining coverage data used in our study come from

the APPA’s 1997-1998 Comparative Costs and Staffing Report for College and

University Faculties.6 This data set provided information on salary levels and collective

bargaining coverage for 47 narrowly defined occupations at 193 American and Canadian

colleges, universities and elementary and secondary schools. We restricted our attention

to American higher education institutions that could be classified as Research, Doctoral,

Masters, Baccalaureate, or Associate (2-year) institutions.7 The sample that we used

ultimately consisted of 163 institutions

         Table 2 presents the breakdown of the institutions in our sample by Carnegie

classification and by form of control. Public institutions constitute the majority of the

institutions in each Carnegie category in our sample, except for the Baccalaureate

category.

         We restrict our attention to the 9 occupations for which at least 115 institutions in

the sample reported both an occupational salary level and whether the employees in the

occupation were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Table 3 shows the

difference in the mean annual salaries of unionized and non-unionized employees for

each occupation, as well as the ratio of the mean salary in an occupation for employees

that were covered by union contracts to the mean salary in an occupation for employees

that were not covered by a union contract. In each occupation, employees covered by a

union contract earned considerably more than employees not covered by a contract, with

the raw differentials in the means salaries varying across occupations from 23 to 42

percent. The differentials were largest in the skilled trades. Salaries for custodial workers,

the group of employees that have been the focus of the living wage debate on many

campuses were the lowest in the group and the unionized custodial workers in the sample

earned about 35 percent more on average than custodial workers at academic institutions

that were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

III. Estimating the Union/Nonunion Salary Advantage of Unionized Academic Staff

        The estimated differences in the salaries of academic staff covered by and not

covered by union contracts reported in table 3 are raw differences that do not control for

characteristics of the institutions, or the areas in which the institutions are located, that

might be expected to influence staff salaries independent of unionization. For example, if

academic institutions whose employees were organized also had greater financial

resources, or were located in higher cost of living areas, than institutions whose

employees were not organized, one would expect to observe the former paying higher

salaries than the latter, even if unionization per se had no effect on the salaries of staff at

academic institutions. To estimate, whether staff unions to influence salaries, it is

necessary to control for the other characteristics of the institutions that might be expected

to influence salaries.

        To accomplish this, we estimate staff salary equations, by occupation, of the

form:

        Log (Wi) = a0 + a1Ui + a2Yi + a3Zi + ei




                                               4
         In the equation Wi is the annual salary paid to a staff member in an occupation at

the academic institution, Ui is a categorical variable indicating whether the particular

occupation is unionized at the institution, Yi is a vector of categorical variables indicating

the Carnegie classification of the institution (two-year colleges are the omitted category),

Zi is a vector of other variables that vary across institutions and are expected to influence

staff salaries, and the ei are random error terms. Because the dependent variable is the

logarithm of salaries, the interpretation of the estimate of the coefficient a1 is that it is the

estimated percentage by which the salaries of staff in institutions with collective

bargaining for the occupation exceed the salaries of staff at institutions without collective

bargaining for the occupation, after controlling for the other factors expected to influence

salaries.8

         We include in the Yi a set of variables that influence the resources that the

academic institutions have at their command out of which to pay the salaries of staff.

These include the logarithm of the institution’s endowment per student (LENDOW), the

logarithm of its average undergraduate tuition (LTUIT) and, for public institutions, the

logarithm of its state and local government appropriation per student (LAPP).9 In our

basic specification, we also include the logarithm of the average salary that the institution

pays its full professors (LSAL), under the assumption that this probably represents the

best single measure of the financial capacity of the institution. Also included in this

vector, to control for differences in cost of living or wage levels across areas, is the



                                                                                     a
8
  More precisely, the estimated union/nonunion salary differential is given by ( e 1 – 1)(100)
9
  For public institutions this is a weighted average of its in-state and out-of-state tuitions, with the weights
depending upon the fraction of its students that come from each category.


                                                        5
logarithm of the mean salary of custodians in the city in which the academic institution is

located (LMEAN). When an institution was not located in a city for which we had mean

custodian salary data, the mean custodian wage in the state was substituted. Finally,

included in this vector is the logarithm of the average math and verbal SAT 75th

percentile score for entering freshmen at the institution (LSAT). This variable, as well as

the Carnegie category variables were included to see if the “selectivity” of an academic

institution, or its institutional type, influences the salary of its staff, once we have

controlled for its financial resources.

        Table 4 presents the estimates of our logarithm of occupational salary equations.

Looking first at the effect of being covered by a collective bargaining contract on the

salary of staff, for 6 of the 9 occupations union coverage is associated, other factors held

constant, with higher salaries, with the estimated differentials being in the range of 10 to

17 percent. The differentials are the largest for several of the occupations that historically

have been heavily unionized nationwide in the building trades. Relevant to the living

wage debate, we do observe that unionized custodians appear to earn about 10 percent

more than nonunionized custodians at academic institutions, other factors held constant

        Turning next to the financial variables, staff members’ salaries are clearly

strongly related to the proxy for the cost of living or alternative wages in the area. For

most occupations, one cannot reject the hypothesis that a 1 percent increase in the

average wage of custodians in the area is associated with a 1 percent increase in the

academic staff members’ salaries.

        Salaries of staff members at American colleges and universities are also clearly

related to the salaries paid to full professors employed at their institutions. Interestingly,




                                                6
the magnitude of the relationship appears to be strongest for the one white-collar

occupation represented in our sample, administrative secretary. Once we control for the

salaries paid to full professors, we find little evidence that knowledge of the financial

picture facing the institution, as measured by its endowment per student, its average

tuition level or, for publics, its per student state and local government appropriation level,

influence its staff members’ salaries10

         Other factors held constant, including the financial and unionization variables, for

several categories of staff, the Carnegie category of the institution in which they are

employed is a statistically significant determinant of their salaries. In particular,

administrative secretaries, custodial employees, and locksmiths employed at 2-year

institutions appear to earn 12 to 25 percent more than their counterparts who are

employed at baccalaureate, masters, doctoral or research institutions. Put perhaps another

way, 2-year institutions appear to be the least elitist; the faculty/staff salary differential is

lowest at these institutions.11 Finally, the selectivity of an institution’s undergraduate

students, as measured by their SAT scores, is not related to the salaries of staff in these

occupations.



IV. Testing for the Sensitivity of Our Findings to Alternative Specifications

         Our primary concern is the effect of unionization of staff employees at academic

institutions on the salaries of those staff employees. Table 5 summarizes the results of


10
   As we indicate in the next section, we also estimated models that excluded the logarithm of full
professors’ average salary. However, in these models the measures we included of the institutions’
financial wealth- endowment per student, tuition and state and local appropriations per student - again
never proved to be positively related to the salaries of staff in an occupation
11
   For the other occupations, two-year colleges also appear to pay higher salaries, ceteris paribus, than the
other categories of institutions but the estimated differentials are usually not statistically significantly
different from zero.


                                                       7
additional econometric modeling we conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the

estimated union coefficient to the variables included in the analyses and to the

econometric methods we utilized. Row A of table 5 simply repeats the estimated union

coefficients that are reported in table 4.

        A key explanatory variable underlying table 4 was the logarithm of the average

salary of full professors at the institution. One can easily argue that this variable should

be treated as endogenous and that including it in the model may bias the estimated union

coefficient. To see if the inclusion of the full professor salary variable mattered, we

reestimated our equation excluding this variable from the analyses and the estimated

union coefficients are found in row B of table 5. The exclusion of the full professor

salary variable from the right-hand side of the equation leads to slightly higher estimated

union/nonunion differentials, with the statistically significant coefficients now ranging

from 13 to 21 percent.

        The estimates presented in table 4 treat each occupational equation as

independent. They ignore the fact that there may be some omitted institutional level

variables that influence the salaries of staff commonly in all occupations. For example,

the union/nonunion wage advantage for an occupation at an institution may depend upon

the fraction of the other staff occupations at an institution that are covered by collective

bargaining agreements. Hence the wages any given staff occupation at an academic

institution may depend upon the unionization of all staff occupations at the institution.

        We attempted to reestimate the models underlying table 4, adding as an additional

explanatory variable the fraction of all 9 occupations that were covered by collective




                                              8
bargaining agreements.12 Unfortunately, when 1 of the 9 occupations was covered by a

contract, the vast majority of the other occupations also were covered by a contract.

Hence the coverage by union contract variable for an occupation was very highly

correlated with the fraction of the 9 occupations at the institution that were covered by

union contracts. The high degree of collinearity prevented us from estimating such a

model.

         A second way to get at this issue is simply to treat the 9 occupational salary

equations as a single system and to allow the error terms to be correlated across

equations. Estimating this system using the method of seemingly unrelated regressions

will increase the efficiency of our estimates, however, as long as none of the other

statistical assumption was violated, the estimates reported in table 4 would remain

unbiased.13

         The method of seemingly unrelated regressions will increase the efficiency of the

estimated coefficients only if the identical explanatory variables do not appear in each

equation. In our system, the only explanatory variable that varies across occupations is

whether employees in an occupation are covered by a collective bargaining agreement at

an institution. We have already indicated that the fraction of occupations organized at an

institution is highly correlated with whether any one of the occupations is organized

across institutions. Given this fact, it is not surprising that the estimated union

coefficients that we obtained when we reestimated the model by seemingly unrelated

regressions (these estimates found in row C of table 5); the estimated prove to be very

similar to the coefficients found in row A of the table. Any differences are probably due

12
   Ehrenberg and Goldstein (1975) followed a similar procedure in their study of the impact of public
sector unions on the wages of different occupational categories of public employees.
13
   The seemingly unrelated regression model was developed by Arnold Zellner (1962)


                                                    9
to sampling error since the seemingly unrelated regression model could only be estimated

using data on the subset of institutions that reported occupational salary and unionization

data for all 9 occupations.

         Finally, our estimates of the salary advantage that staff who work in unionized

academic environments have over staff who work in nonunion academic environments

treats staff coverage by a collective bargaining agreement as being exogenous. If, for

example, the institutions in which we observe staff covered by a collective bargaining

agreement were initially the institutions in which staff compensation was lowest, other

factors held constant, our estimates will understate the extent to which academic staff

unions have improved their members compensation relative to the compensation of

academic staff at institutions not covered by collective bargaining agreements.

         In the absence of having a panel data set that would permit us to estimate how

changes in staff salaries at academic institutions are related to changes in collective

bargaining coverage, there are two ways to handle this problem. The first is to obtain an

instrument for the presence of a union contract and to reestimate our basic model using

the method of instrumental variables. We obtained an instrument for collective

bargaining for a staff occupation at an institution by regressing this variable on all of the

other variables found on the right hand side of the salary equations, as well the

proportions of private and public employees in the institution’s state covered by collected

bargaining agreements, each interacted with a dichotomous variable indicating whether

the institution was a public or private institution.14


14
  The latter four variables are included to allow both public and private collective bargaining coverage in
the state to influence whether the occupation at an academic institution was covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, but to allow the importance of each of these variables to depend upon whether the
institution was a public or a private institution.


                                                     10
         The estimated union coverage coefficients that we obtained using this

methodology are found in row D of table 5. All of the estimated union coefficients are

now statistically significantly different from zero and their magnitudes have increased.

Indeed, on balance they are now very close to the raw differences in the salaries of

unionized and nonunionized staff in these occupations that are found in table 3. The

implication of this result is that those academic institutions in which staff in these

occupations have been organized were, on balance, among the lower paying academic

institutions, other factors held constant, at the time that they were first organized

         The second is to use the sample selection bias correction method developed by

James Heckman (1979) and Lung-fei Lee (1978). To implement this method, we estimate

a probit equation for union coverage in an occupation in which union coverage is

assumed to be a function of the variables discussed above.15 The estimates of this

equation allow us to compute an estimate of the inverse mills ratio for each observation,

this is added as an additional explanatory variable to equation and equation (1) is then

reestimated. Inclusion of this estimated inverse mills ratio in the model controls for the

nonrandom nature of union coverage.

         The estimated union coefficients that we obtained when the sample selection bias

correction method was used are found in row E of table 5. In most cases these estimates

prove to be very similar to the OLS estimates reported in row A. The estimated union

coefficients for carpenters, electricians, heating and cooling technicians, painters and

plumbers remain statistically significant and each coefficient is close to its value in the

OLS equations. The estimated union coefficients for secretaries, groundskeepers and


15

                                                    11
locksmiths are statistically insignificantly different from zero, as they were in the OLS

estimation. While custodians’ salaries appeared to be higher when they were covered by a

collective bargaining contract in the OLS specification, the selectivity corrected estimate

of the effects of unions on custodians’ salaries is close to zero.



V. Concluding Remarks

       Our paper has provided an initial effort at estimating the effect of collective

bargaining coverage on the salaries of staff members at American higher education

institutions. When we treated collective bargaining coverage as exogenous, we obtain

estimated union/nonunion salary differentials that are in the range of 10 to 17 percent for

the occupations in our sample. When we remove full professor salaries from the set of

control variables used in the model, these differentials increase by about 3 percentage

points. When we treat collective bargaining coverage as endogenous and estimate the

union/nonunion differential using an instrumental variable approach, the differentials rise

to the 15 to 40 percent range, which is roughly what the unadjusted mean differences

were in the sample in the salaries of staff covered and not covered by collective

bargaining agreements. However, these latter estimates are a good deal higher than

previous estimates of the impact of unions on their members’ relative salaries, either for

the economy as a whole or for the public sector and when we instead use a sample

selection bias model to correct for the endogenity of union coverage, estimates close to

the OLS estimates are obtained for most occupations.

       The limitations of our study should be kept in mind. The sample of 163 academic

institutions used in our study is not necessarily representative of the population of over




                                              12
3000 2- and 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. The 9 occupations

whose salaries we analyze all relate to employees employed in the facilities division of

America’s colleges and universities and the effects that we estimate for them are not

necessarily representative of the effects for staff unions that one might observe for a

wider range of college and university staff employed in other areas (for example, housing

and dining, athletics, academic support, student services, external relations).

           Nonetheless our study does suggest that collective bargaining coverage does

influence staff salaries in higher education. The National Labor Relations Act governs

collective bargaining for staff of private academic institutions, while state public

employee bargaining laws govern collective bargaining for staff at public academic

institutions. While student and faculty activists on campuses around the country may

continue to press academic institutions to pay living wages to their lower paid staff,

including custodial staff, our findings suggest that a more direct way to achieve better

salaries for low-paid college and university employees is to encourage them to organize

and bargain collectively. Unlike private college and university faculty members, who are

effectively precluded from collective bargaining at many institutions because of the

Supreme Courts decision in the Yeshiva case, there is no such prohibition to prevent staff

at these institutions from organizing.16

           Our study also suggested that other factors held constant, including the proxy for

area cost-of-living and area wage levels and collective bargaining coverage, that there is

no evidence that more financially well-off academic institutions pay their staff higher

salaries. Whether public pressure can be effectively brought to bear on a wider range of

academic institutions that have the financial resources to improve their staff salaries if
