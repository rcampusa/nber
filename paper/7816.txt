       THE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION, 1991-1996: PRODUCTIVE INEFFICIENCY,
                  EXPECTED OUTCOME VARIATIONS, AND PRICE INDEXES

                                  by Ernst R. Berndt, Anupa Bir, Susan H. Busch,
                                  Richard G. Frank and Sharon-Lise T. Normand



I.            Introduction

              Spending on mental health services continued to grow at rates above changes in general prices in the

1990s.1 A common perception is that these increases in mental health spending predominantly reflect increasing

costs of treatment.2   But are increased mental health expenditures due to price increases, quantity (volume)

increases, or some combination? This question raises fundamental issues concerning the value of services as well

as important measurement issues.

              Recently researchers and health care policy analysts have renewed professional interest in

constructing price indexes for episodes of treatment for an illness, rather than focusing measurements on changing

medical care input prices. By pricing episodes of care, the overall cost impacts of changing treatment modalities

can be taken into account, incorporating therapeutic substitution among inputs, technological progress, and the

effects of cost containment policies.3 Whether pricing episodes of care rather than medical care input prices

results in greater or less measured inflation is unclear. In a series of studies covering between eight and sixteen

representative medical conditions treated at the Palo Alto Medical Center from 1954 to 1981, Scitovsky found that

an aggregate of costs per episode of treatment across illnesses increased more rapidly than the BLS medical care

consumer price index (CPI) from 1951 to 1964, and again from 1964 to 1971. Between 1971 and 1981, however,

the difference between the two series was insignificant.4 Scitovsky noted that one drawback of her cost of illness

calculations, as well as of the BLS' medical care price indexes, is that neither adequately accounts for quality

change, and related changes in health outcomes.5

              Using data on heart attack treatments from 1983 to 1994 that explicitly take into account changing

mortality outcomes, Cutler et al. report that treatment price indexes increased substantially less rapidly than an

input price index similar to the medical care CPI (2.3% vs. 6.7% per year), and that over this time period the real

cost of treatment for heart attacks actually fell 1.1% annually. 6

              In another set of studies, Shapiro et al. constructed price indexes for cataract surgery, 1969-93, and

found that over this time interval a CPI-like input price index increased by a factor of nine, while a preferred

                                                                                                                  2

alternative price index incorporating realized reduced levels of hospital services increased by only a factor of

three.7 However, neither of the Shapiro et al. indexes incorporated widely-heralded improvements in the quality

of medical outcomes from cataract surgery.

             Berndt, Busch and Frank (2000) constructed price indexes for the treatment of acute phase

depression, 1991-95.8 As a first step to control for quality of care and outcomes, they limited the analysis to those

episodes of treatment that adhered to depression treatment guidelines published by the Agency for Health Care

Policy Research (AHCPR) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA).9 Using a strict interpretation of

these treatment guidelines, they found that only about 23% of observed depression treatment episodes could be

included in the price index calculations, whereas when a less stringent interpretation of guidelines was employed,

about 50% of the observed episodes were included. Moreover, over the 1991-95 time period, with the strict

interpretation, nominal treatment price indexes fell by about 30%, whereas with the broader interpretation, they

fell by about 3%.10

             This use of published treatment guidelines as a proxy measure for quality of care and expected

outcomes may be preferable to ignoring outcome variations altogether, but it imposes a strong restriction on the

shape of the medical treatment production function.       Use of the guideline criterion implies that simply by

observing input quantity combinations, one assigns each observed treatment episode either a zero (not compatible,

not effective) or a one (guideline compatible, satisfactory outcome and equal across all guideline compatible

treatments). Thus the implicit depression treatment production function is a step function, with a single step.

Moreover, by focusing only on those episodes meeting guideline treatment standards, 50-75% of delivered care is

overlooked. Finally, use of the step function production relationship is very simplistic, and does not make use of a

great deal of clinical and medical knowledge.

             In this paper we report on results of several significant extensions to previous research on price

indexes for the treatment of depression. Although we continue here to study the acute phase outpatient treatment

of depression, we extend the time series to include 1996. More importantly, however, we now combine data from

a large retrospective medical claims data base (MarketScanTM, from The MedStat Group) with clinical literature

and expert clinical opinion elicited from a two-stage modified Delphi procedure. This enables us to construct a

variety of treatment price indexes that include variations over time in the proportion of "off-frontier" production,



                                                                                                                   3

as well as the corresponding variations in expected treatment outcomes.11 We also incorporate the fact that the no

treatment option (“watchful waiting”, or “waiting list”) frequently results in spontaneous remission of depressive

symptoms. We therefore focus on the incremental gains in outcome obtained from treatment over and above

waiting list. By integrating knowledge concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of alternative treatments based

on micro clinical trial data with the judgments of clinical experts and changes in treatment patterns observed in a

large medical claims data base, we construct price indexes that capture the system-wide effects of changing

treatment practice.12

II.           Depression and Its Alternative Treatments

              According to the APA, major depression is diagnosed when a very specific set of clinical criteria

have been met; details concerning these criteria have been discussed elsewhere.13 The 12-month prevalence of

major depression in the U.S. has been estimated at about 10%, and is about twice as high for women as men.14

Although a single episode of the illness is self-explanatory given the diagnostic criteria, recurrent depression is

defined by two or more major depressive episodes each separated by at least eight weeks of return to usual

functioning.15 Episodes of depressive illness come and go, last from several weeks to several months, and are

often followed by periods of relatively normal mood and behavior. Untreated, the average depressive episode

lasts from four to six months, although spontaneous remission is common. Between 20% and 35% of episodes of

depression display persistent symptoms, and when these persistent symptoms last for 24 or more months, these

cases are referred to as chronic depression. Approximately 50% of all people having a depressive episode can be

expected to have a recurrence, usually within two or three years. Once an individual has a second episode,

additional recurrence is 70% likely.

              The acute phase treatment of major depression typically aims at the stabilization of most acute

symptoms, usually over a 12-16 week period. Here we focus on the acute phase, for which there have been rapid

advances in both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatments.16          New psychotherapy treatments include

interpersonal therapy, behavior therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy. In pharmacotherapy, the monoamine

oxidase inhibitors and the cyclic antidepressants of the 1950's to 1970's (including the widely used tricyclics,

TCAs) have now been largely replaced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac, Zoloft

and Paxil. Based on clinical trials, the efficacy of the SSRIs has been shown to be about the same as that of the



                                                                                                                 4
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




older TCAs for mild to moderate depression. However, since the SSRIs are associated with lower risk of

overdose and are generally more easily tolerated by patients, in the naturalistic setting in the U.S., SSRIs typically

dominate the TCAs as first line therapy.17 The advantages of the SSRIs come at a significantly higher pecuniary

cost than most TCAs.        In practice, combination treatments involving psychotherapy plus antidepressant

medications, in varying proportions, constitute a very common treatment strategy.

              As in previous studies of treatment for depression, we identify outpatient treatment episodes for

depression using retrospective claims data from the publicly available MarketScanTM database. These data

consists of 1991-96 medical claims from four large self-insured employers that offered more than 25 health plans

to an average of 426,000 employees and their dependents. We identify all ambulatory claims associated with

either single or recurrent episodes of depression, as defined by the ICD-9 primary diagnostic codes 296.2x or

296.3x.18 We construct episodes of care that include all treatments given in the sixteen weeks following initiation

of care for depression, with distinct episodes defined in terms of eight or more week gaps in care (including gaps

in prescription drug supply).

              We classify each episode of care along two dimensions: type of treatment, and type of patient.

Treatment types are identified using current procedural (CPT-4) codes, drug claim and billing information

contained in the medical claims, and are classified according to type and frequency (pharmacotherapy with TCAs,

SSRIs, etc., psychotherapy, office visits, medical management visits, and various combinations of these).19

Patients are characterized by medically relevant demographic (age, gender) and illness characteristics (history of

substance abuse, presence of medical comorbidity, etc.), and whether the ambulatory practice setting where

treatment was delivered was a specialty mental health or general medical setting.                An example of a

treatment/patient cell is women between ages 18 to 45, with no medical comorbid conditions and no recent

substance abuse problems, treated with an SSRI for at least 60 days plus three or more psychotherapy visits in a

specialty mental health setting over a 16-week period.

              To eliminate the most severe cases in the data, and because information on care received in hospitals

is incomplete, we exclude all depressive episodes involving inpatient (hospital) claims. Since the claims data end

in December 1996, we eliminate both right-censored (new episodes initiated after August 31, 1996) and left-

censored (treatments underway in the first eight weeks of 1991) episodes. This leaves us with 13,098 episodes of



                                                                                                                    5
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




care. Based on these criteria, we identify about 200 patient-treatment cells. To reduce the burden of the expert

panel's deliberations, we eliminate most of the treatment/patient cells having fewer than 30 patients over the six

years. This results in 120 treatment/patient cells covering 9,054 episodes (69% of ambulatory treatment episodes).

Although 867 patient visits involved an ICD-9 depression diagnosis, their medical claims contained no

information on any mental health treatment (n = 816) or there were no expenditures (n = 51). When these "no

treatment" episodes are deleted, the number of remaining episodes is 8,187.

              Direct medical spending for each treatment episode was calculated using actual transactions data.

All payments made by the insurer to the provider, and any cost-sharing assigned to the patient (e.g., patient out of

pocket copayment for psychotherapy and prescription drugs) were summed into a nominal dollar total for each

treatment episode.

III.          Outcomes Assessment: The Expert Panel

              To obtain expected outcome assessments for each of the 120 treatment/patient cells, we combined

research data on clinical efficacy and effectiveness with expert clinical opinion, using a two-stage modified Delphi

method.20 Here we summarize the outcome assessment process; additional details of the methods employed are

given in Normand et al. [1999].

              Predictive distributions of outcomes for hypothetical cohorts of 100 patients receiving a range of

treatments were obtained from a panel of ten experts; this resulted in ten distinct probability distributions for each

of the 120 treatment/patient cells.21 Expected treatment outcomes were characterized in terms of changes in the

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score, a commonly employed clinical measure quantifying symptoms

of depression 16 weeks after entry into treatment for hypothetical cohorts of 100 patients. Standard cutpoints

were used to describe the distribution of treatment outcomes: HDRS < 8 representing no depression (full

remission); 8 ≤ HDRS ≤ 12, mild depression; 13 ≤ HDRS ≤ 17, moderate depression; and HDRS ≥ 18, major

depression (no change). Panelists were instructed to assume that at the time patients initiated treatment, their

HDRS score was 22 (high likelihood of a major depressive disorder diagnosis).

              The elicitation process consisted of three distinct stages. Previous literature has called such a

process a modified Delphi technique. 22       Similar elicitation processes have been used extensively in the

construction of practice guidelines by health services researchers.23



                                                                                                                    6
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




              In the first stage of the Delphi process, based on a 1975-1998 MEDLINE literature review, a

psychiatrist provided each panelist a summary of published results of treatment efficacy and effectiveness for each

of the 120 treatment/patient cells, thereby generating an evidentiary platform for elicitation. This literature review

also examined outcome evidence from the "no active treatment" or "waiting list" treatment option. Since placebo

treatment in clinical trials typically involves a substantial volume of brief counseling sessions and thereby

frequently results in large placebo effects, outcomes evidence on the "waiting list" vs. placebo treatment was

reported when available.

              In the second stage, the results of the literature review were used in a postal elicitation of outcome

distributions (no, mild, moderate or major depression after 16 weeks of treatment) for each of the 120

treatment/patient cells. Experts were directed:

              "Using your best clinical judgment, consider an average group of 100 patients

              presenting with major depressive disorder with an entry HDRS score of 22

              in 1998 to an average specialty mental health or primary care physician.

              After 16 weeks of the indicated treatment, how many patients will most

              likely fall into each of the following categories: depression-free, mildly

              depressed, moderately depressed, or no change. When completing the

              survey, please keep in mind the impact of compliance and the average

              circumstances of routine practice on symptom reductions.”

This postal elicitation yielded 480 parameters from each expert (four parameters, only three of which were

independent due to the 100% adding-up identity, for each of the 120 treatment/patient cells). Cells having a

"substantial" disagreement among experts were identified (coefficient of variation > 0.5). At the end of this

second stage, discordant judgments occurred in 47 of the 120 (39%) of the cells. Disagreement tended to occur

disproportionately in those treatment cells for which the number of published studies was small.

              In the third stage, re-elicitation occurred, with the goal of creating an opportunity for experts to

modify their subjective probability assessments but not forcing group consensus. A face-to-face panel meeting

was convened in January 1999, and each expert was given the groups' rating distribution for each discordant cell

(as well as his/her own probability assessment, but with each expert blinded to what his/her colleagues reported



                                                                                                                    7

individually). After literature review and group discussions, each panelist revised opinions for discordant cells

confidentially. No substantial disagreements (coefficient of variation > 0.5) remained after this re-elicitation.

               The revised probability assessments for the discordant strata were then combined with the initial

assessments for the non-discordant data. The panelists' distributions were summarized and combined using

arithmetic means, medians and other summary distribution measures across the ten expert raters.

IV.            Results: Costs and Expected Outcomes

               Because the elicitation process involved the distribution of outcomes for each patient/treatment cell,

one can examine different cutpoint outcomes. Full remission is defined as an HDRS score of < 8, while "partial

remission" (HDRS ≤ 12) represents a roughly 50% improvement by treatment week 16 after an initial HDRS

score of 22.

               The weighted average of the median outcome result from the expert panel elicitation process for

each treatment (averaged over patient type), as well as 1991-1996 average spending from the MedStat data, are

reported in Table 1.24 Also reported in Table 1 are the incremental costs per depression free case and per case of

50% improvement. The relevant increment is the likelihood of being depression free (or 50% improved) relative

to the “waiting list” outcome. A number of findings are particularly noteworthy.

               First, as seen in the column "Median Probability of No Depression" (i.e., full remission), according

to the expert panel, the probability of a full remission after 16 weeks of treatment ranges from 0.15 to 0.35, with

the lowest 0.15 probability associated with no treatment ("waiting list"), while the 0.34 - 0.35 highest probabilities

are combinations of 60 days of SSRIs plus ≥ 4 psychotherapy (PT) visits, and additional treatments involving

anxiolytics, trazodone and TCAs with greater psychotherapy visits. Interestingly, 10-24 PT visits with no drug

therapy has almost the same probability of full remission as 60 days of SSRIs plus ≥ 4 PT visits (0.34 vs. 0.35).

The results for 50% improvement are consistent with this finding (0.63 and 0.64).              Thus to a first order

approximation, these two alternative treatment modalities are essentially on the same medical production function

isoquant.   Also, the marginal expected benefit when ≤ 30 days' SSRI is augmented by 1-3 PT visits vs. no PT

visits is almost nil (0.28 vs. 0.29), for the difference in the probability of a full remission is zero. For the

probability of 50% improvement the increase in expected outcome from adding visits is also very small, from 0.45

to 0.46. This suggests the possibility that the addition of 1-3 PT visits to ≤ 30 days’ SSRI represents a productive



                                                                                                                    8
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




inefficiency.

                Second, the probability of a partial remission (≥50% improvement in HDRS) is typically about twice

as large as the probability of a full remission after 16 weeks of treatment. As seen in Table 1, the "no mental

health treatment" probability of attaining a partial remission is 0.34, the same as that for one psychotherapy visit,

and only slightly smaller than 1-2 office visits (0.35 - 0.36) that involved no psychotherapy.

                Third, about 40% of the treatment episodes involve medical treatments with little or no incremental

effectiveness over “waiting list” (probability of full remission 0.15 - 0.17). Though not shown in Table 1, we find

that these treatment episodes accounted for about 20% of all spending on treatments.

                Fourth, as seen in the "Average Cost per Episode" column of Table 1, if one looks only at the mean

spending per depressive episode and ignores outcome variations entirely, the spending per case varies from zero

(no treatment) and $53 (one office visit, but no PT) to a high of $1,167 (60 days’ SSRI, trazadone and PT).

Moreover, the cost per episode when treatment consists of 10-24 PT visits and no medication is virtually identical

to the cost per case with 60 days' SSRIs plus ≥4 PT visits ($1055 vs. $1050).

                Fifth, if, however, one defines the output of treatment for depression to be the expected probability

of full remission over and above that obtained from doing nothing, then one can compute the average spending per

incremental remission. Results from such incremental calculations, done separately for full and 50% remissions,

are given in the last two columns of Table 1. Average spending per incremental full remission is infinite for those

treatments no better than the "waiting list" or "no active treatment" outcomes (e.g., 1-2 office visits, antipsychotics

alone), are above $10,000 for 1 PT visit, SSRIs and trazodone ≤ 30 days along with anxiolytics and PT, and for

lithium alone. The lowest costs per incremental full remission are associated with (i) SSRI > 30 days, with an

anxiolytic but no PT, $1,853; (ii) SSRI > 30 days and no PT, $2,367; (iii) 1 brief office visit $2,618; (iv) SSRI >

30 days, anxiolytic, 1-3 PT visits, $2,765; and (v) SSRI < 30 days and no PT, $3,447. As seen in the bottom row

of Table 1, averaged over all cases over the 1991-96 time period, the cost per episode is $473, the cost per

incremental full remission is $5,909, and the cost per incremental partial remission is $3,377.

V.              Results: Changes Over Time in Episode Expenditure and Price Indexes

                The results of the expert panels' outcome assessments can be combined with changes over time in

the shares of observed treatment modalities (and their costs) to create various expenditure and price indexes. We



                                                                                                                     9
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




now consider a number of such measures.

              In constructing various expenditure and price indexes, we make alternative assumptions concerning

how to treat the approximately 32% of identified episodes of care (3,910 of 12,097) for which the expert panel did

not make an expected remission probability rating. The alternatives we consider are: (i) use only these 8,187

episodes with panel outcome ratings, and exclude the no mental health treatment episodes; (ii) assign a treatment-

specific worst case outcome from the panel’s outcome rating to all observed episodes in any unrated

treatment/patient cells; and (iii) assign the treatment specific median outcome to all observed episodes in any

unrated treatment/patient cell.

              The simplest calculations involve tracking over time the average spending per full or partial

expected remission, given the changing observed prices and quantities of the treatment/patient cells. Results of

such calculations are given in the top panel of Table 2. There it is seen that from 1991 to 1996, the average

spending per expected full remission, and per partial remission, remains unchanged at 100 when only the rated

cases are included. When unrated cases are assigned the worst outcome, the average expenditure indexes fall

from 100 in 1991 to 84 (full remission) and 86 (partial remission) in 1996. One reason underlying this decline in

average spending per remission when unrated cases are assigned a worst case outcome is that the proportion of

cases rated increases from 62% in 1991 to 73% in 1996, and thus the proportion assigned the worst outcome

declines from 38% in 1991 to 27% in 1996. When the unrated cases are assigned a median outcome, the average

expenditure per full expected remission stays unchanged in 1996 from 1991, but for partial remissions it falls from

100 in 1991 to 90 in 1996.

              The expenditure index per incremental expected full or partial remission is both more relevant and

theoretically attractive than average expenditure indexes that fail to distinguish average from incremental

(marginal) treatment outcomes.25     The incremental remission is defined as the difference between the expected

outcome and the outcome that would be expected if the patient received no treatment; incremental measures are

given in the bottom panels of Table 2. Based on only the panel's rated outcome episodes, the spending per

incremental expected full remission falls from 100 in 1991 to 83 in 1996, an average annual growth rate (AAGR)

of about -3.6%. When unrated episodes are added and assigned either the worst or median outcome, by 1996 the

index falls to 78 and to 88, respectively, with AAGRs of -4.8% and -2.5%. For incremental partial remissions, use



                                                                                                                10
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




of rated only, rated plus unrated assigned worst outcome, and rated plus unrated assigned median outcome, yield

1991-96 AAGRs of -2.1%, -4.6% and -2.1%, respectively.

             One interesting feature of these results is that in almost all cases, expenditure indexes per

incremental expected remission fall more rapidly than average expenditure per remission (only in the unrated

assigned median outcome case, with partial remissions, does this not occur, and there the indexes coincide in

1996).

             While these relatively simple expenditure indexes are of interest, they are not quite the same as

conventional price indexes. We have computed a Laspeyres price index with 1991 fixed quantity weights, a

Paasche fixed quantity index with 1996 fixed weights, and a Fisher-Ideal price index (the geometric mean of the

Laspeyres and Paasche).26 As seen in Table 3, without any reference to outcome, the treatment price index falls

from 100 in 1991 to 95.0 (Laspeyres), 99.4 (Paasche), and 97.2 (Fisher-Ideal) in 1996. When the elementary unit

is defined as the price per expected incremental full remission, the Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher-Ideal price

indexes show a small rise to 103.4, 104.0 and 103.7, respectively.

             In 1992 and 1993, the Laspeyres index for incremental full remissions shows a decline in nominal

prices with a rise occurring between 1994-1996. The Paasche index shows price increases in 1993-1995. Table 3

also reveals slightly increasing prices for the expected incremental partial remissions. The Laspeyres index moves

from 100 in 1991 to 103.9, in 1996, while the Paasche moves from 100 to 104.7 and the Fisher-Ideal from 100.0

to 104.3 over the same time period. Hence the trends in price indexes are moderately sensitive to how one treats

expected outcomes.      While outcomes-adjusted price indexes increase slightly in Table 3, the corresponding

average expenditure indexes in Table 2 fall, and even more so when incremental remissions are employed.      Note

that during the 1991-96 time period, increased levels of management have been exercised over the mental health

benefit. One implication of this is that the patient population being treated may have been changing (along with

the mix of treatment bundles), thereby affecting both expected outcome and cost.          These changes are not

incorporated into the fixed weight price indexes in Table 3.

             To account for the effect of changing patient mixes on computed price indexes, we employ hedonic-

like equations. We have specified and estimated a number of such models, based on data from the 8,187 rated

treatment episodes.27      We delineate eight patient categories, depending on whether medical comorbidity is



                                                                                                               11
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




present, whether male, if female whether over age 50, and whether there is comorbid substance abuse. The eight

cases are, respectively (Y for yes, N for no) 1 – NYNY; 2 – NNNY; 3 – YYNN; 4 – YNYN; 5 – YNNN: 6 –

NYNN; 7 – NNYN; and 8 – NNNN. We estimate three alternative hedonic equations for the price per expected

full remission, all of which are reported in Table 4. The specifications differ across the three models. In Equation

(1) of Table 4, the left hand variable is the natural log of spending per episode of treatment. The right hand

variables include the probability of a full remission associated with the patient’s treatment, dummy variables for 7

of 8 patient categories, and year dummies (1991 is excluded). Equation (2) has a left hand variable that measures

the natural log of the price divided by the incremental probability of full remission minus a small constant (0.001,

to ensure feasibility of taking logarithms). The right hand side variables are the same as in Equation (1), only now

the probability of full remission is excluded as a regressor, since incremental remission probability is incorporated

into the dependent variable. Equation (3) is the same as Equation (1) except that the probability of full remission

is replaced by the log odds of the probability of expected full remission. Hence the difference between Equations

(1) and (3) is only the way in which expected outcomes appears as a regressor – linear, or log odds ratio. We

estimate these equations by ordinary least squares; standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust.

              As seen in Table 4, variations in patient categories have significant and substantial effects on

treatment costs, with categories 2 (comorbid substance abuse) and 4 (comorbid medical conditions) being

particularly large and positive. A second important result is that, ceteris paribus, treatments having greater

probability of full remission have higher costs. In Equation (1), the remission probability enters in linear form,

whereas in Equation (3) it is in the form of a log odds ratio; in both cases, the coefficient is positive and highly

significant, with their robust t-statistics being very similar.

              In terms of time effects as captured by yearly dummy variables, the results reported in Table 4

display considerable stability across models, with all three equations having estimated price reductions. The

magnitude of the reductions from 1991 to 1996 ranges from 8.3% (in price per incremental remission) in Equation

2 to 12.8% in price per remission in Equation 1, with AAGRs from –1.66% to –2.13%. The 1991 to 1996

differences are significantly different from zero at the (p<0.05) level for Equation 1 and 3 and at p<0.10 for

Equation 2. For most years, prices are estimated to be lower than in 1991. Yet only in the later years are the

differences from 1991 statistically significant. Moreover, the estimates are not very precise in several cases



                                                                                                                  12
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




(p<0.10). The differences between the hedonic price indexes in Table 4 and the alternative price indexes from

Table 3 appear, therefore, to result from a changing and increasingly complex mix of patients, and changes in

treatment bundles, over the six year period; we discuss this further below.

                 Table 5 presents corresponding hedonic regression results for expected partial remissions. The

specifications mirror those described for Table 4.          Overall, the results are qualitatively quite similar across

specifications. The two equations which estimate the price per expected partial remission arrive at nearly identical

estimates of the 1991-1996 price change, with both models having an estimated significant reduction of 12.2%

over the six years. The price per partial remission in Equation 2 is estimated to have fallen by about 4.8% over the

six years, but this estimate is not statistically significant.

                 It is important to note that the hedonic regressions in Tables 4 and 5 suggest a rather different set of

price movements than the simple price indexes reported in Table 3. The main reason for the difference is that the

variables describing the composition of cases are included in the regressions, but are not properly controlled for in

the traditional price index calculations. For example, the mix of patients has been changing over time. To

illustrate this point, consider depressed patients with medical comorbidities. In 1991, about 13% of episodes

involved comorbid medical diagnoses, but by 1995 nearly 23% of episodes involved such conditions, and in 1996

this share fell to 19%. Comorbidities are known to complicate treatment and make it more costly. Thus, when the

hedonic model controls for the changing patient composition of the treated population, as well as changes in

expected outcomes, the price indexes show declines in the nominal prices of expected full and partial remissions.

                 It is also interesting to note that when price is measured as spending per incremental expected full or

partial remission as in Equation (2) in Tables 4 and 5, a great deal of extra variation is introduced into the data

(recall from Table 1 that some prices per incremental remission approach infinity), the yearly time coefficients are

all less precisely estimated, and the goodness of fit declines dramatically. This is an area that merits further

investigation.

                 Together these results suggest that the price of treating cases of major depression, conditional on

expected outcome, generally fell during the 1991-1996 period. To place these results in context, we make two

sets of observations. First, for thirty years a basic assumption in health care policy has been that the prices of

medical treatments are increasing at rates far in excess of general inflation. Mental health treatments have been



                                                                                                                      13
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




viewed as particularly inflationary (Phelps, 1999). Our results reported here refute that conventional wisdom.

The second observation is that these results differ notably from standard price indexes that focus on discrete

elements of treatment. Table 6 reports on a set of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Indexes

(PPIs) that are related to components of mental health care. In all cases, the PPIs rise, and rise at higher rates than

any of the estimates presented above – be they expenditure indexes, traditional price indexes, or indexes drawn

from the estimated hedonic regressions. Thus, focusing on outcomes of care related to specific episodes of

treatment yields different strikingly different price trends than does price measurement based on components of

care.28

VI.           Discussion

              The findings reported here suggest that the use of expected outcomes data, based on an expert panel

elicitation procedure, is a feasible and reasonable approach to computing price indexes for medical treatments that

take into account variations in expected outcomes, and in patient populations.

              The usefulness and credibility of this procedure, however, hinge in large part on the underlying

reliability of the effectiveness or outcomes measures. One check for face validity involves examining the relative

impacts on remission probabilities of variations in patient comorbidities and demographics generated in this

elicitation process, to make sure they are generally consistent with medical literature and practice. Results from

such a validity check are reassuring. We find, for example, that the mean probability of full remission (across

experts) is lower for patients with a medical comorbidity compared to patients without a comorbidity (0.22 vs.

0.25), and is lower for patients treated in primary care settings compared to those in specialty care (0.22 vs 0.24).

              Since our data involves patients over the 1991-96 time frame, a second validity check is available to

us. Specifically, we track each episode of treatment for 18 months following the 16 week treatment, to assess

whether that patient had a recurrence of diagnosed depression in the form of a new episode. We then perform a

simple logistic regression of the probability of the recurrence of depression, where the panel's mean estimated

probability of full remission from the 16-week treatment modality initially received by that individual is a

regressor. The estimated coefficient on the probability of full remission regressor is negative and significant (p <

0.001), indicating that increasing the probability of an expected full remission is associated with a decreased risk

of having a repeat episode of care. This result is robust to inclusion of patient and treatment characteristic dummy



                                                                                                                    14
EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PRICE INDEXES FOR DEPRESSION TREATMENTS




variables, and provides additional support for the reliability and validity of the outcome probabilities obtained

through the elicitation process.

              The results we have obtained suggest that incorporating off-frontier treatment variations over time

does not materially change findings from previous research on treatment of depression: the cost of treating an

episode of depression has fallen from 1991 to 1996. To see this in a different way, in Figure 1 we plot predicted

treatment spending on the vertical axis, and probability of full remission on the horizontal axis, based on

parameter estimates from Equation (3) in Table 4. We plot predicted spending for 1991, and for 1996, when all

other regressors are evaluated at the overall 1991 through 1996 sample means. As can be seen in Figure 1, while

predicted treatment costs increase at an increasing rate as the expected probability of a full remission rises (a

movement along both curves), there has been a noticeable downward shift in the treatment cost function from

1991 to 1996. An implication is that, since expenditures on depression are thought to be increasing since at least

1991, the source of the spending increases is volume (quantity) increases, and not price increases. An implication

of this is that given a budget for treatment of depression, more could be accomplished, in terms of producing

health, in 1996 than in 1991. While this result is at odds with many long-held notions about mental health care, it

is consistent with the findings of the Surgeon General’s Report on Mental Health. 29 That report noted advances in

both the science and delivery of mental health treatments in the U.S.

              Finally, in this research we have confined our attention to the supply side, where prices are

envisaged as total receipts obtained by providers for treatment episodes (remissions) delivered by them to patients.

Evaluating marginal prices from the point of view of the consumer (patient) is considerably more complicated.

Consumers' marginal copayments for treatments may be affected by nonlinear schedules involving the number of

treatments, and by other forms of risk-sharing.30 Patients' valuations of their time involved in treatment, and the

relative time path of their response to alternative treatments, affect the marginal cost-benefit calculations as

viewed by the patient.31 Also, patients suffering from mental illness may not be able to reveal their preferences

for care according to the tenets of economic theory. The symptomatic benefits of treatment may well also spill

over to ability to function, and to be productive while at work.32      Even more difficult issues emerge when

evaluating the benefits of an entirely new treatment modality via reservation prices, and tracking out the impacts

on future consumption and enjoyment.33

greater severity of illness, and elements of longer term treatment.

   There is a large literature on the cross-sectional variation in medical treatments for other conditions and

   The panel consisted of four psychiatrists, four clinical psychologists, and two general internists. Panelist
averaged 19.9 years in professional practice (range, 11-42). The mean number of depressive patients treated
by panelists in the previous year was 63.7 (range, 4-200). Panel members were David Adler, MD;

   Use of the Tornqvist approximation to the translog price index resulted in rather volatile shares and
quantities. Moreover, with the translog index the use of logarithms and the adding up of shares implies that

the price index per incremental remission is the same as the price per remission. For these reasons, we
employ the Fisher rather than the translog.
