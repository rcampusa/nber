                                               ABSTRACT

I examine the effects of an unearned income transfer on the retirement rates and living arrangements
of a very poor population by studying the effects of pensions on the decisions of black Union Army
veterans. I find that blacks were 2 to 5 times as responsive as whites to income transfers in their retirement
decisions and 6 to 8 times as responsive in their choice of independent living arrangements. I argue
that blacks' greater poverty explains their responsiveness to pensions. My findings have implications
for understanding racial differences in trends in retirement and independent living. I show that the
retirement rates of both blacks and whites rose between 1900 and 1930 but that convergence in black
and white rates and in living arrangements only occurred between 1930 and 1950. I argue that income
effects from the institution of Social Security explain up to half of the convergence in black-white
retirement rates and in living arrangements.

   The first generation of African Americans to reach age 65 in the twentieth century could not

afford to retire. The majority had grown up in slavery and left it with no accumulated wealth. In

the south in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century blacks had only 5.8 cents of wealth

for every dollar of white wealth (Margo 1984). As Gunnar Myrdal (1962: 205) wrote of African

Americans in the 1930s, “Their incomes are not only low but irregular. They thus live from day to

day and have scant security for the future.” One group of African Americans was more fortunate

in their old age – the veterans of the Union Army. These men became eligible for a pension that

was a pure income transfer given regardless of own income, wealth, or labor force participation.

   This paper uses the Union Army pension program to examine the effects of an unearned income

transfer on the retirement rates and living arrangements of a very poor population. Understanding

the effect of income on elderly labor supply and living arrangements is important for policy makers

because Social Security programs have both income and substitution effects. It is also important

for researchers interested in understanding how secular increases in wealth have affected trends

in retirement and independent living. Unfortunately isolating an income effect is hard and in the

search for both exogenous and substantial income transfers researchers have looked at lottery win-

ners (Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote 2001) and recipients of inheritances (Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian,

and Rosen 1993), but the focus of these studies has not been the elderly.

   Studying the Union Army generation can provide insights into how increases in wealth have af-

fected the experiences of later cohorts of African Americans because African Americans remained

poor for a long time. Virtually all of the increase in the black-white earnings ratio occurred in the

1940s and from 1963 to 1975 (Donohue and Heckman 1991). The gap in white-black homeowner-

ship rates fell slightly from 1920 to 1940 but did not fall substantially until the 1960s (Collins and

Margo 2001). Even in the 1990s, white households held five to ten times the net worth of black

households (Smith 1995; Hurst, Luoh, Stafford 1998; Wolff 1998; Davern and Fisher 201), largely




                                                  1
because of differences in black-white earnings (Barsky, Bound, Charles, and Lupton 2002).1

       My findings will have implications for the rise in black retirement rates prior to 1930 and for the

convergence in black and white retirement rates and living arrangements between 1930 and 1950.

As the paper will show, although both black and white retirement rates rose between 1880 and

1930, the black-white retirement gap did not narrow until 1940. The convergence in black-white

retirement rates was accompanied by convergence in living arrangements among the retired. If

independent living is a normal good, then black retirees became much better off between 1930-50.

Could rising wealth explain the rise in black retirement rates prior to 1930? Could rising wealth

and the institution of Social Security in 1935 explain the 1930 and 1950 convergence?

       There have been many studies of the effects of Social Security Old Age and Survivors’ Insur-

ance on retirement rates and elderly living arrangements (e.g. Hurd and Boskin 1984; Hausman

and Wise 1985; Krueger and Pischke 1992; Michael et al. 1980; McGarry and Schoeni 2000;

Costa 1999), but most studies do not estimate wealth effects; studies of living arrangements have

focused on older, non-married women; and, the applicability to the past of estimates based on re-

cent data is questionable. Wealth levels have risen, health has improved, and as retirement rates

have risen, the characteristics of the marginal person in the labor force have changed. Studies of

past populations have examined white Union Army veterans (Costa 1998, 1997, 1995) and may

thus reveal little about the experience of blacks. For example, Friedberg’s (1999) study of the ef-

fects of Social Security Old Age Assistance, a means and wealth tested program, found that blacks

were three times as responsive as whites to benefit increases between 1940 and 1950. Research

on modern families has emphasized that norms of filial responsibility are greater among blacks

than among non-Hispanic whites (e.g. Burr and Mutchler 1999) and scholars have argued that

the importance attached to familial relations has persisted from African history and culture (e.g.
   1
     Although two-thirds of the recent mean difference in wealth between blacks and whites can be explained by differ-
ences in earnings (Barsky, Bound, Charles, and Lupton 2002), blacks’ greater spending on conspicuous consumption
to increase social status may also play a role (Charles, Hurst, and Roussanov 2007).

McDaniel 1990; Morgan et al. 1993). Did blacks have different preferences from whites or were

they simply poorer?



1 Trends

The rise of retirement began before the institution of Social Security (see Figure 1). The retirement

rates of all non-institutionalized men older than 64 rose from slightly more than 20 percent in 1880

to 40 percent in 1930, doubling in the fifty years prior to the institution of Social Security in 1935.

Between 1940 and 1980 retirement rates rose from 55 to 80 percent, remaining roughly at that

level to the present day.2 Black men also experienced increases in retirement rates, but began at

much lower levels. Their retirement rates rates rose from somewhat more than 10 percent in 1880

to 25 percent in 1930 and then to over 80 percent in 1980.3

       Figure 1 provides suggestive support for the role of Social Security in explaining black-white

convergence in retirement rates. In 1930 there was a 16 percentage point difference in retirement

rates between black and white men older than 64, a larger gap than in 1880. By 1940 the gap had

narrowed to 7 percentage points and by 1950 to 2 percentage points. After 1950 black men older

than 64 were slightly more likely to be retired than whites. Convergence patterns were roughly

similar in both the North and South (see Figure 2). However, while in the North convergence had

occurred by 1940, in the South convergence had to wait until 1950. The retirement rates of men

age 55 to 64 converged between 1940 and 1950 and the retirement rates of blacks exceeded those
   2
      Retirement rates pre- and post-Social Security are not strictly comparable. In 1940 the definition of the labor force
changed in 1940 from one of gainful employment to the current definition. See Moen (1987) for a consistent labor
force participation series using the gainful definition of employment. Moen (1987) estimates only a 1.7 percentage
point difference in retirement rates calculated using the gainful definition compared to the current definition in 1940
and a 5.6 percentage point difference in retirement rates in 1950, with slightly lower retirement rates using the gainful
definition of employment. When I calculated retirement rates in 1940 and 1950 using Moen’s gainful definition of
employment for 1940 and 1950, I found a 7 percentage point difference in black-white retirement rates in 1940 and a 3
percentage point difference in black-white retirement rates in 1950. These differences were similar to those calculated
under the current definition of employment.
    3
      Differential institutionalization rates cannot explain these patterns. Between 1870 and 2000 the institionalization
rate of men older than 64 never reached 4 percent among whites and never reached 5 percent among blacks.

of whites by 1950 (see Figure 3).

       Figure 4 shows that black retirees’ adoption of independent living co-incided with the institu-

tion of Social Security whereas this change predated the institution of Social Security for white

retirees. Among black retirees age 64 and older headship rates fluctuated between 47 and 56 per-

cent between 1870 and 1930. Headship rates rose from 50 percent in 1930 to 66 percent in 1940

and reached a peak of 84 percent in 1970 before declining to 80 percent in 2000. In contrast,

among white retirees headship rates rose steadily from 41 percent in 1870 to 64 percent in 1930

and continued rising steadily thereafter. Headship rates of black men still in the labor force never

fell below 81 percent between 1870 and 2000, averaging around 87 percent. Those of white non-

retirees never fell below 84 percent in this period and averaged around 89 percent. Examining

the fraction of elderly men living with at least one of their own children shows that among both

black and white men still in the labor force the fraction living with one of their children has been

declining since 1870. The pattern for retirees resembles that observed when examining headship

rates.

       Blacks’ retirement rates may have converged to those of whites not because of the institution of

Social Security but because in the 1930s they were more adversely affected by the Great Depres-

sion, by New Deal acreage restrictions that encouraged capital intensive farming methods, and by

the mechanization of cotton picking in the 1940s (Donohue and Heckman 1991). Migration from

the farm may have forced the elderly to live on their own. The convergence of retirement rates

even among men age 55 to 64, a group ineligible for Social Security, suggests that labor demand

drove the change in black retirement rates. However, between 1940 and 1950, when black retire-

ment rates surpassed those of whites, unemployment rates in this age group fell for both whites

and blacks.4 Because few black births would have been registered, men in this age group might

have been collecting Social Security benefits. A comparison of ages at death on death certificates

2 Retirement and Living Arrangement Decisions

Union Army pensions represent a pure income effect on labor supply and therefore should have

induced more men to retire at any given age. The question I pose is by how much Union Army

pensions reduced labor supply for veterans in their later years. Pensions might have two different

effects on the retirement decision. They will directly affect income flows and the receipt of pen-

sions in the past will increase current assets, allowing veterans to retire earlier. I estimate only

the direct effect of pensions. The estimated effect of pensions will therefore be a lower bound

estimate.6

       The effect of an income transfer will depend on the size of the pension relative to income.

Low earners should be more responsive to pension income than high earners, that is black veterans

should be more responsive to pension income than white veterans. However, those without any

wealth, as was true for most black veterans, may not find a pension enough to retire on, particularly

if they subsidize needy friends and relatives (see Case and Deaton 1998 and Ardington, Case, and

Hosegood 2007 for evidence on income pooling among South Africans receiving pensions). A

Civil War widow (and pension recipient) interviewed in the 1930s reported that “the negroes of

East Austin consider her a sort of bank. Whenever any one needs a dime or a quarter, he or she

thinks, ‘Nancy has the money”’ (Works Progress Administration 2000). Ninety-four percent of

black men employed as domestic servants in Philadelphia at the end of the nineteenth century had

parents or others dependent on them (Du Bois 1899: 461).
   5
     Linking individuals to previous censuses shows that age in the census tends to be overstated beginning as early as
age 50 (Elo and Preston 1994), but does not preclude that men listed as age 55-64 in the 1940 census were collecting
Social Security benefits.
   6
     Given the poverty of African-Americans, it is unlikely that pension income contributed much to asset holdings.



                                                          5
      If independent living is a normal good then examining the living arrangements of retirees pro-

vides some clues about their financial wherewithall. I therefore examine the effect of Union Army

pensions on living arrangements. The impact of pensions on living arrangements is theoretically

ambiguous. The decision of older men and their kin to share living quarters is a function of income,

including pension income, and prices, including shadow prices, faced both by the older men and

their relatives. Such demographic variables as kin availability and such institutional variables as

the rules of the Union Army program can be thought of as affecting the shadow price. The impact

of these income and price variables on living arrangements will depend on the underlying model

of living arrangements, the preferences of individuals, and household decisions made throughout

the life cycle. For example, under a bargaining model if a man preferred to live on his own then

a sizable government transfer would enable him to do so whereas if he preferred to live with rel-

atives then it would enable him to bribe them. Under an altruism model a government transfer

might either wholly or partially displace children’s transfers and therefore have either no or very

little impact on the living arrangements of older men.



3 Union Army Pensions

Both black and white veterans were eligible for a pension. Congress established the basic system

of pension laws, known as the General Law pension system, in 1862 to provide pensions to both

regular recruits and volunteers who were disabled as a direct result of military service. The dollar

amount depended on the degree of disability, regardless of the veteran’s employment status, his

job if employed, or his wealth. Application was through a pension attorney, and the degree of

disability was determined by a board of three local doctors employed by the Pension Bureau and

following guidelines established by the bureau.7

      The act of 27 June 1890 instituted a univeral disability and old-age pension program for Union
  7
      Black attorneys were active in processing claims (Brimmer 2006).

Army veterans. According to the veterans’ lobby, the new law would “place upon the rolls all

survivors of the war whose conditions of health are not practically perfect” (quoted in Glasson

1918: 223). Within a year of the act’s passage, the number of pensioners on the rolls more than

doubled. Any disability now entitled a veteran to a pension and a veteran who could not claim

a service related disability received from $6.00 to $12.00 per month or from 19 to 38 percent of

the monthly income of a laborer. However, an applicant who could trace his disability to the war

(often because of the incorrect medical theories of the time such as marching in the damp causing

rheumatism) received substantially more for the same disability than his counterpart who could

not.

   In 1890 the Pension Bureau instructed the examining surgeons to grant a minimum pension

to all men at least 65 years of age, unless they were unusually vigorous. At age 75 men became

eligible for an even larger pension. In 1904, Executive Order 78 officially authorized the Pension

Bureau to grant pensions on the basis of age. Under the Service and Age Pension Act of 6 February

1907 pensions were $12.00 per month for veterans age 62 to 69, $15.00 per month for those age

70 to 74, $20.00 per month for those older than 74. This act did not increase the total number of

pensioners on the rolls; it mainly induced pensioners to switch from the 1890 law to the 1907 law.

   When the pension system was first created blacks had close to the same approval rate as whites

(roughly 85 percent for blacks and 89 percent for whites). However, by 1890, 81 percent of whites

who had applied for pension support had been approved, compared to only 44 percent of black

applicants. In the years prior to the 1890 liberalization, the pension board approved more and

more pensions, even though the conditions being pensioned often had a tenuous link to service in

the war. But black veterans apparently were not granted the same leniency.

   The 1890 Law increased black participation in the pension system. By 1900 91 percent of

black applicants had applied under the 1890 Law whereas only slightly more than half of all white

applicants had done so. Because pension amounts were lower under the 1890 Law than under the


                                                7
General Law, the average black pension in 1900 was $7.59 per month compared to $12.94 per

month for whites. Nonetheless blacks and whites received roughly equal treatment under the 1890

Law. Between 1890 and 1899, 74 percent of black applications under the 1890 Law were approved

by the end of the period, compared to 81 percent of white applications under the 1890 Law. The

mean pension awarded to whites during this period was only 80 cents higher per month than the

mean pension awarded to blacks.8 In 1900 median pensions awarded to blacks were the same in

both the north and the south, suggesting that system was a federal one and did not depend on region

of residence.

       By 1910, when by law men could receive a pension purely on the basis of age, 83 percent

of black applicants had applied under the aged-based 1907 Law, 16 percent under the 1890 Law,

and only 1 percent under the General Law. Among whites the respective figures were 64 percent

applying the 1907 Law, 14 percent under the 1890 Law, and 22 percent under the General Law.

Blacks were less likely to suffer from war wounds but had greater rates of arteriosclerosis and

congestive heart failure than whites (Costa, Helmchen, and Wilson 2007). Pension recipiency

among blacks in 1910 was probably slightly lower than among whites. I was able to find in the

pension records 86 percent of a sample of whites who identified themselves as Union veterans in

the 1910 census and 79 percent of blacks who reported themselves to be veterans.9

       Although mean pensions were lower for blacks than for whites, pensions replaced a higher

fraction of blacks’ wage income. In 1900 the mean pension of $12.94 per month given to whites

replaced 36 percent of the earnings of a manufacturing worker. In contrast, the mean pension of
   8
      The boards of physicians who examined pension applicants seem to have had a systematic upward bias in desig-
nating white veterans as disabled relative to blacks. For example, by 1900, 4.5 percent of black examinees were blind
in at least one eye, compared to 4.0 percent of whites. However, of those who were blind in at least one eye, only 44
percent of blacks had been rated as disabled, compared to 88 percent of whites.
    9
      Because many African Americans changed their names after the war, it may be harder to find black veterans than
white veterans. Interviews with former slaves in the 1930s discuss both military service (either own, a father’s, or a
husband’s) and pension recipiency. Only one interview revealed lack of knowledge of pensions: “After I went blind I
had hard times. Folks, white folks and all, brought me food. But that wasn’t any good way to get along. Sometimes I
ate, sometimes I didn’t. So some of my white, friends dug up my record with the Yankees and got me a pension. How
I’m setting pretty for de rest of my life” (Works Progress Administration 2000, interview of Uncle William Baltimore).

$7.59 per month given to blacks replaced 47 percent of their earnings.10



4 Data

Two datasets are used in the analyses. The first dataset is based on the military service and pension

records of 5,673 black Union Army soldiers in 51 infantry companies.11 This sample is represen-

tative of the US Colored Troops in terms of geography and slave status. Twenty-nine percent of

the men in the sample were free; 28 percent of them were from the free states and the remaining

72 percent were from the border and southern states. Twenty-two percent of these men died while

in the service, a higher service mortality rate than that of 14 percent for white soldiers, mainly

because sanitary conditions for black troops were so poor. Over 90 percent of black service deaths

were from disease.

       The military service records provide information on state of birth, age and occupation at en-

listment, year and place of enlistment, and on all military service events such as death, injury,

and illness. The pension records provide information on pension recipiency and dollar amount re-

ceived, date of death (if on the pension rolls), post-bellum residence, and occupation.12 The records

of the examining surgeons provide information on height, weight, and various chronic conditions.

       Veterans are linked to the 1870, 1880, 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930 censuses which provide

information on occupation (and therefore labor force participation), head of household status,

whether any own children were present in the household, and characteristics such as literacy. Past
  10
      Average annual earnings for a manufacturing worker in 1900 were $432 per year (see Table Ba4298-4313, p2̇-268
of Historical Statistics of the United States: Earliest Times to the Present, Millenial Edition). Smith (1984) estimates
that in 1900 the black-white wage ratio was 0.449.
   11
      The original sample of 52 companies contained one company of old men. The sample represents roughly 2.7
percent of all blacks serving. The data are available from the Center for Population Economics at the University of
Chicago, http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.
   12
      Soldiers who survived the war were less likely to have a pension record if they had ever deserted (deserters who
never returned to fight were ineligible), if they had never been injured in the war, if they were not from a fighting
regiment, if they had never been promoted, if they were born in the Confederacy, if they were freemen, and if they
were light-skinned.



                                                           9
censuses and the pension records provide information on last occupation, a measure of opportu-

nity cost. Only men linked to the 1900 and 1910 censuses are used in the analysis. Because black

mortality rates were relatively high, only 1,060 black veterans survived to 1900 and 744 survived

to 1910. Of these, 76 percent are linked to the 1900 census and 83 percent are linked to the 1910

census.13 I restricted the sample to the non-institutionalized. When using health information in the

analyses, I also limited the sample to men for whom this information is available. Total sample

sizes are 885 in 1900 and 548 in 1910. When I restrict the samples to men with information on

pension amount, the sample sizes become 877 and 542, respectively.

       The second dataset is drawn from the 1.4 percent 1910 Integrated Public Use Micro Sample

(IPUMS), which identified veteran status. This census identifies 204 black non-institutionalized

Union Army veterans age 60-85. Veterans were undernumerated: only 45 percent of black men

in the Union Army sample are listed as veterans in the census.14 I therefore add veterans from

the Union Army sample to create an “expanded IPUMS” sample, giving me 729 black Union

Army veterans 729 men age 60-85. When I restrict to states in which I have both veterans and

non-veterans, the sample size falls to 678 men.

       Veterans in the Union Army sample were similar to the self-identified veterans in IPUMS in

most characteristics, but they were more likely to be household heads, less likely to be home

owners, and were more likely to live in a smaller town (see Table 1). Using age as reported in

the military service and pension records, veterans in the Union Army sample were on average one

year younger than IPUMS veterans. But in the census Union Army veterans reported themselves

one year older on average than their ages in their military service and pension records.

       Table 1 also reveals that compared to non-veterans all black veterans were more likely to be

literate, less likely to live on a farm and more likely to live in a larger town, and were about one
  13
      Men were less likely to be found in the 1900 and 1910 censuses if they were living in one of the largest 100 cities
circa and if they were from a free state.
   14
      Men were more likely to state that they were veterans if they were out of the labor force, were receiving a higher
pension, and were household heads.

year older. In contrast, white Union Army veterans were more likely to be in a smaller town than

white non-veterans who had been born in a northern state or who had immigrated prior to 1865.

Similarly, white Confederate veterans were more likely to be in a small town than white southern-

born non-veterans. White Union Army veterans were more likely to be retired than non-veterans,

but the difference in retirement rates was not as large as the difference between the retirement rates

of black veterans and non-veterans.



5 Empirical Framework

5.1 Retirement

I use four different empirical strategies to estimate the effect of pensions on the retirement rates

of black Union Army veterans. The first two strategies compare pension recipients and non-

recipients. The last two strategies examine recipients using variation in pension amount between

recipients. The four strategies identify different pension effects when response to pension amount

depends on the size of the transfer. Consider a simple case in which non-recipients have a pension

of zero and do not retire; some recipients have a small pension of p1 and do not retire because

the pension is not enough for subsistence; and other recipients have a large pension of p2 and

retire. When I look at the sample of recipients, the average treatment effect on the treated is

(1 − 0)/(p2 − p1 ). When I look at the sample of recipients and non-recipients, the average treat-

ment effect on the treated is (r̄ − 0)/(p̄ − 0) where r̄ is the mean retirement rate and p̄ is mean

pension amount among recipients. Because (1 − 0)/(p2 − p1 ) > (r̄ − 0)/(p̄ − 0), estimates of the

average treatment effect from the sample of recipients will be greater than estimates comparing the

sample of recipients and non-recipients.15 Both estimates will over-estimate the effect of giving
  15
     If the fraction of men receiving pensions of p1 is n1 and the fraction of men receiving pensions of p2 is n2 then
r̄ = n2 and p̄ = n1 p1 + n2 p2 . r̄/p̄ can be written as 1/( nn12 p1 + p2 ) and the denominator of this term is greater than
p2 − p1 .

men a small pension (which is 0) and under-estimate the effect of going from no pension to a large

pension.

   The first strategy uses propensity score matching to compare black Union Army veterans with

non-veterans, using both the IPUMS sample and the expanded IPUMS sample. In comparing

veterans and non-veterans, I cannot control for poor health arising from wartime service, but, by

comparing retirement rates between Confederate veterans and southern-born non-veterans, I can

use a differences in differences strategy to account for war-time health shocks. Because Confeder-

ate veterans were ineligible for a Federal pension (and served longer and in worse health conditions

than Union Army soldiers), any differences in retirement rates between Confederate veterans and

southern-born non-veterans must be due to their worse health. I can examine whether black sol-

diers were more or less responsive to pensions than white soldiers by comparing the retirement

rates of white Union Army veterans with those of white non-veterans who were either northern-

born or who had immigrated to the United States prior to 1865. I first derive propensity scores

from a probit regression of veteran status on age; the log of population in the town of residence;

dummies for literacy, marital status, whether the man was residing on a farm, whether the man

owned property (known only for household heads), whether the man was the head of the house-

hold, and whether any own children were living with the man; and state fixed effects. (Because

some of these variables may be determined by pension amount, I also run regressions using only

age and region of residence fixed effects.) The propensity scores were then used in nearest neigh-

bor matching with a caliper of 0.1 and with no replacement. A disadvantage of this approach is

that if black veterans have a higher probability of being in worse health relative to whites, I will

overestimate pension effects.

   The second strategy also compares pension recipients with non-recipients but uses the Union

Army sample and compares retirement rates in 1900 of veterans who were not on the rolls be-

cause their pension application had been rejected with veterans who were on the rolls. There were


                                                12
143 rejectees in 1900 and 745 pensioners. (In 1910 there were only 9 rejectees.) Again, com-

parisons are done using propensity score matching. The propensity scores were derived from a

probit regression of veteran status on age; the logarithm of town population; dummies for liter-

acy, marital status, whether the man was residing on a farm, whether the man was the head of the

household, whether the man owned property, and whether any own child was in the household;

area of residence (either a state or a region) fixed effects; dummies for last occupation; Body Mass

Index (BMI=weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and BMI squared; and four

dummies indicating whether the veteran had difficulty walking or bending and whether he was

paralyzed or blind. The propensity scores were then used in nearest neighbor matching with a

caliper of 0.1 and no replacement. An advantage of this approach is that I can explicitly control

for functional limitations such as difficulty in walking.

   The third strategy examines discontinuities in retirement rates at age 70 in 1910 when pension

rates rose from $12 to $15 per month. I present suggestive evidence from a regression disconti-

nuity design and more definitive results from a propensity matching score estimator. My estimate

compares veterans age 65 to 69 with those age 70 to 74 and controls for age effects by double

differencing using non-veterans.

   The fourth strategy uses instrumental variable estimation in the Union Army sample in both

1900 and 1910. The Pension Bureau was not supposed to take labor force participation into account

in awarding pensions, but the examining surgeons may have considered labor force status in rating

disabilities. If being out of the labor force was a sign of disability, there will be a spurious positive

relationship between pensions and retirement. If being out of the labor force indicated laziness

and therefore unworthiness, this will lead to a spurious negative relationship between pensions and

retirement. Alternatively, those in the labor force may have been better able to obtain pensions

and to obtain bigger pensions because they could pay the attorney fees or because they were better

connected. This will produce a spurious negative relationship between pensions and retirement.


                                                   13
   The instrumental variable used is a dummy equal to one if the veteran’s last application (or last

successful application if he was on the pension rolls) prior to 1900 was under the General Law. Men

who successfully applied under the General Law received a larger pension for the same disability

than 1890 Law applicants. Because men’s ability to trace their disability to the war depended on

the incorrect medical theories of the time, the law itself should not affect their decision to retire.

Control variables in the instrumental variables regression include age; two dummies indicating

occupation (artisan, professional, or proprietor and laborer, with farmer as the omitted category); a

dummy equal to one if the veteran was married; BMI and BMI squared; four dummies indicating

whether the veteran had difficulty walking or bending and whether he was paralyzed or blind;

dummies indicating literacy, property ownership, whether the veteran had been wounded in the

war, whether the veteran was free at the time of enlistment, whether the veteran lived on a farm,

and whether there were any own children in the household; the logarithm of town population; and

area of residence fixed effects (equal to either a state or a region).



5.2 Living Arrangements

I examine the effect of pensions on elderly living arrangements in 1910. I compare living arrange-

ments between black Union Army veterans and non-veterans, white Union Army veterans and

northern non-veterans, and white Confederate veterans and southern non-veterans. I look at both

retirees and non-retirees to understand differences in their living standards. Because the the Union

Army sample contains too few retirees, I use only the expanded IPUMS sample. The two measures

of living arrangements that I use are whether the man was the household head and whether the man

was living with any of his own children. The samples are restricted to non-institutionalized men

age 60-85. I obtained matches by deriving propensity scores from a probit regression of veteran

status on age; the logarithm of population in the area of residence; dummies for literacy, marital

status, whether the man was residing on a farm, and whether the man owned property; and, state


                                                   14
fixed effects.



6 Results: Retirement

6.1 Recipients and Non-Recipients

Table 2 shows that in a matched sample the difference in retirement rates between black Union

Army veterans and non-veterans ranges from 6.2 to 7.5 percentage points. (When I match only

on age and region of residence fixed effects, the difference in retirement rates ranges from 5.4

(σ̂ =3.7) to 6.9 (σ̂ =1.9) percentage points.) In contrast, there was no difference in retirement

rates between white Confederate veterans and non-veterans. Had all black non-veterans received a

pension comparable to the Union Army pension, their retirement rates would have been either 15.2

or 16.5 percent, implying that pension income explains roughly 61 (=6.2/10.1) to 75 (=7.5/12.1)

percent of the difference in retirement rates between black veterans and non-veterans in the IPUMS

sample.16

       White veterans were less responsive to pension income than black veterans. The difference

in retirement rates between white Union Army veterans and non-veterans who were either born

in a northern state or who had immigrated prior to 1865 was 3.9 percentage points. Assuming

that all black veterans were receiving the average pension of $13.50 in 1910 (as estimated from the

Union Army sample), the average treatment effect on the treated ranges from 0.5 (=6.2/13.5) to 0.6

(=7.5/13.5). Assuming that all white Union Army veterans were receiving the average pension of

$16.90 (as estimated from the Union Army sample), the average treatment effect on the treated is

0.2 (=3.9/16.9). When I use the matched samples to run probit regressions in which the dependent
  16
     I found no evidence that the wives of black Union Army veterans in the expanded IPUMS sample were less
likely to work than the wives of black non-veterans. In the unmatched sample 34.3 percent of the wives of veterans
were working compared to 43.3 percent of the wives of non-veterans. However, in the matched sample labor force
participation rates of non-veteran wives fell to 36.8 percent, a statistically insignificant difference of 2.4 (σ̂ =3.2)
percentage points.

variable is retirement status and the independent variables are veteran status and the variables used

in the matching regression the resulting derivatives calculated at the mean are 0.071 (σ̂ =0.018),

-0.022 (σ̂ =0.068), and 0.049 (σ̂ =0.013) for black Union Army veterans, white Confederate

veterans, and white Union Army veterans, respectively. Double-differencing with the coefficient

for Confederate veterans, the implied average treatment effects on the treated are 0.7 for black

Union Army veterans and 0.4 for white Union Army veterans.

   Table 3 shows the characteristics of men in the Union Army sample in 1900 and in 1910 and

compares the characteristics of rejects in 1900 with those of pensioners. Rejectees had lower

retirement rates than pensioners but they also lived in smaller towns, were less likely to have been

free at enlistment, and were in better health. Compared to rejectees, pensioners were more likely

to have difficulty walking and bending and were more likely to be paralyzed and blind.

   The difference between the retirement rates of rejects and pensioners was 8.8 percentage points.

When rejects and pensioners were matched using only variables available in the census, the differ-

ence rises to 9.9. However when additional controls from the pension records are added (including

the health controls), the difference becomes 7.8 percentage points (see Table 4). Because in the

matched sample of pensioners the monthly pension amount was $8.60, the average treatment ef-

fect on the treated is 0.9 (σ̂ =0.3), greater than the average treatment effect obtained using the

IPUMS samples. This estimate implies that had all non-veterans received a pension in 1910, their

retirement rates would have risen to 21.5, a slightly higher retirement rate than that of veterans.



6.2 Using the Age Discontinuity

The 1907 Law, under which 83 percent of black veterans had applied by 1910, introduced dis-

continuities in pension amount at ages 70 and 75. Figure 5 shows that monthly pension amount

jumps by an estimated $2.52 (σ̂ =0.73) at age 70, slightly less than the expected $3.00. At age

75, monthly pension amount jumps by an estimated $1.53 (σ̂ =2.30), much less than the expected


                                                 16
$5.00, and a statistically insignificant jump. Sample size at older ages is too small to obtain mean-

ingful estimates.

       Examining the discontinuity at age 70 in the extended IPUMS sample (see Figure 6) provides

suggestive evidence of a substantial jump in retirement probabilities at that age. Age in the census

is mis-stated by, on average, one year. The only statistically significant predictor of the difference

between age as given in the pension records and age as given in the census was literacy and the

regression explained hardly any of the variation. Because I cannot adjust age, I therefore use

age as given in the census for everyone. When I do so, I find a negligible jump in retirement

probabilities at age 70 (0.042, σ̂ =0.047), but a qualitatively large though statistically insignificant

jump in retirement probabilities at age 71 (0.071, σ̂ =0.060). In contrast, for black non-veterans

the estimated jump in retirement probabilities at age 70 is 0.015 (σ̂ =0.022) and the estimated jump

in retirement probabilities at age 71 is -0.003 (σ̂ =0.028). Because the average pension difference

was $2.50, the implied average treatment effect on the treated ranges from 1.08 (=(4.2-1.5)/2.5,

estimated at age 70 using a double difference with non-veterans) to 2.8 (=7.1/2.5, calculated using

only the estimated jump for veterans at age 71).

       Table 5 provides further evidence of a jump in retirement rates at age 70. Comparing the

retirement rates of black Union Army veterans in the expanded IPUMS sample at ages 70 to 74 and

65 to 69 yields a difference of 13.7 percentage points when men are matched on basic demographic

and geographic characteristics.17 The same matching with black non-veterans yields a difference

of 5.7 percentage points. Assuming that the difference in pension amount between the two age

groups of veterans was $2.50, the average treatment effect on the treated becomes 3.2 (=(13.7-

5.7)/2.5). Assuming that the difference in pension amount was $3, the average treatment effect on

the treated becomes 2.7.
  17
     When I examined Union Army veterans only and included health as a control for the matches, the difference in
retirement rates was 12.1 (σ̂ =4.5).




                                                       17
6.3 IV Estimates

Men who could trace their disability to wartime service (those receiving money under the General

Law) obtained a larger pension than those could not do so. In 1900 the difference in pension

amount in a matched sample between those who applied under the General Law and those who

applied under the 1890 Law was $3.30. The difference in retirement rates was 5.4 percentage

points, implying an average treatment effect on the treated of 1.6 (=5.4/3.3, σ̂ =2.62). When I

restrict the sample to non-rejectees I find that the difference in pension amount was $3.00 and the

difference in retirement rates was 10.3 percentage points, implying an average treatment effect on

the treated of 3.5 (=10.3/3.0, σ̂ =2.75).

   Table 6 shows the determinants of monthly pension income in 1900 and in 1910. Veterans

who applied under the General Law in 1900, who were older, who were paralyzed, who were

blind, who had been wounded in the war, who were home owners, and who were from larger

towns received larger pensions. In 1910 the literate received smaller pensions, controlling for all

other factors. Because the program was largely age-based in 1910, age was a stronger predictor

of pension amount in 1910 than in 1900 and ill health was a stronger predictor of pension amount

in 1900 than in 1910. More of the variation in pension amount is explained in 1910 than in 1900,

largely because the program was age-based in 1910. Observables explain less of the variation in

pension income for blacks than for whites and applying under the General Law was not as strong

a predictor of pension income for blacks as it was for whites. In contrast to the results for blacks,

home ownership was not a statistically significant predictor of pension amount for whites (see

Costa 1995 for the results for whites).

   Using an ordinary probit model yields a small but statistically significant effect of monthly

pension amount on retirement rates of 0.005 in 1900 and the statistically insignificant and small

effect of monthly pension on retirement rates of 0.006 in 1910 (see Table 7). When the sample

is restricted to men less than 74 years of age, the coefficient on pension amount remains 0.005


                                                 18
(σ̂ =0.001) in 1900 and has the statistically significant but still small value of 0.007 (σ̂ =0.004)

in 1910. There is some suggestive evidence that men who were not home owners in 1910 were

more responsive to pension income. Although the interaction of home ownership with pension

income was not statistically significant (nor jointly statistically significant), the estimated effect of

pensions on retirement rates for non-home owners was 0.012 (σ̂ =0.006).

       The instrumental variable estimates of the effect of pension income on retirement are much

larger in both 1900 and in 1910. In 1900 the instrumental variables estimate implies that a dollar

increase in pension income increases retirement rates by 2.4 percentage points and that in 1910

such an increase leads to a rise in retirement rates of 3.8 percentage points.18 The implied income
                                                           7.6                               13.5
elasticities of retirement at the means are 1.8 (= 0.024[ 0.102 ]) in 1900 and 2.5 (= 0.038[ 0.206 ]) in

1910, much larger than the elasticities for white Union Army veterans of 0.7 in 1900 and 0.5 in

1910 obtained by Costa (1998: 47).19

       The results in Table 7 suggest that blacks faced greater hurdles than whites in obtaining pen-

sions. In contrast to the results for blacks, results for whites showed no increase in the size of

the pension coefficient when I instrumented and no evidence of pension endogeneity (Costa 1995).

Given that home ownership predicted pension income, it is possible that those with higher incomes

and therefore those in the labor force were better able to obtain bigger pensions.

       Table 8, which shows predicted values for the instrumental variables regression at different

pension amounts, suggests that blacks were more responsive to increases in pension income once

they had a basic pension amount. In 1900 the local average treatment effect of going from a pension

of $6 per month to one of $8 per month was 2.4 but that as pension amount increased, the local

average treatment effect rose. As pension amount fell to 0 (for rejectees, for pensioners pension
  18
      When I restrict to men who are matched on all observed characteristics in 1900, including health, and run the same
IV regression on the resulting sample of 125 men, I obtain a derivative of 0.041 (σ̂=0.018), statistically significant at
the 5 percent level.
   19
      The elasticities are calculated as β[ xy ] where β is the coefficient on pension amount, x is mean pension amount,
and y is the mean retirement rate.




                                                          19
amount cannot be less than $6 per month), the local average treatment effect fell to 1.2. Thus even

when pensions replaced roughly the same fraction of income as for whites (37 percent), blacks

were still more responsive to pension income. (Although replacement income may have been the

same, wealth levels would have been lower among blacks.) In 1910 the local average treatment

effect of going from a pension of $12 per month to one of $15 per month was 4.2 and again the

local treatment effect became even greater at larger pension amounts.

   Using predicted retirement rates in 1910 to simulate the effect of giving all black non-veterans

in the 1910 IPUMS a pension equal to $13.50 per month (the average amount received by Union

Army veterans) more than explains the difference in retirement rates between veterans and non-

veterans. Predicted retirement rates for veterans in 1910 not receiving a pension are less than 1

percent. The predicted retirement rate if all veterans had been receiving a monthly pension of

$13.50 is 21.6 percent. The implied average treatment effect is 1.6. If all black non-veterans had

been given a pension of $13.50 their retirement rates would have risen to 30.6 percent, more than

those of veterans.

   If pensions improved health outcomes and therefore enabled men to stay in the labor force

longer I might underestimate the effect of pensions on retirement rates. Using the General Law

as an instrumental variable I am able to determine if men with larger pensions in 1900 were less

likely to have died by 1910 controlling for socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, and

region of residence. I find that pension amount in 1900 raised the probability of dying by 1910 by

a small but statistically insignificant amount (the derivative on monthly pension amount was 0.024

(σ̂ =0.024) controlling for health in 1900 and 0.029 (σ̂ =0.021) not controlling for health).



6.4 Reconciling the Estimates

Table 9 summarizes the various estimates of the treatment effect of Union Army pensions for black

and white veterans. In 1900 the estimates range from 0.9 to 2.4 and in 1910 they range from 0.7


                                                20
to 3.8. Why is there such a large range in estimates? The estimates were obtained using different

methodologies, samples, and sources of identification. The lowest estimates in both 1900 and 1910

were obtained by comparing pension recipients with non-recipients and the highest estimates used

variation induced by pension rules within the sample of recipients. Table 8 showed that as pension

amount rose, then controlling for all other factors, the treatment effect of Union Army pensions

rose. These results suggest that the effect of a minimum pension transfer on retirement rates might

be relatively small because the minimum pension amount by itself was not enough to retire on,

However the effects of going from a small pension to a larger pension were quite substantial.

   The upper bound income effects that I calculated are greater than most estimates of the effects

of Social Security or asset income on retirement obtained from more recent populations, whether

in the U.S. (e.g. Krueger and Pischke 1992; Hausman and Wise 1985; Hurd and Boskin 1984;

Bound 1989) or in developing countries (e.g. Carvalho 2008; Ranchhod 2006; Pérez-Estrada

2008). Friedberg’s (1999) study of the effect of OAA benefits on retirement in 1940 and 1950

imply elasticities of 0.4 for whites and 1.2 for blacks. Her elasticity estimates for both whites

and blacks are smaller than my results for U.S. veterans, perhaps because she was examining a

means and wealth tested program. Like my results, hers suggest that blacks were more responsive

to income transfers than whites. And, as Table 8 showed, they were more responsive than whites

even at lower replacement rates. But even in the US in 1940 and 1950 and in recent developing

country populations, retirement rates were higher than those of African Americans in 1910.



7 Results: Living Arrangements

Pension income enabled black veterans not just to retire but also to maintain a household inde-

pendent of their children. Table 10 shows that while black veterans were 6.9 percentage points

more likely to be household heads than black non-veterans, most of the increase in headship comes



                                                21
among the retired. Headship rates among retired black veterans were 19.9 percentage points greater

than among non-veterans.20 Although retired white Confederate veterans were also more likely to

be household heads than non-veterans, the difference in headship rates was small: only 3.8 percent-

age points. The double-difference estimate implies a difference of 16.1 percentage points between

retired black veterans and non-veterans. In contrast, the double-difference estimate for retired

white Union Army veterans implies a difference of 3.1 percentage points.

       Table 11 shows that while the percentage of men living with at least one of their children was

lower among black veterans than non-veterans by 6.5 percentage points, the difference was greater

among the retired. Among the retired, black veterans were 13.5 percentage points less likely to be

living with a child than non-veterans. Retired white Confederate veterans were less likely to live

with their children than southern-born non-veterans by only 1.2 percentage points. The implied

double difference estimate is -12.3. In contrast, for retired white Union Army veterans the implied

double-difference estimate is only -2.1.

       Both Tables 10 and 11 show that blacks’ living arrangements, regardless of retirement status,

were much more responsive to pension income than those of whites, but that responsiveness to

pension income was particularly large among the retired. Using the double-difference estimate for

the retired and the average pension in the Union Army sample for the retired ($15.30 for blacks

and $18.90 for whites), the average treatment effect on the treated for black headship rates was 1.1

whereas for white headship rates it was only 0.2. The average treatment effect on the treated for

rates of coresidence with children among the retired was -0.8 for blacks and -0.1 for whites.
  20
   The Union Army sample is too small to examine retirees. In the sample as a whole, the derivative on pension
amount in an instrumented probit where headship is the dependent variable is 0.015 (σ̂ =0.012).

8 Implications for Rising Retirement Rates and Black-White

        Convergence

Rising incomes could account for all of the increase in black retirement rates between 1900 and

1930. Real national income per capita rose by 55.2 percent between those years. Given that

there was roughly an 8 percent improvement in the black-white income ratio in those years (Smith

1984) real national income per capita may have risen by 54.8 percent for blacks.21 Assuming

an elasticity of 1.8 this would lead to a 98.7 percent increase in retirement rates. In the South

retirement rates rose from 13 to 25 percent between 1900 and 1930. Increases in incomes imply

that retirement rates should have been 26 percent in 1930. Rising incomes cannot explain patterns

in headship among retirees prior to 1930 – headship rates among black retirees fell between 1900

and 1930. If rising retirement is unaccompanied by independent living, even though I have shown

that independent living is a normal good, then perhaps retirement rates rose because of economic

dislocation.22

       Rising wealth cannot account for the black-white convergence in retirement rates observed

between 1930 and 1950. Most of the convergence occurred between 1930 and 1940. But national

income fell between 1929 and 1939. Census data show that between 1930 and 1940 the fraction

of non-farm men age 45 to 54 owning a home fell by 4 percentage points among whites and by

almost 6 percentage points among blacks. The real value of housing wealth fell by 30 percent for

whites and by 36 percent for blacks (estimated from the Integrated Public Use Census Samples).

       I estimate the impact of the institution of Social Security on the retirement rates of blacks

and whites by examining how retirement rates of whites and blacks in the south (where most
  21
      Per capita assessed wealth statistics are available for only a few states and are not available after World War I.
Margo (1984) finds that there was considerable variation across states. In North Carolina per capita assessed wealth
between 1900 and 1910 rose by 26 percent for whites and by 74 percent for blacks. However in Louisiana (a state
affected by the boll weevil) white assessed wealth rose by 33 percent and black assessed wealth rose by 10 percent.
   22
      Lange, Olmstead, and Rhode (2007) document how the boll weevil reduced cotton yields, the staple crop of the
South.

in its 1950 form. The Social Security Act of 1935 included two programs targeting the elderly

– Old Age Assistance (OAA), a need based program which made federal subsidies available to

states with Old Age Assistance programs, and Old Age Insurance, which in 1939 became Old Age

and Survivors’ Insurance (OASI). In 1950 73 percent of all combined expenditures on Old Age

and Survivors’ Insurance and Old Age Assistance went to Old Age Assistance. OAA recipiency

expanded sharply between 1940 and 1950, particularly in the southern states where most blacks

were located. By 1950 at most 9 percent of men older than 64 were collecting OASI, whereas 23

percent of all elderly were collecting OAA.23

       Convergence in black-white retirement rates between 1930 and 1950 was greater in the states

that instituted a more generous OAA program. Using published census data for the 17 states that

provided statistics on the non-white labor force, I regressed the change in the state difference in

white-black retirement rates between 1930 and 1950 on the average yearly OAA payment and

recipiency rate in 1950. (Published census data was used because of sample size considerations.)

The coefficient on OAA payments divided by 100 was -0.021 (σ̂ =0.007) and the coefficient on

recipiency rates was 0.075 (σ̂ =0.053). When I regressed the change in the state difference in

white-black retirement rates between 1930 and 1940 on the average yearly OAA payment in 1940

and recipiency rate in 1940, I obtained a coefficient of -0.020 (σ̂ =0.008) on the OAA payment

divided by 100 and a coefficient of 0.042 on the recipiency rate (σ̂ =0.054). When I regressed

the change in the state difference in white-black retirement rates between 1940 and 1950 on the

difference in real average yearly OAA payments divided by 100 and recipiency rates between 1940

and 1950, I obtained a coefficient of -0.016 (σ̂ =0.009) on the difference in OAA payments and a

coefficient of -0.136 (σ̂ =0.059) on the difference in recipiency rates. When I controlled for the

difference in state unemployment rates (unavailable for 1930), the coefficient on the difference in

Old Age Assistance was incorporated into Supplemental Security Income.

OAA payments remained statistically significant at the 10 percent level of significance.

       Had OAA been instituted in its 1950 form in 1930, results from the Union Army sample imply

that the difference in retirement rates between blacks and whites in the south would have fallen

by up to 54 percent. Given the population distribution of blacks and whites in the southern states,

average monthly OAA payments in 1910 dollars were $10.50 for blacks and $11.40 for whites.

Average OAA recipiency rates were 37.4 percent for blacks and 35.0 percent for whites.24 Using

the 1900 IV estimates of the percentage point increase in retirement rates for a dollar increase in

pension income of 2.4 for blacks (see Table 7) and of 1.1 for whites (Costa 1995, 1995, 1998: 46),

retirement rates in the south would have risen from 25.5 to 34.9 percent for blacks and from 37

to 41.4 percent for whites, thus explaining 54 percent of the initial difference in retirement rates

(=(41.4-34.9)/(37.0-25.5)). Using estimates of the average treatment effect on the treated derived

from the 1910 comparison of veterans and non-veterans (Table 2), the difference in retirement rates

would have fallen by only 7 percent. Because OAA as a means tested program included large work

disincentives, the pure income effect estimated from Union Army pensions may underestimate the

effect of OAA on retirement rates. (However, because OAA was targeted toward the poor who

might not have enough income to retire, this will lead to an upward bias.) Differences in retirement

rates that cannot be explained by the income effects and work disincentives of Social Security may

be explained by changes in labor demand.

       Instituting OAA in its 1950 form in 1930 would have reduced the difference in black and white

headship rates of retirees up to 43 percent. In 1930 49 percent of southern black retirees headed

their own household compared to 56 percent of southern white retirees, a difference of 7 percentage

points. Using the estimates of the average treatment effects on the treated derived from the 1910

comparison of veterans and non-veterans (Table 10) and average southern recipiency rates and

payouts implies that headship rates would have risen to 53.3 percent for retired blacks and to 56.8
  24
     Estimated from Table 1 in Friedberg (1999). Because blacks were over-represented on the OAA rolls relative to
their size in the population (Friedberg 1999) recipiency rates for blacks are under-estimated.

9 Conclusion

Most studies of black economic progress have focused on prime-aged men (e.g. Donohue and

Heckman 1991; Margo 1990; Smith and Welch 1989). Less is known about long-run trends in

the economic status of the elderly and even if rates of retirement and independent living can be

used as indicators of well-being is uncertain. The Union Army pension program provided me with

the unique opportunity to examine the effect of an exogenous, unearned income transfer on the

retirement rates and living arrangements of African Americans at the beginning of the twentieth

century and therefore to show that retirement and independent living were normal goods not just

for whites but also for blacks. In fact, blacks were even more responsive to income than whites

in making their retirement and living arrangement decisions. There is no evidence of historical

differences in norms of work or co-residence dating either to slavery or African traditions (cf.

Ruggles 1994). This European pattern differs from that observed in South Africa where pensions

have had no effect on independent living (Edmonds, Mammen, and Miller 2005) but is similar to

that observed in Brazil (Carvalho 2000). Black rates of retirement and independent living were

low prior to 1940 because they could not afford to retire and, when retired, to live independently

of their children.

   Social concern over the plight of the elderly poor remains timely. Comparisons of alternative

Social Security reform proposals consider the effects of these reforms on African Americans be-

cause they are more dependent on Social Security than whites (e.g. Liebman 2002). Looking to

the past suggests that government played a large role in improving the economic status of elderly

African Americans. My results implied that income effects from the institution of Social Security

explain up to half of the convergence in black-white retirement rates and in living arrangements

Public Use Micro Sample for 1910 (IPUMS), except for the sample labeled Expanded IPUMS which includes black
veterans from the Union Army sample. All estimated using the IPUMS were obtained using the sampling weights.
Results for the Expanded IPUMS sample are given using both weights (=72 for men from the Union Army sample)
and no weights. Matches were obtained by deriving propensity scores from a probit regression of veteran status on
age, the log of population in the area of residence, dummies for literacy, marital status, whether the man was residing
on a farm, whether the man was the head of the household, whether the man owned property, and whether any children
were living with the man, and state fixed effects. The propensity scores were then used in nearest neighbor matching
with a caliper of 0.1 and with no replacement. The sample “Black, IPUMS” contains 204 black Union veterans and
3,768 black non-veterans. The sample “Black, Expanded IPUMS” adds black veterans from the Union Army sample
and contains 678 veterans and 3,799 non-veterans. The sample “Northern-born and Pre-Civil War Immigrant Whites,
IPUMS” consists of whites born in a northern state or foreign-born whites who immigrated before 1865. The sample
has 3,115 Union veterans and 22,187 non-veterans. The sample “Southern-born Whites, IPUMS” consists of whites
born in a Confederate state and has 1,161 Confederate veterans and 5,373 non-veterans. Bootstrap standard errors
were calculated for all weighted samples and all matched samples.

The sample was restricted to non-institutionalized men and contains 885 observations (142 rejectees and 743 pen-
sioners). Matches for ”IPUMS-style variables” were obtained by deriving propensity scores from a probit regression
of veteran status on age, the log of population in the area of residence, dummies for literacy, marital status, whether
the man was residing on a farm, whether the man was the head of the household, whether the man owned property,
and whether any children were living with the man, and area of residence (either a state or a region) fixed effects.
Matches for ”Additional variables” added occupation (current occupation for non-retirees and past occupation for re-
tirees), BMI and BMI squared and four dummies indicating whether the veteran had difficulty walking or bending and
whether he was paralyzed or blind. Sample size falls to 877 men (142 rejectees and 735 pensioners). The propensity
scores were then used in nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.1 and with no replacement. Bootstrap standard
errors were calculated for the matched sample. For the matched sample of pensioners, the monthly pension amount
was $8.60.

The control variables for both the probit model and the instrumented probit model are age; two dummies indicating
occupation (artisan, professional, or proprietor and laborer with farmer as the omitted dummy); a dummy equal to
one if the veteran was married; BMI and BMI squared; four dummies indicating whether the veteran had difficulty
walking or bending and whether he was paralyzed or blind; dummies indicating literacy, propety ownership, whether
the veteran had been wounded in the war, whether the veteran was free at the time of enlistment, whether the veteran
lived on a farm, and whether there were any children present in the household; the logarithm of town population; and,
area of residence fixed effects (equal to either a state or a region). The instrumental variable is a dummy equal to one
if the veteran applied under the general law in 1900. There are 877 observations in the 1900 regression and 542 in the
1910 regression.

     are unweighted. All other sample results are weighted. Matches were obtained by deriving propensity scores from a probit regression of veteran status
     on age, the log of population in the area of residence, dummies for literacy, marital status, whether the man was residing on a farm, whether the man was
     the head of the household, whether the man owned property, and whether any children were living with the man, and state fixed effects. The propensity
     scores were then used in nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.1 and with no replacement. The sample “Black, IPUMS” contains 204 black
     Union veterans and 3,768 black non-veterans. The sample “Black, Expanded IPUMS” adds black veterans from the Union Army sample and contains
     678 veterans and 3,799 non-veterans. The sample “Northern-born and Pre-Civil War Immigrant Whites, IPUMS” consists of whites born in a northern
     state or foreign-born whites who immigrated before 1865. The sample has 3,115 Union veterans and 22,187 non-veterans. The sample “Southern-born
     Whites, IPUMS” consists of whites born in a Confederate state and has 1,161 Confederate veterans and 5,373 non-veterans. Bootstrap standard errors in

Estimated from the Integrated Public Use Census and Current Population Survey Micro Samples (IPUMS) for non-
institutionalized men using the gainful definition of labor force participation until 1940 and the current definition of
labor force participation beginning in 1940. The series giving the percentage of household heads ends in 2000 because
in 2000 the percentages calculated from the census and the CPS no longer corespond. In the census, the ”householder”
designation is entirely up to respondents. They identify the householder when they fill out the form. The CPS is based
upon phone interviews and it is quite plausible that, as the BLS staff is interviewing a woman, they would put her as
the householder and list her husband as the spouse.

Estimated from a local linear regression of pension amount on age using Nichol’s (2007) rd Stata module. The age
used is age as inferred from the pension and military service records. The estimated jumps in pension amount using
a bandwidth of 20 at ages 70 and 75 are $2.52 (σ̂ =0.73) and $1.53 (σ̂ =2.30). When age as given in the census is
used the estimated jumps in pension amount using a bandwith of 20 age 70 and 75 are $1.94 (σ̂ =0.79) and $0.86
(σ̂ =1.06).

Estimated from a local linear regression of a dummy equal to one if the person was retired on age using Nichol’s (2007)
rd Stata module. The age used is age as given in the 1910 census. The estimated jump in retirement probabilities
for veterans at age 70 is 0.042 (σ̂ =0.047) and the estimated jump in retirement probabilities at age 71 is 0.071
(σ̂ =0.060). The estimated jump in retirement probabilities for non-veterans at age 70 is 0.015 (σ̂ =0.022) and at age
71 the estimated jump is -0.003(σ̂ =0.028).
