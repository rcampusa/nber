The Impact of Minimum Wage Rates on Body Weight in the United States

                                            ABSTRACT

Growing consumption of increasingly less expensive food, and especially “fast food”, has been cited
as a potential cause of increasing rate of obesity in the United States over the past several decades.
Because the real minimum wage in the United States has declined by as much as half over 1968-2007
and because minimum wage labor is a major contributor to the cost of food away from home we hypothesized
that changes in the minimum wage would be associated with changes in bodyweight over this period.
To examine this, we use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 1984-2006
to test whether variation in the real minimum wage was associated with changes in body mass index
(BMI). We also examine whether this association varied by gender, education and income, and used
quantile regression to test whether the association varied over the BMI distribution. We also estimate
the fraction of the increase in BMI since 1970 attributable to minimum wage declines. We find that
a $1 decrease in the real minimum wage was associated with a 0.06 increase in BMI. This relationship
was significant across gender and income groups and largest among the highest percentiles of the BMI
distribution. Real minimum wage decreases can explain 10% of the change in BMI since 1970. We
conclude that the declining real minimum wage rates has contributed to the increasing rate of overweight
and obesity in the United States. Studies to clarify the mechanism by which minimum wages may
affect obesity might help determine appropriate policy responses.

Since 1970, the rate of obesity in the US increased from about 14% to over 25% and has

come to be recognized as a major public health concern.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9   Understanding the

causes of obesity is important because it may suggest strategies to address the increase

in obesity. Increases in body weight are the result of an excess of caloric intake relative

to caloric expenditure. Changes in both caloric expenditure and caloric intake have been

hypothesized to have contributed to increasing obesity in the United States. Factors that

have been suggested to have decreased caloric expenditure include the development of

a more sedentary lifestyle due to the decreasing role of physical labor in work and

increasingly sedentary nature of leisure activities due to the growth of television and

video games. Factors affecting food consumption that have been emphasized include

the greater consumption of “fast food” away from home and the declining cost of eating a

diverse set of foods at home due to the increased availability of low-cost prepared and

highly processed foods.10,11,12,13




The consumption of fast food has received particular attention as a cause of obesity.

Chou, Grossman and Saffer (2004) found that people who live in closer proximity to

fast food restaurants are more likely to be obese.14       However, this finding might not

reflect a causal effect of the presence of fast food restaurants on obesity but instead a

tendency for fast food restaurants to locate in areas where the demand for their products

will be greater. Even if this association were viewed to reflect a causal effect of fast food

restaurants on obesity, it would not explain why the number of fast food restaurants


                                                                                           1
should have increased.




Because minimum wage labor makes up about one third of the cost of fast food and

because the real minimum wage has varied nationally and across states over time due to

changes in state and federal minimum wage laws and inflation that would not seem to

have any independent reasons to affect obesity, variation in real minimum wages may

provide a powerful mechanism to provide a test for the hypothesis that fast food

consumption may play a role in increasing obesity in the United States. While the

variation in the real minimum wage across states over time is the critical element for this

test of the hypothesis, the fact that the real minimum wage in 2007 constant dollars fell

from a maximum of about $9.15 in 1968 to a low of about $5.80 in 2007 suggests that it

is possible that the decline in real minimum wage itself may have played a role in the

long-term increase in obesity over this period.15 Although our analysis does not support

a direct test of the hypothesis that a decline in the minimum wage could affect obesity by

increasing the consumption of fast food, we complement this analysis in our discussion

by calibrating them against the results of other studies that have examined how declines

in the minimum wage would translated into lower prices for food away from

home 16 , 17 , 18 , 19   and how increased consumption of food away from home would

increase obesity.20 Since the results of this calibration exercise are similar in magnitude

to the results of our primary analysis of the association of minimum wages and obesity,

this helps provide confidence that the association we observe may reflect a causal


                                                                                         2
pathway to obesity through increased consumption of fast food.




METHODS

Real minimum wages were calculated using data on nominal minimum wages and

consumer price indices (CPI) from 1984-2006, the years for which our obesity data were

available. Nominal minimum wage data by state was obtained from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.21 We then calculated the real wage rates in 2006 dollars by dividing the

nominal wage rates by the census-region-specific all items CPI.22 Because most fast

food restaurants are part of chains that are classified as interstate commerce and are

therefore subject to Federal minimum wage legislation,23 we used the higher of the

Federal minimum wage and the state minimum wage. Figure 1 reports the trends in

mean nominal and real minimum wage rates across states weighted to reflect the

distribution of population in our obesity data, which is intended to be representative of the

US non-institutionalized adult population. The pattern of changes in these average real

minimum wages reflects a combination of Federal nominal minimum wages increases in

1990 and 1996 (denoted by large squares) and multiple state increases over time, and

the tendency for inflation to erode the average real minimum wage in the absence of

legislated increases. Despite the two increases in the Federal minimum wage and

numerous increases in state minimum wages, the mean real minimum wage rate faced

by respondents in our sample declined from $6.40 in 1984 to $5.82 in 2006. Although

this overall change was modest, the powerful effect of the Federal minimum wage


                                                                                           3
caused much larger variations in average real minimum wages over shorter time periods.

For example, from September 1997 when the federal minimum was raised to $5.15 an

hour, to the end of the period studied the average real minimum wage fell from $6.47 to

$5.82.   Seventeen states had state minimum wage rates above the federal minimum

wage by April 2006. Oregon, Vermont, and Washington automatically adjust minimum

wage rates each year using state consumer price indices.21




We studied the effects of these minimum wage changes among respondents to the

Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1984-2006.24 The BRFSS

surveys health risk behaviors among non-institutionalized American civilian adults age

18 and older and is the most commonly used source of data for national studies of

obesity and physical activity in the United States.14 Data for BRFSS is collected by state

health departments using computer assisted telephone interviewing with coordination by

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When data collection for BRFSS began,

only 15 states participated. However, by 1994, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and

3 territories participated.




The 1984-2006 BRFSS includes 3,256,947 valid interview records. We excluded

pregnant women (33,385) and records with missing information on weight, height, and

key confounding factors (165,410). We also excluded records with values of body mass

index (BMI) (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) that we considered


                                                                                         4
implausible: 863 with BMI < 14 and 8,911 with BMI > 50. This left a final study sample of

3,048,378, individuals with complete information. The BRFSS group provides a final

sampling weight to control for the sampling bias.24 Figure 2 illustrates the trend of the

weighted mean of BMI and proportion of obesity individual among the BRFSS sample

and sub-samples by gender group.




Statistical Analysis

    Multivariable linear regression models were used to study the effects of the real

minimum wage on BMI. Regressions controlled for race and ethnicity, age, marital status,

education, income, state fixed effects, and year effects, with coding as described in Table

1. Categories for household income interval indicators were obtained from the original

surveys. Due to changes in survey design over time, the indicator for household income

greater than $50,000 applies only to responses after 1984, and the indicator for income

greater than $75,000 applies only from 1994-2006. We assign zero to these variables

when they are not applicable. Because the categorical nature of these income variables

makes adjustment for inflation difficult, we include interaction terms of categorical

income indicators and years. In addition, we also examined specifications that did not

include income and that interacted income with indicators for time period. Furthermore,

because the minimum wage could have a direct effect on income, especially for low

income persons,25 we also examined specifications that divided the sample into high

and low income groups. We estimated all models on the full sample and on male and


                                                                                         5
female samples separately. Because health status and weight may decline with

advancing age and more rapidly among older persons, we also estimated models

without persons older than 60. Robust or Huber-White errors are used in calculating the

confidence intervals and the p-values to account for serial correlation and state/year

clustering in the linear models.14,26

    Because we expected that the effects of the minimum wage on bodyweight might not

be uniform across different parts of the bodyweight distribution, we also examined BMI

using quantile regression models.

    Statistical analyses were performed using the survey data analysis commands of

Stata software, version 9 (Stata Corporation).




Results

    The summary statistics are presented in Table 1. Over the study period, the average

BMI is 25.8 for the full sample, 26.4 for males, and 25.2 for females. The percentage of

obese individuals is roughly 17% for the full sample and for both genders. The weighted

mean age is 44.8 for full sample but the male sample is significantly younger than the

female sample. This presumably reflects the greater life expectancy of females.

    Table 2 provides the estimates of the linear regression models for BMI. The results

suggest that a one-dollar increase in minimum wage is associated with a 0.06 decrease

in mean BMI. The results for male and female samples separately are similar.

    Quantile regression results showed that the effects vary by BMI, with the effects


                                                                                       6
increasing steadily across the BMI distribution to a maximum effect of one dollar

increase in the real minimum wage on BMI of 0.13 in the 90th percentile. Results were

again similar when men and women were analyzed separately.




Contribution of Minimum Wage Decreases to Increasing BMI and Obesity.

   During the period covered by the BRFSS data, the average real minimum wage fell

from a maximum of $6.40 in 1984 to $5.82 in 2006, with the Federal minimum real wage

falling even further, from $6.30 to $5.20. From when the Federal minimum wage was last

increased during our study period (1997) to the conclusion of our study period in 2006,

the average real minimum wage fell from $6.50 to $5.82 and the real value of the Federal

minimum wage fell from $6.40 to $5.20. Multiplying these changes in the average real

wage by the estimates from the linear model suggest that the $0.58 decline in the real

minimum wage from 1984 to 2006 would produce a $0.58 x 0.06 = 0.035 increase in BMI.

Since average BMI increased by about 2.6 from 1984 to 2006 (from about 24.4 to 27.0),

this is only 1-2% of the increase in BMI over the period. If we consider the most recent

period during which the real minimum wage has been continuingly decreasing,

1997-2006, the $0.68 decline can explain 0.68 × 0.06 = 0.04 (4%) of the 1.3 (25.7 to 27)

increase in BMI. However, both these periods exclude the major decline in the real

minimum wage that occurred from about 1970 to 1984. If the longer term $3.33 decline in

the real minimum wage from its peak at $9.15 in 1968 to $5.82 in 2006 is considered, it

can explain 3.33 × 0.06 = 0.2 (10%) of the total increase in average BMI from 25.0 to


                                                                                       7
27.0 over the period.5,27

    Table 3 presents results of the sensitivity analysis. The first two specifications show

that the results are robust to whether they include the controls for income. Specifications

3 and 4 show the results are stronger for persons below age 60 than for older persons.

Specifications 5-8 show that, excluding persons older than 60 in whom income is more

likely to be a misleading measure of financial resources, the effects of minimum wage on

BMI are greatest among persons with at least a high school education and with incomes

above $30,000.




Discussion

    The association we observe between changes in the real minimum wage and BMI

among BRFSS respondents are consistent with our hypothesis that a decrease in real

minimum wages can increase bodyweight. Although we cannot prove that this

relationship is causal, several lines of evidence argue against alternative interpretations,

such as that changes in body weight influence real wages or that a third factor influences

both real wages and body weight. The first possibility seems unlikely because there is no

apparent reason why changes in obesity would cause changes in minimum wage laws or

inflation. It does seem possible that some third factor could lead to both decreases in the

real minimum wage and increases in BMI. One candidate might be that falling incomes

within states that we somehow do not adequately control for could both cause states to

allow the minimum wage to drift downward and lead to increases in obesity if declines in


                                                                                          8
socioeconomic status due to falling incomes caused people to substitute cheaper but

more fattening foods for more expensive ones that are less likely to cause obesity.

Arguing against this is that we control for both state effects and time trends, so that

changes in state minimum wage legislation or local price levels would have to be

explained by changes in income over time within states. We also performed additional

sensitivity analyses that included state-specific time linear time trends and these

generally confirmed our overall findings, though these specifications did have difficulties

converging in some of the quantile regressions.

    The hypothesis that changes in the minimum real wage could cause changes in

obesity, in contrast, seems highly plausible. Here there are at least two stories one could

tell. The first is the one that we have emphasized -- that decreases in the minimum wage

would lower the price of fast food and thereby increase its consumption and thus obesity.

The second is that a decrease in the minimum wage could raise obesity by lowering

incomes of people who earn minimum wage and encouraging them to eat more

unhealthy food. However, this second argument is not a convincing explanation of the

results we observe because the effect of the minimum wage is greater among high

income persons than among low income persons, who would be most likely to earn

minimum wage. In addition, low income persons consume so little food away from home,

(<$250 per family of four per year), that it seems unlikely to be enough to contribute to

obesity.28 In addition, it is interesting that even though lower income persons are more

likely than higher income persons to be obese, 29,30,31      obesity has increased most


                                                                                         9
among higher income persons in recent years, as might be expected if changes in the

price of food away from home were driving increases in obesity.32

      Further evidence supporting the hypothesis that the decline in real minimum wage

has increased obesity by encouraging food away from home (FAFH) is that the effect we

observe can be assessed by calibrating it against the published literature on how the

price of food away from home affects the quantity of it consumed and how that, in turn

affects obesity. To do this, the effect of the minimum wage on BMI can be approximated

by:

∆ BMI / ∆ minimum wage =        ∆ BMI / %∆ calories intake

                            · %∆ calories intake/ %∆ quantity of FAFH

                            · %∆ quantity of FAFH / %∆ price FAFH

                            · %∆ price FAFH / %∆ minimum wage

Assuming a median height of person in the US of 1.78 meters and average caloric intake

of about 2000 calories per day and estimates by Cutler, Glaeser and Shapiro10 that the

approximately 5 kg (= 1.6 BMI unit) increase in median weight over past two decades

requires a net caloric imbalance of about 100 - 150 calories per day, the change in BMI

per percent increase in caloric intake can estimated as (5 ÷1.782) ÷ (125/2000) = 25.

Estimates of the elasticity of FAFH with respect to price are available from a recent study

on demand of food consumption, which suggested estimates of price elasticity as from

−2.03 to −1.16.1,20     Estimating how total calories consumed increases as FAFH

increases is difficult because FAFH may substitute for food at home. However, assuming


                                                                                        10
it does not places an upper bound on the increase in total calories. Aaronson and

colleagues have provided fairly consistent estimates of the effect of minimum wage on

food price, ranging from elasticity estimates of 0.73% for full service establishment to

1.56% for limited service establishment for ten percent change of minimum wage. An

alternative study suggested that 1% change of food price per $0.50 change in minimum

wage rate, consistent again with about a 1% change.19 Multiplying these (25 × (-1 to -2) ×

0.01 = -0.25 to -0.48, about five times the size of the 0.06 effect we estimate. This seems

likely to reflect the extent to which our calculations fail to account to the extent to which

calories for FAFH reduce calories consumed at home, but suggests that the hypothesis

that increased consumption of food away from home could explain the increase in

bodyweight we find with increases in the minimum wage even if as little as 20% of the

increase in calories consumed away from home represents a net increase in total caloric

consumption.

    Our analysis has several limitations. First, BRFSS bodyweight and height

information was self-reported, which could lead to bias in estimates of weight and

height.33 However, there is no obvious reason why such bias would change our findings.

Another limitation is that BRFSS excludes children and youth, institutionalized

populations and households without phone service. Finally, our analysis assumes that

changes in minimum wages affect obesity currently and it may well be that there is some

lag structure to effects that we have failed to account for and would be complex to

implement empirically given the serial correlation of wages within states over time.


                                                                                          11
Potential Policy Implications

    If the decline in minimum wages has contributed to increasing obesity in the United

States then it is tempting to consider whether increases in the minimum wage might

reduce obesity in the United States, producing benefits in both better health and lower

health care costs. Indeed, the Federal real minimum wage has already increased by

about 40% since 2006. Real minimum wages would have to rise by an additional 60% to

restore them to their 1968 levels, and such increases could have adverse effects on

employment, companies that depend on minimum wage labor, and the prices of other

goods and services that are heavily dependent on minimum wage labor.34,35,36

    To put the potential policy implications of a minimum wage increase in context, it is

useful to consider the expected effects of minimum wage on health outcomes, such as

mortality. Precisely forecasting the effects of a minimum wage change on mortality is

complex because minimum wage may change obesity differently across different groups

and those changes may have varying effects on health outcomes across those groups.8

However, using published estimates that there is an average reduction in life expectancy

of about 6 months with each 1 unit increase in BMI,37 the change of 0.07 over the

population for each dollar increase in the minimum wage would increase life expectancy

in the United States by 15 days, producing an additional 12 million life-years over the US

population. To the extent that BMI would decrease most among the most obese, as

suggested by our quantile regressions, and that the health benefits of BMI reduction


                                                                                       12
would be greatest at the highest levels of BMI, these estimates of the mortality

reductions from an increase in the real minimum wage would be conservative

    Were an increase in the minimum wage to be viewed as a health intervention, it

would be useful to consider its benefits from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. As a

back of the envelope calculation, using common estimates that a year of life is valued at

$100,00038 and assuming that the added year of life would occur on average 40 years

from now (since the average age of the U.S. population is slightly above 35 and life

expectancy at birth is slightly above 75),39 and discounting future benefits at 3%,40 this

increase in life expectancy would be valued at about $375 Billion. Reductions in

morbidity with decreasing levels of obesity have also been quantified and are probably

roughly on the same order of magnitude as reductions in mortality.41 Health care costs

related to obesity are smaller, probably less than $50 billion annually, so the value of

these savings would be small compared to the value of health improvements. 42,43

Dividing these benefits that would accrue across all cohorts evenly among all the cohorts

suggests an annual health benefit valued at about $50 billion. The total of these societal

benefit is clearly very large but need to be interpreted in light of an estimated annual cost

of a one dollar increase in minimum wage increases of about $195 Billion per year

assuming that there are 13 million minimum wage workers who each work about 1,500

hours per year.44 This suggests that an increase in the minimum wage would cost

consumers on average more than they would gain in health benefits, but does not

include the benefits to minimum wage workers. To the extent these are transfer


                                                                                          13
payments from consumers paying higher costs for minimum wage earners, such benefits

to minimum wage earners would completely offset the costs of a minimum wage

increase. However, to the extent higher minimum wages induce unemployment or other

inefficiencies in labor and product markets, a result suggested by classical

microeconomic theory but still controversial empirically,45 such losses would have to be

viewed as arguing against increases in the minimum wage. Unfortunately, estimates of

the magnitude of such welfare losses due to a higher minimum wage are not available.

For this reason, and because an increase in the minimum wage might have a series of

complex distributional effects on different subgroups in the population, recommendations

about the desirability of a further increase in the minimum wage are beyond the scope of

this paper.

    Whether or not additional minimum wage increases would be a desirable policy

option, our results may have important policy implications if they focus attention on the

mechanisms by which an increase in the minimum wage might affect obesity. While we

have emphasized food away from home, we recognize that other explanations could be

produced. For example, it is possible that prices for food at home could also be

influenced by changes in the minimum wage, though this seems less likely given the

smaller share for minimum wage labor in the manufacture of food at home. If we are

willing to focus on the price of food away form home as a determinant of obesity then

perhaps policy changes such as better labeling, public health education, regulation of

serving size, or “sin taxes” on food away from home might worth greater attention.46

Although prior studies have suggested association between obesity and increased

consumption of food away from home, the direction of causation has been unclear. Our

findings on the relationship of obesity to minimum wage changes support the argument

that association of increased consumption of food away from home and obesity may

reflect a causal relationship. Our results also increase the importance of experiments to

test approaches to control obesity by changing the consumption of food away from home,

whether through changes in prices, availability, or information about health

consequences.

    That our findings explain only a moderate percent of the observed change in

bodyweight suggest that other explanations, such as decreased physical activity, may

also play important roles in the increase in obesity. Peer effects have also recently

received significant attention in the literature,47,48 though these would presumably be

reflected in the total response we observe in response to a change in the minimum wage,

only perhaps more broadly distributed over time. Peer effects also cannot explain why a

trend towards increasing obesity may have started; it is possible that decreases in the

minimum wage may have had local effects that explain only 10-20% of the increase in

BMI as we identify here, but larger effects across the country through peer effects that

we are unable to identify using the approach we apply here. Finally, we should note that

labor saving approaches to the production of fast food have presumably also played a

major role in decreasing its cost and increasing its consumption. To the extent such labor

saving continues, minimum wage labor may be an increasingly less important contributor


                                                                                        15
to the cost of food away from home over time regardless of wage increases. While this

may decrease the potential impact of minimum wage policies on obesity, our findings

highlight the possibility that policies that focus on the consumption of food away from

home deserve particular attention in public health efforts to control obesity.
