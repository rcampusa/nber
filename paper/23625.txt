Behavioral economics lacks empirical evidence on some foundational empirical questions. We
adapt standard elicitation methods to measure multiple behavioral factors per person in a
representative U.S. sample, along with financial condition, cognitive skills, financial literacy,
classical preferences and demographics. Individually, B-factors are prevalent, distinct from other
decision inputs, and correlate negatively with financial outcomes in richly-conditioned
regressions. Conditioning further on other B-factors does not change the results, validating
common practice of modeling B-factors separately. Corrections for low task/survey effort
modestly strengthen the results. Our findings provide bedrock empirical foundations for
behavioral economics, and offer methodological guidance for research designs.

    Behavioral economics (BE) is in the zeitgeist. Researchers have identified a panoply of
behavioral biases that could affect decisions and outcomes, typically starting with lab-based
direct elicitation methods that measure a bias using stylized tasks. Micro- and macroeconomists
alike have incorporated behavioral specifications of preferences, expectations, and problem-
solving approaches into models. Policymakers now invoke BE as a basis for specific
rulemakings and broader regulatory authority. “Nudge units” and other centers of applied
behavioral social sciences are multiplying. 1

    Yet many economists remain skeptical of the economic importance and usefulness of BE. 2
This skepticism is warranted by the lack of nationally representative empirical evidence on some
foundational questions.

    First, are behavioral biases prevalent enough in broad populations to merit thorough and
continued examination? Perhaps not, if biases are truly anomalous. Yet our literature reviews of
direct elicitation work on 17 prominently-researched behavioral factors (“B-factors”) indicates
that many biases have only been measured in non-representative samples. 10 of the 17 B-factors
we consider lack even a single prevalence estimate from nationally representative U.S. data.

    Second, does cross-sectional heterogeneity in B-factors shows meaningful links to individual
decisions and outcomes? Perhaps not, if learning, market forces, delegation, and/or policy
protections neutralize behavioral tendencies. Yet our literature reviews again find scant prior
evidence on the question: 14 of 17 B-factors lack even a single estimate, from U.S.
representative data, of links between field outcomes and a behavioral bias conditional on
cognitive skills and other “classical factors” such as risk aversion, patience, age, gender, income,
education and others.

    Third, are B-factors distinct from each other, in terms of their relationships to field behavior
and outcomes? Not necessarily, if bias on one dimension is correlated with bias on others,
within-person. 3 Yet most prior work in BE, both theory and empirics, analyzes one or two B-

Dean and Ortoleva (2016) in a sample of university students.

factors in isolation from the many others. The validity of that practice, and the extent to which
one can rely on findings from prior work, hinges on B-factor separability assumptions that have
yet to be tested in representative data. 4

    And fourth, are B-factors distinct from other decision inputs? There are many dimensions to
this question, and here we are primarily interested in two. One relates to research design: which
other decision inputs should researchers consider when trying to identify relationships between
B-factors and field outcomes? The second relates to the underpinnings of behavioral biases
themselves: how well fit are they by other individual characteristics? Specifically, prior work
often groups or links B-factors with other individual characteristics like cognitive skills, standard
preferences, and demographics, but those approaches have questionable merit if behavioral
factors capture information that measures of classical factors do not.

    We provide new evidence on these foundational questions for 17 B-factors. One set of B-
factors relates to preferences: present-biased discounting (Read and van Leeuwen 1998;
Andreoni and Sprenger 2012), loss aversion (Fehr and Goette 2007), preference for certainty
(Callen et al. 2014), ambiguity aversion (Dimmock et al. 2016), and choice inconsistency (Choi
et al. 2014). Other B-factors capture biased beliefs, biased perceptions, and behavioral decision
rules: three varieties of overconfidence (Moore and Healy 2008), narrow bracketing (Matthew
Rabin and Weizsäcker 2009), exponential growth biases (Stango and Zinman 2009; Levy and
Tasoff 2016), statistical fallacies (Dohmen et al. 2009; Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin 2013;
Benjamin, Rabin, and Raymond 2016), and limited attention/memory (Ericson 2011). We
selected B-factors by drawing on recent direct elicitation papers in top economics and finance
journals, consulting with seminar and conference audiences during the design phase of the
project, and making some allowances for tractability. 5

  For work and discussions re: interactions among behavioral factors and other challenges in behavioral
modeling, see, e.g., the cites in footnotes 1-3, and also Benjamin et al. (2016), Ericson (forthcoming),
Heidhues et al. (2016), and O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999).

  This paragraph cites the papers that had the greatest influence on our elicitation designs. With respect to
drawing the line on what we did and did not seek to measure, some examples of tractability
considerations are that we could not devise methods for eliciting projection bias or confirmation bias that
seemed feasible given our budget constraint and other measurement priorities. If unconstrained we also
would have elicited social preferences; given constraints this seemed like a natural line of demarcation, as
in e.g., Gabaix (2014, 2017).

                                                                                                           2
    We can elicit a large set of B-factors because we streamline standard direct elicitation
methods by shortening, simplifying and combining tasks/questions. Streamlining elicitations
saves costs/time and allows us to construct an unusually rich, person-level dataset capturing
behavioral tendencies, other decision inputs, and field choices/outcomes. Specifically, we
measure 17 B-factors per person, together with classical factors— patience and risk attitudes,
demographics that capture human capital and life-cycle inputs, cognitive skills including
financial literacy— and financial choices/outcomes. Altogether we measure a broad set of B-
factors, other decision inputs, and outcomes.

    We implement our elicitations as part of two online survey modules administered to a
nationally representative U.S. sample of 1400+ participants in RAND’s American Life Panel
(ALP) in 2014-15. The two modules take about 60 minutes per respondent in total. Respondents
are compensated for completing each module, per the ALP’s standard practice, and we offered
additional compensation for only one of our many B-factor and cognitive tasks.

    Measurement error concerns have shaped every step of this project, with no fewer than a
dozen features of our research design and data helping us deal with classical or non-classical
measurement error. Ex-ante, our design choices were influenced by findings that the presence or
absence of marginal financial incentives need not change inferences about B-factors, 6 and by the
success of previous work adapting lab elicitations for administration in surveys. 7 Additionally,
our survey formatting discourages the production of mechanical relationships between B-factor
measures and financial condition measures. Ex-post, we find nearly all respondents reporting that
the elicitations are interesting, that standard internal consistency checks produce results
comparable to prior work, and that B-factor prevalence does not vary with the amount of time
respondents spend on elicitation tasks. Nor do we find unusually high B-factor prevalence, in
cases where prior work provides comparable estimates. These patterns assuage the concern that
lack of respondent effort will spuriously inflate B-factor prevalence. We moreover control for

  For recent evidence on whether financial incentives change behavioral parameter estimates see, e.g.,
Von Gaudecker et al. (2011) and Gneezy et al. (2015). Unpaid tasks (with hypothetical rewards) may
even offer some conceptual advantages (Cohen et al. 2016), as may simpler/shorter tasks (Chuang and
Schechter 2015).

  On behavioral biases see, e.g., Ashraf et al. (2006), Callen et al. (2014), Choi et al. (2014), and Gine et
al. (forthcoming); on classical preferences, expectations, and decision rules see, e.g., Barsky et al. (1997),
Dohmen et al. (2010, 2011) and Falk et al. (2015; 2015).

                                                                                                            3
respondent survey effort—measured using time spent responding to B-factor elicitations—or
downweight low-effort respondents in some specifications. Theory helps as well, by generating
testable predictions—that certain directional biases (“standard” ones like over-confidence, and
present-bias) should be more prevalent and predictive than others (“non-standard” biases like
under-confidence, and future-bias). Those predictions find support in our data and are
inconsistent with alternative interpretations of B-factors as two-sided “mistakes” or noise. And
finally, our results linking B-factors to outcomes provide “proof is in the pudding” that classical
measurement error does not fully obscure valuable signals from our B-factor data.

    Further previewing our key results, on the first foundational question we find that most B-
factors are indeed quite prevalent, with some deviation from the classical norm exhibited by at
least 50% of the sample for 11 of the 17 B-factors. High prevalence is not simply an artifact of
“trembles,” or low survey effort; we find substantial prevalence even when applying stricter
standards for what counts as “behavioral,” or when discarding low-effort responses. Nor is high
prevalence an artifact of our streamlined elicitations: we actually classify fewer people as
behavioral than prior studies using comparable elicitation methods on representative U.S.
samples, for 5 of the 7 B-factors with prior comparable studies. 8 Standard directional biases
emphasized by prior literature (e.g., under-estimating exponential growth instead of over-
estimating it) are indeed more prevalent in our data, for 6 of the 7 B-factors where we can
capture bi-directional biases and there is a clear standard. Our main takeaways on the first
foundational question are that B-factors are widespread enough in the general population to
motivate continued scrutiny, and that our streamlined methods are useful for eliciting them.

    Turning to the second foundational question, we find that cross-sectional heterogeneity in B-
factors does in fact correlate with outcomes. As a threshold matter, we start by showing that
cross-sectional heterogeneity exists, to a substantial degree. In cases where comparable prior
estimates of B-factor (parameter) distributions exist, we find similar distributions. We also
document that, for each B-factor, there is at least some prior theory or empirical evidence

8
  By our accounting, the 7 B-factors with a nationally representative prevalence estimate for the U.S. in
prior work are: money discounting biases (Bradford et al. 2014; Goda et al. 2017), snack discounting
biases (Barcellos and Carvalho 2014), loss aversion (Hwang 2016), narrow bracketing (Gottlieb and
Mitchell 2015; Rabin and Weizsäcker 2009), ambiguity aversion (Dimmock et al. 2016), debt-side
exponential growth bias (Stango and Zinman 2009, 2011), and asset-side EGB (Levy and Tasoff 2016;
Goda et al. 2017). See Section 2-A and the Data Appendix for more details.

                                                                                                       4
suggesting links between that B-factor and worse financial condition. We then regress a rich
index of financial condition on each B-factor, conditional on measures of classical risk aversion
and patience; cognitive skills including financial literacy; income, age, gender, education, and
other demographics; and survey effort. As noted above, prior work lacks this sort of richly
conditioned test, in nationally representative U.S. data, for 14 of the 17 B-factors. 9 Overall, we
find that B-factors negatively correlate with financial condition, with economically significant
magnitudes. And, as with prevalence, bi-directional biases exhibit the pattern predicted by
theory: standard directional biases exhibit negative correlations, while non-standard biases do
not. Down-weighting observations reflecting low task/survey effort strengthens the results, albeit
modestly. Our main takeaway here is that B-factors do have economically substantial conditional
correlations with field outcomes.

    On the third foundational question, we provide new tests of whether B-factors are empirically
distinct from each other for each of the 17 B-factors. 10 The findings are striking: links between
single B-factors and financial condition are essentially invariant to whether one controls for
(even the full set of) other B-factors or not. These findings suggest that theorists are on firm
ground when modeling the influence of a single bias on (financial) decisions while abstracting
away from other potential biases. And empiricists interested in the relationship between a
particular bias and (financial) outcomes need not be overly concerned about omitting other B-


9
   By our accounting, the 3 B-factors with comparable estimates in prior work are: biased money
discounting and asset-side exponential growth bias in Goda et al. (2017), and ambiguity aversion in
Dimmock et al. (2016). See Section 3-B and the Data Appendix for more details.
10
   The only other paper we know of that estimates comparable conditional relationships between field
outcomes and multiple behavioral factors, in a broadly nationally representative sample, is Goda et al.
(2017), which does so for present-biased money discounting and exponential growth bias (i.e,. for 2 of
our 17 B-factors). But Goda et al. always include both B-factors in their regressions and hence does not
address the question of whether inferences change with single vs. multiple B-factors in the model. Bruine
de Bruin, Parker, and Fischoff (2007) and Li et al. (2015) also consider a relatively small set of behavioral
factors, in convenience samples, as do von Gaudecker et al. (2011) in a representative Dutch sample
without exploring links to field behavior. Gottlieb and Mitchell (2015) estimates the relationship between
holding long-term care insurance and narrow bracketing in a representative sample of older Americans,
and checks robustness to adding controls for loss aversion in tandem with adding many other variables.
Hwang (2016) estimates relationships between insurance holdings and loss aversion (and the interaction
between loss aversion and the Gambler’s Fallacy), in a nationally representative sample, but does not
control for cognitive skills and does not examine whether the loss aversion estimate is sensitive to the
inclusion of a Gambler’s Fallacy main effect. Tanaka et al. (2010) does lab-style elicitations for
estimating loss aversion, present-bias, and probability-weighting for 181 Vietnamese villagers, and links
those elicitations to survey data (on income, etc.), but considers each B-factor separately.

                                                                                                           5
factors. Our main takeaways here are strong empirical support for the hypothesis that behavioral
biases have distinct relationships with choices/outcomes, and pushback against criticism that
behavioral economics is overly siloed.

     On the fourth foundational question, various results suggest that our B-factor measures are
distinct from classical factors. Removing classical factors from our regressions does not
substantively affect point estimates on B-factors (this exercise also serves as a specification test a
la Altonji et al. (2005)). B-factors are poorly fit by even our full set of covariates, with adjusted
R-squareds below 0.10 in most cases, even after correcting for measurement error. We also
briefly examine correlations between B-factors and other covariates, and find that strong
correlations are the exception rather than the rule. 11 Our main takeaways here inform research
design: researchers may not actually need a rich set of control variables to identify conditional
correlations between field outcomes and behavioral biases. Conversely, measures of classical
factors are likely poor proxies for measures of B-factors.

     Overall, our results suggest that BE rests on empirical bedrock. B-factors are prevalent,
conditionally correlated with outcomes as predicted by theory, empirically distinct from each
other in ways that validate modeling one or few biases at a time, and largely distinct from other
decision inputs. Our use of response times to diagnose and correct for measurement error could
have broad applicability to survey and lab data. Our new direct elicitation methods open the door
to collecting much more data, at lower cost, for probing these questions and otherwise describing
behavioral biases, shaping models, and testing predictions. 12 Our findings on B-factor
separability open the door to collecting such data one factor at a time, for example by adding B-
factor elicitations, perhaps on a rotating basis, to large, established representative household
surveys that should offer more statistical power for testing links between outcomes and B-
factors. The trajectories of older literatures on consumer decision making inputs (e.g., on
11
   Among correlations between B-factors and other decision inputs, cognitive skills have been a particular
focus of prior work. Our findings are in line with this prior work: while we tend to find some negative
correlations between behavioral tendencies and fluid intelligence (Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro 2013;
Burks et al. 2009; Frederick 2005), those correlations are modestly-sized and do not hold across all B-
factors (Cesarini et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). See also Dohmen et al. (2010) on correlations between
measures of classical preferences/attitudes and intelligence. We lack measures of non-cognitive skills like
personality traits, but prior evidence finds weak if any correlations between those skills and B-factors (see
e.g., Becker et al.’s (2012) review article and subsequent papers citing it). Hence a priori there is little
concern that omitting non-cognitive skills will affect inferences about B-factors

research in BE.

1. Research design

In this section we describe our sample, survey design and elicitation methods, and empirical
strategies, including those for diagnosing and dealing with measurement error.

A. The American Life Panel

   Our data come from the RAND American Life Panel (ALP). The ALP is an online survey
panel that was established, in collaboration between RAND and the University of Michigan, to
study methodological issues of Internet interviewing. Since its inception in 2003, the ALP has
expanded to approximately 6,000 members aged 18 and older.
   The ALP takes great pains to obtain a nationally representative sample, combining standard
sampling techniques with offers of hardware and a broadband connection to potential
participants who lack adequate Internet access. ALP sampling weights match the distribution of
age, sex, ethnicity, and income to the Current Population Survey.

   Panel members are regularly offered opportunities to participate in surveys, the purposes of
which range from basic research to political polling. Over 400 surveys have been administered in
the ALP, and data become publicly available after a period of initial embargo. This opens up
opportunities for future work linking our data to other modules.

B. Our research design and sample

   Speaking broadly, our goal was to design elicitation methods that robustly yield data on the
widest possible range of behavioral factors at a reasonable cost. We chose a goal of keeping total
elicitation time to an hour. We also sought to use elicitation methods that could be employed
online rather than in-person, given that in-person elicitation typically comes at higher cost.

   In consultation with ALP staff, we divided our elicitations and other survey questions into
two thirty-minute modules. This strategy adhered to ALP standard practice of avoiding long
surveys (based on staff findings that shorter surveys improve both response rates and quality),
and allowed us to evenly disburse the more demanding tasks across the two modules. Per



                                                                                                 7
standard ALP practice, we paid panelists $10-$20 per completed module. We discuss task-based
incentives, and lack thereof, in Section 1-G.

   After extensive piloting, the ALP fielded the first part of our instrument as ALP module 315,
sending standard invitations to panel participants aged 18-60 in November 2014. Given our
target of 1,500 respondents, the ALP sent 2,103 initial invitations. The invitation remained open
until March 2015, but most respondents completed surveys during the first few weeks after the
initial invitation, as is typical in the ALP. 1,515 individuals responded to at least one of our
questions in module 315, and those 1,515 comprise the sample for our study and the sample
frame for part two of our instrument.

   The ALP fielded the second part of our instrument as ALP module 352, sending invitations
to everyone who responded to module 315, starting in January 2015 (to avoid the holidays), with
a minimum of two weeks in between surveys. We kept that invitation open until July 2015. 1,427
individuals responded in part or whole to that second module.

   Taken together, the two modules yielded a high retention rate (1427/1515 = 94%), low item
non-response rate, and high response quality (see below, and Data Appendix)—all features that
suggest promise for applying our methods in other contexts. We end up with usable data on a
large number of behavioral factors for nearly all 1,515 participants: the respondent-level mean
count of measurable behavioral factors is 14 out of a maximum of 16 (we measure two of our B-
factors using the same elicitation, and so the max here is 16 instead of 17), with a median of 15
and a standard deviation of 2.9.

   Module 352 also included an invitation to complete a short follow-up survey (module 354)
the next day. We use responses to the invitation and actual next-day behavior to measure limited
memory as described in the Data Appendix (Section L).

C. Measuring and describing behavioral factors: Elicitation methods and key antecedents

   We conduct elicitations of 17 potentially behavioral factors, 15 of which produce some
measure of the intensity of deviation, and six of which produce data sufficiently rich to permit
structural parameter estimation (such as an individual-level present- (or future-) biased
discounting parameter in a beta-delta model).Given our goals of directly eliciting useful
measures of B-factors without breaking the bank, we prioritize elicitation methods that have been

                                                                                               8
featured recently in top journals and were short and simple enough (or could be so modified) to
fit into modules that would also allocate substantial survey time to measuring other decision
inputs (Section 1-D) and outcome variables (Section 1-E).
     Table 1 summarizes our list of B-factors, elicitation methods and their key antecedents.
Details are in the Data Appendix. Deviations from classical norms may be uni-directional, as in
the case of choice inconsistency: someone either chooses consistently with the General Axiom of
Reveal Preference, or does not. For other B-factors, deviations from classical norms are bi-
directional. For example, in the case of discounting one can be either present-biased or future-
biased relative to being time-consistent (unbiased). For each bi-directional B-factor we define a
“standard” direction based on what has been more commonly observed or cited in prior work;
e.g., present-biased discounting (with future-bias classified as non-standard and time-consistent
as unbiased), over-confidence in performance (with under-confidence as non-standard and
accurate assessment of one’s own performance as unbiased), and underestimating exponential
growth (with over-estimating as non-standard and accurate estimation as unbiased). 13

     Table 2 shows that missing values from question-skipping/non-completion (“item non-
response”) or nonsense answers (“responded, not usable”) are uncommon: 11 of 17 B-factors we
have usable responses from more than 90% of the sample. Only two B-factors have usable data
for less than 80% of the sample—with one of those cases due in part to an inherent limitation of
the certainty premium elicitation rather than true item non-response. 14 Standard internal
consistency checks for respondent understanding and diligence produce results comparable to
prior work, as detailed in the Data Appendix.

13
   We use “B-factor” terminology in tandem with “behavioral bias” for two reasons. First, “factor” evokes
an input to decision making, and much of our analysis considers behavioral factors alongside other
factors. Second, as discussed above, many B-factors have two, mutually exclusive directional biases. The
Data Appendix provides further details, for each B-factor, on: i) motivation for trying to measure it; ii)
our elicitation method and its key antecedents; iii) data quality indicators, including item non-response;
iv) sample size (as it compares to that for other factors); v) definitions and prevalence estimates of
behavioral indicators, with background on the distinctions between standard vs. non-standard directional
biases where applicable, at different cutoffs for classifying a deviation from the classical norm as
behavioral; vi) descriptions of the magnitude and heterogeneity of behavioral deviations, including
descriptions of the distribution and—where the data permit—estimates of key parameters used in
behavioral models; and vii) estimates of conditional correlations with financial outcomes, including
particular components of our financial condition index that have particularly strong links to a given B-
factor per theory.
14
   Only those subjects who switch at some point on both multiple price lists identify a certainty premium
or discount. See the Data Appendix Section D for details.

                                                                                                        9
     Using our data to estimate B-factor prevalence, distributions, and structural model
parameters is straightforward, and we undertake those exercises in Sections 2, 3-A, and the Data
Appendix.

D. Measuring classical factors and survey effort

     Our modules also elicit rich measures of cognitive skills, demographics, patience, and risk
attitudes. We refer to these as “classical” factors because they are measures of human capital, life
cycle considerations and preference parameters that plausibly affect decisions and outcomes in
any model. These factors serve as control variables in regressions of outcomes on B-factors.
Measures of survey effort serve the same purpose, and also help correct for measurement error
(Sections 1-G and 3-C). Table 3 summarizes the classical factors and survey effort measures, and
this sub-section provides additional details.

     We measure aspects of cognitive skills using 4 standard tests. We assess general/fluid
intelligence with a standard, 15 question “number series” test (McArdle, Fisher, and Kadlec
2007) that is non-adaptive (i.e., everyone gets the same questions). The mean and median
number of correct responses in our sample is 11, with a standard deviation of 3. A second test is
comprised of 2 “numeracy” questions, 15 labeled as such and popularized in economics since their
deployment in the 2002 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. 16 Our mean number correct is
1.7, with a standard deviation of 0.6. A third test is a 3-question “financial literacy” quiz
developed and popularized by Lusardi and Mitchell (2014). 17 The median respondent gets all 3
correct, with a mean of 2 and a SD of 0.93. We also measure executive function—including
working memory and the regulation of attention—using a two-minute Stroop task (MacLeod




15
   “If 5 people split lottery winnings of two million dollars ($2,000,000) into 5 equal shares, how much
will each of them get?”; “If the chance of getting a disease is 10 percent, how many people out of 1,000
would be expected to get the disease?” Response options are open-ended.
16
   Banks and Oldfield (2007) interpret these as numeracy measures, and many other studies use them as
measures of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell 2014).
17
   “Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how
much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?”; “Imagine that the
interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how
much would you be able to buy with the money in this account?”; “Please tell me whether this statement
is true or false: "Buying a single company's stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual
fund." Response options are categorical for each of the three questions.

                                                                                                     10
1991). 18 Each time the subject chooses an answer that action completes what we refer to as a
“round.” 19 The task is self-paced in the sense that the computer only displays another round after
the subject completes a round by selecting a response. Subjects completed 71 rounds on average
(both mean and median) within the two minutes, with a standard deviation of 21. Mean (median)
number correct is 65 (68), with an SD of 24. Mean (median) proportion correct is 0.91 (0.99),
with an SD of 0.19.

     The four test scores—fluid intelligence, numeracy, financial literacy, and Stroop—have
pairwise correlations ranging from 0.19 to 0.45. Some (most) of our respondents had taken the
number series test (financial literacy quiz) in a prior module; we have confirmed robustness to
incorporating information from prior modules.

     We also elicit four standard measures of classical risk attitudes/preferences, although we end
up using only two of them in the empirics. The first comes from the adaptive lifetime income
gamble task developed by Barsky et al. (1997) and adopted by the Health and Retirement Study
and other surveys. 20 We use this to construct an integer scale from 1 (most risk tolerant) to 6
(most risk averse). The second is from Dohmen et al. (2010, 2011): “How do you see yourself:
Are you generally a person who is fully prepared to take financial risks” (100 point scale, we




18
  Our version displays the name of a color on the screen (red, blue, green, or yellow) and asks the subject
to click on the button corresponding to the color the word is printed in (red, blue, green, or yellow; not
necessarily corresponding to the color name). Answering correctly tends to require using conscious effort
to override the tendency (automatic response) to select the name rather than the color. The Stroop task is
sufficiently classic that the generic failure to overcome automated behavior (in the game “Simon Says,”
when an American crosses the street in England, etc.) is sometimes referred to as a “Stroop Mistake”
(Camerer 2007).
19
   Before starting the task the computer shows demonstrations of two rounds (movie-style)—one with a
correct response, and one with an incorrect response—and then gives the subject the opportunity to
practice two rounds on her own. After practice ends, the task lasts for two minutes.
20
   This task starts with: “…. Suppose that you are the only income earner in the family. Your doctor
recommends that you move because of allergies, and you have to choose between two possible jobs. The
first would guarantee your current total family income for life. The second is possibly better paying, but
the income is also less certain. There is a 50% chance the second job would double your current total
family income for life and a 50% chance that it would cut it by a third. Which job would you take—the
first job or the second job?” Those taking the risky job are then faced with a 50% probability that it cuts it
by one-half (and, if they still choose the risky job, by 75%). Those taking the safe job are then faced with
lower expected downsides to the risky job (50% chance of 20% decrease, and then, if they still choose the
safe job, a 50% chance of a 10% decrease).

                                                                                                           11
transform so that higher values indicate greater risk aversion). 21 Those first two scales are
correlated with each other (0.38) and we use them as covariates in our regressions. The third and
fourth measures are the switch points on the two multiple price lists we use to elicit the certainty
premium (Data Appendix Section D). Those latter two measures are correlated with each other
and with the first two, but we find empirically that they add no explanatory power to models
explaining either B-factors or financial outcomes. We have also used the first principal
component of the four risk aversion measures in our empirics, but find that the Dohmen et al.
and Barsky et al. measures included separately have more explanatory power.

     We measure patience using the average savings rate across the 24 choices in our version of
the Convex Time Budget task (Data Appendix Section A).

     The ALP tracks and record survey response time, screen-to-screen, and we use this to
construct measures of survey effort. Specifically, for each respondent we measure time spent on
each B-factor, on all B-factor elicitations, and on the entirety of the two modules.

     Our other source of control variables is the ALP’s standard set of demographic variables
(such as gender, age, income, education, household size, etc.), which are collected when a
panelist first registers, then refreshed quarterly and merged onto each new module.

E. Measuring financial choices and outcomes: A new index of financial condition

     Our instruments also elicit rich data on financial choices and outcomes. We construct nine
indicators of financial condition from 15 survey questions, 14 of which are in module 315. The
questions elicit information on net worth, financial assets, recent savings behavior, household
distress as measured by recent events (missed housing utility payments, forced moves, postponed
medical care, hunger), and summary self-assessments of savings adequacy, financial satisfaction
and financial stress. We drew the content and wording for these questions from other American
Life Panel modules and other surveys (including the National Longitudinal Surveys, the Survey
of Consumer Finances, the National Survey of American Families, the Survey of Forces, and the
World Values Survey). 1,508 of our 1,515 respondents provide data we can use to construct one



21
  We also elicit Dohmen et al.’s general risk-taking scale, which is correlated 0.68 with the financial
scale.

                                                                                                    12
or more of the nine indicators. The median respondent supplies the full nine, with a mean of 8.8
and standard deviation of 0.6.

   Table 4 shows the financial indicators, their sample proportions, and correlations between
them. In each case “1” indicates plausibly better financial condition. Our indicators include both
stocks and flows. They include five “hard” quantitative measures: positive net worth, positive
retirement assets, owning stocks, spending less than income in the last 12 months, and not
experiencing any of four specific objective indicators of severe financial distress in the last 12
months. They also include four “soft” subjective and self-assessed measures of financial
condition: financial satisfaction (1=above median), financial stress (1=below median), and
viewing retirement or non-retirement savings as “adequate” or better.

   As Table 4 shows, these nine indicators are positively correlated with each other, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that they are each signals of some underlying construct like
“financial health,” or “financial security,” although we use the more purely descriptive label of
“financial condition.” Our main outcome takes the individual-level mean of these nine indicator
variables. The sample mean of this summary measure is 0.43, meaning that the average
respondent exhibits 4 of our 9 indicators of better financial condition.

F. Regression specifications

   Our primary empirical exercise, beyond describing B-factor prevalence/distributions, is
estimating how cross-individual variation in B-factors correlates with financial condition. Our
main empirical specification does so by regressing (OLS), separately for each B-factor, financial
condition on the B-factor and a full set of controls:

    (1) 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵_𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵_𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵_𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

In these models i indexes individuals, and FinCond is the summary measure of financial
condition described in Section 1-E. The next two variables are B-factor indicators for standard
bias and non-standard bias (if applicable). The omitted category is unbiased/classical, unless
noted otherwise. We start with indicators because they provide a straightforward way to
summarize the data and check theoretical predictions re: standard vs. non-standard biases. We
also use measures that capture information on the magnitudes of behavioral deviations. One
approach standardizes the scale of deviations across B-factors, by calculating each individual’s

                                                                                                                                      13
percentile location (for both the standard and non-standard directional biases, where applicable)
in the distribution of each B-factor. X contains the full set of covariates for classical factors and
survey effort described above and in Table 3. In cases where responses for a particular variable
are missing we include a “missing” dummy for that observation and variable. In all we have over
100 control variables, many of them categorical, derived from up to 33 underlying measures.

G. Measurement error and other econometric concerns

     Classical measurement error in B-factors could bias their coefficients in regressions like
equation (1) above, and lead to underestimates of correlations between B-factors and classical
factors. More complicated measurement error structures, including non-classical and/or
correlated measurement error, could affect inferences about each of our foundational questions in
various ways. 22 Many features of our research design and data help us deal with measurement
error in B-factors and other variables. We summarize them here and flesh out many of them in
subsequent sections.

     Describing and stratifying on respondent task/survey effort helps diagnose and deal with
various measurement error concerns. B-factor prevalence does not vary with the amount of time
respondents spend on elicitation tasks (Section 2-B), obviating concerns that “trembles” or low
task engagement leads to upward bias in B-factor prevalence. Short response times are correlated
with non-response, so we control for non-response in the empirics. Our survey user interfaces do
not make “bad” financial condition an easier response than “good” financial condition (Appendix
Table 1), so low survey effort does not spuriously generate poor financial condition (Appendix
Table 2), or a spurious correlation between B-factors and financial condition.

     We use survey effort (response time) as a control in our empirics, nonetheless. In
specifications like equation (1) above, we include the respondent’s decile of time spent
responding to the elicitation for the included B-factor. We have also included deciles of total
time spent on all B-factor questions, and all questions overall, moving the control from B-factor
elicitation effort more narrowly to survey effort more broadly.


22
   Despite its potential importance, there has been surprisingly little work on diagnosing and correcting
for measurement error in direct elicitation data, as Gillen et al. (2017) discuss. See also, e.g., Beauchamp
et al. (forthcoming) and Dean and Ortoleva (2016). For a general reference see, e.g., Buonaccorsi (2010).

                                                                                                         14
   We also use survey effort measures to implement more direct measurement error corrections.
Respondents with shorter response times exhibit relatively weak correlations between B-factors
and other variables including outcomes (Appendix Table 3). In a series of corrections, we weight
observations in the regressions of equation (1) by survey time spent, specified various ways for
robustness. This weighting approach follows a measurement error literature about using auxiliary
data on observation “reliability,” where an observation’s reliability is inversely related to the
degree of regression error associated with that observation. Reliability-weighting is a preferred
approach when one is concerned about measurement error in many variables, not just the
variable(s) of interest, and is equivalent to correcting for a known form of heteroscedasticity
(Fuller 2009). We find that such corrections modestly strengthen the statistical relationships
between financial condition and B-factors, and improve the fit of the regressions overall.

   Several other features of the data offer further reassurances that our elicitations produce
useful information. Standard internal consistency checks for respondent understanding and
diligence produce results comparable to prior work (Data Appendix). Nor do we find unusually
high B-factor prevalence relative to prior work, in cases where prior work provides comparable
estimates (Section 2-A). These patterns further assuage the concern that our streamlined
elicitations spuriously identify B-factors. Our regression results linking B-factors to outcomes
provide “proof in the pudding” that our elicitations provide useful information.

   The data also reveal patterns predicted by theory that run counter to what one would expect if
our B-factors capture only noise or unmeasured aspects of classical factors. Purely noisy B-factor
measures should produce symmetric prevalence of standard and non-standard biases. Noisy B-
factors also should have weak or zero conditional correlations with outcomes. In contrast,
theories predict asymmetry: standard biases should be more prevalent, and more negatively
associated with outcomes, than non-standard biases. We generally do find these asymmetries in
the data (Sections 2-A and 3-A).

   Some readers may be concerned that 16 of our 17 B-factor elicitations are not incentivized on
the margin. We had ex-ante reasons for this design choice, as we faced an especially large
opportunity cost of incentivizing, in the sense that our research questions focus on multiple B-
factors and their links to outcomes. Paying task incentives would have meant measuring fewer
B-factors, on a smaller sample, thereby sacrificing breadth and likely statistical power.

                                                                                               15
Moreover, prior evidence suggests that paid vs. unpaid tasks do not necessarily change
inferences about behavioral factors in large representative samples; for recent evidence see, e.g.,
Von Gaudecker et al. (2011) and Gneezy et al. (2015). Unpaid tasks (with hypothetical rewards)
may even offer some conceptual advantages (Cohen et al. 2016), as may simpler/shorter tasks
(Chuang and Schechter 2015). Ex-post, it is reassuring that only 3% of respondents found our
modules uninteresting. 23 This finding pushes against the hypothesis that paying financial
incentives is important because subjects find direct elicitation tasks unpleasant.

     Beyond those measurement error concerns, we deal with two other unobserved heterogeneity
issues directly. One might wonder whether B-factors are distinct, as we treat them by initially
estimating equation (1) separately for each B-factor. We examine that directly in Section 4, by
asking how the results change if we include all B-factors simultaneously in a single model. To
preview the results, we find that the “all B-factors” model yields results almost identical to those
from the individual B-factor regressions.

     Another unobserved heterogeneity issue relates to whether B-factors reflect omitted
components of other classical factors, such as cognitive skills, classical preferences, education or
others. Section 5 present some specification tests along the lines of Altonji et al. (2005),
changing the set of covariates to see whether that significantly affects point estimates on the B-
factor coefficients. We also regress the B-factors themselves on all of our covariates, to estimate
how well-explained are B-factors by other observable characteristics. Both sets of results suggest
that our B-factor measures capture distinct influences rather than unobserved heterogeneity in
classical factors.

     Finally, in Section 3-D we consider how reverse causality would affect the interpretation of
equation (1). We view any reverse causality as interesting in its own right but unlikely to occur.

2. B-factors are prevalent

Here we address the first of our four foundational empirical questions, whether B-factors are
prevalent enough in a broad population to merit continued intensive study.


23
  Each ALP survey ends with “Could you tell us how interesting or uninteresting you found the questions
in this interview?” and roughly 90% of our sample replies “Very interesting” or “Interesting,” with only
3% replying “Uninteresting” or “Very uninteresting.”

                                                                                                     16
A. B-factors: Prevalence and comparisons to prior work

     Are B-factors prevalent in a broad population? As noted at the outset, our literature reviews
turned up U.S. population estimates for only 7 of the 17 B-factors we consider. The main
question here is qualitative: does the overall pattern of evidence suggest that behavioral
tendencies are more than just isolated anomalies?

     Table 2 shows that our B-factors are indeed prevalent. 24 Some deviation from classical norms
is indicated by at least 50% of the sample for 11 of the 16 factors for which we can estimate
prevalence. In the Data Appendix, we impose more-stringent thresholds on what indicates a
behavioral bias, counting only economically large deviations (defining “large” in various ways)
from classical norms, and find that most B-factors remain prevalent (e.g., exhibited by >20% of
the population).

     The “standard” directional bias emphasized by prior literature is indeed more prevalent in our
data, in 6 of the 7 B-factors where we capture bi-directional biases and there is a clear standard.25
This pattern is consistent with theory but inconsistent with measurement error stories. Purely
noisy B-factor measures should show symmetry between standard and non-standard biases. As
an example, if people are unable to perform exponential calculations in their heads, there is little
a priori reason to believe that random math mistakes would lie unequally in positive and negative
directions. But in fact, and consistent with prior work, we find that under-estimation of
compound growth or decline is far more common than over-estimation.

     Appendix Table 4 shows that our estimates of prevalence are in line with prior findings, for
the nine B-factors for which we could find prior studies on nationally representative samples.
Seven of these B-factors were estimated in prior work using comparable elicitations on U.S.
samples, and in five of these cases we find lower prevalence (time-inconsistent money
discounting, loss aversion, narrow bracketing, and both debt-side and asset-side exponential
growth biases). Our streamlined elicitations need not inflate prevalence estimates.



24
  Results are basically unchanged if we use the ALP’s population weights.
25
   Both Gambler’s Fallacies—hot-hand and cold-hand—have attracted substantial researcher attention,
and so for the purposes of estimating prevalence we do not think there is a clear standard directional bias.
For the purposes of estimating links to financial condition, we focus more on the hot-hand bias, for
reasons detailed in the Data Appendix.

                                                                                                         17
B. Does B-factor prevalence reflect low survey effort?

   The comparability of our B-factor prevalence with prior work notwithstanding, here we
discuss possible relationships between elicitation measurement error and our measured
prevalence. Do respondents rush through the survey with less care than one would hope, leading
us to classify economically harmless “trembles” as behavioral biases?

   As a threshold matter, if time spent responding to B-factor questions is a valid proxy for
survey effort, it should be the case that the quickest times, at least, are strongly correlated with
item non-response. Figure 1 and Appendix Table 5 confirm this relationship. Respondents in the
bottom decile of time spent responding to B-factor elicitations supply substantially fewer usable
B-factor responses, with an average proportion of missing B-factors of 0.29 compared to <0.10
in deciles 4 through 10.

   However, among the usable data on B-factors, there is no clear relationship between B-factor
prevalence and survey effort at the respondent level, as shown in Figure 2, which plots the
average (Number of behavioral biases indicated)/(Number of non-missing B-factors) for each
decile of survey effort. Appendix Table 6 breaks this out for each B-factor, and reveals that
different B-factors have different and often non-monotonic relationships between prevalence and
survey effort. Thus, among usable responses, quicker responses are not necessarily more likely to
be classified as behavioral.

   Putting the findings together, it seems that while non-response is a function of survey effort,
prevalence conditional on providing a response does not vary systematically with survey effort.
These findings are consistent with the abovementioned finding that 90% of respondents
characterize our modules as “interesting” or “very interesting.” Our elicitations seem to produce
attentive and thoughtful responses for all but a small number of very low effort respondents,
many of whom simply fail to supply data instead of (spuriously) responding in a way that we
would classify as behavioral.

   Our regressions will control for B-factor missing data, and control for or weight by survey
effort, to address measurement error concerns more formally.




                                                                                                 18
3. B-factors exhibit important links to field choices and outcomes

Here we address the second of our four foundational empirical questions, whether cross-sectional
heterogeneity in B-factors helps us understand field choices and outcomes. Theories of each B-
factor predict negative relationships between each (standard direction) behavioral bias and field
outcomes (see Data Appendix for details), yet these predictions have only been tested for 3 of
our 17 B-factors in representative U.S. data. We perform tests for each of the 17 B-factors, and
for B-factors and directional biases as a whole.

A. B-factor cross-sectional heterogeneity is substantial

   As a threshold matter, we start by noting the substantial heterogeneity in behavioral biases
across individuals. This is evident on both extensive and intensive margins. Our prevalence
estimates show the extensive margin heterogeneity: for most B-factors, many individuals exhibit
a bias, and many do not. The Data Appendix details the intensive margin heterogeneity, which
also tends to be substantial, and congruent with distributions estimated in prior work. Six of our
elicitations are rich enough to permit structural estimation of parameters from models used in
prior work, and we find very similar parameter estimates for the closest available comparisons:
time-inconsistent money discounting and GARP violations (Data Appendix Sections A and C).

B. B-factor cross-sectional heterogeneity is conditionally correlated with financial condition

   We now turn to our main test of whether B-factors are meaningfully linked to field choices
and outcomes: equation (1). As we detail in the Data Appendix, for each B-factor there is theory,
and in some cases prior empirical work, motivating the hypothesis that the (standard) behavioral
bias will induce sub-optimal choices and hence worse financial condition. Yet prior work on 14
of our 17 B-factors lacks even a single estimate of the relationship between a field outcome and a
B-factor, conditional on classical factors including cognitive skills, in representative U.S. data.
   Table 5 presents estimates of equation (1), regressing our rich measure of financial condition
on B-factor indicators and our full set of controls from Table 3, with one regression per B-factor
per column. We suppress coefficients on many of the 100+ control variables, focusing on
variables of interest. Reading within a column, any applicable standard bias vs. non-standard bias




                                                                                                      19
distinction is denoted in Table 1 and detailed in the Data Appendix. 26 The omitted B-factor
category is unbiased except for Certainty Premium and NBLLN, which each have the non-
standard bias as the omitted category because we lack unbiased responses.
     Table 5 supports the hypothesis that B-factors are negatively conditionally correlated with
financial condition, in ways predicted by behavioral theories. 6 (5) of the 17 standard bias
coefficients have p-values less than 0.10 (0.05). Tests across all 17 coefficients, or the 11
coefficients with p-values less than 0.10, estimate an average standard bias coefficient of -0.11 to
-0.28 depending on specification, with a p-value below 0.01 in 5 of 6 specifications (Table 6). In
contrast, the nonstandard bias coefficient has a p-value below 0.10 in only one of the six cases
where we can identify correlations on bi-directional biases, and that one case has a positive sign.
     16 of the 17 standard bias coefficients have the expected negative sign, and joint sign tests
confirm the hypothesis that the average coefficient is negative (Table 6). In contrast, we cannot
reject that the non-standard bias coefficients are centered on zero. Moreover, the standard
coefficient is more negative than the non-standard one in every case, although for the most part
the estimates are too imprecise to reject equality. To the extent one can infer asymmetry between
standard vs. non-standard biases, this pattern is consistent with theory and inconsistent with
plausible measurement error structures. Purely noisy B-factor measures should produce
symmetric (zero) conditional correlations between outcomes and standard vs. non-standard
biases. Likewise, B-factor measures that capture unmeasured aspects of classical factors should
produce symmetric (weakly negative) conditional correlations between outcomes and standard
vs. non-standard biases. 27
     Focusing on specific standard biases, the ones with p-values less than 0.10 are:
overconfidence in relative performance, limited attention, limited memory, present-biased money
discounting, underestimating exponential growth on future values, and ambiguity aversion. The
latter three are the only three among our 17 to have been considered in comparable prior work,

26
   Even though both Gambler’s Fallacies have generated substantial research, to the point where we are a
bit agnostic about which if either bias—hot hand vs. cold hand—should be considered standard, when
forced to choose for the purposes of organizing tables we label the hot hand standard, as this directional
bias has stronger conceptual links to arguably more harmful financial decisions (see the Data Appendix
for discussion).
27
   Looking at the control variables themselves in Table 5, being near retirement age, having greater
income and financial literacy, and financial risk aversion are all strongly conditionally correlated with
financial condition in the expected directions. The fact that other covariates exhibit weaker statistical
links in this specification may not mean much, given the possibility that we are over-controlling.

                                                                                                       20
with that work finding statistically significant negative correlations with financial outcomes in all
three cases (Dimmock et al. 2016; Goda et al. 2017).
     Magnitudes vary but one can easily interpret them since the RHS variables are indicators, the
LHS variable is scaled on [0, 1] and the mean of the LHS is 0.43. For example, in the first
column, present-biased money discounting is associated with a reduction in financial condition
of 0.038, about a 9% decline from the base. The other standard bias coefficients with p-values
below 0.10 imply associated reductions in financial condition ranging from 6% to 25%.
     On balance, we infer that behavioral biases are conditionally correlated with financial
condition, to economically and statistically significant extents. 28 Results in Sections 4 and 5
suggest that these correlations are not biased by unobserved correlations (in measurement error)
between a single B-factor and other B-factors, or between B-factors and (unmeasured aspects of)
other covariates. Before detailing those results, we show that a more direct approach to dealing
with measurement error sharpens inferences on B-factors, albeit modestly.

C. Using survey time/effort to correct for measurement error

     As outlined in Section 1-G, we correct for measurement error by weighting observations in
the regressions of equation (1) by survey effort, with effort specified various ways for
robustness. To motivate our approach, recall Appendix Table 3, which shows lower univariate
correlations between B-factors and other key variables (financial condition, education, cognitive
skills and income) in the first decile of survey effort relative to other deciles. Correlations are
higher in the 2nd-5th deciles, higher still in the 6th-9th deciles, and then decline in three of the four
cases in the highest decile (per discussions with ALP staff, we have learned that the highest
decile likely includes respondents who take a break from the survey without logging out). We
infer that measurement error affects the informativeness of some combination of B-factor
measures and other key variables. Recall that prevalence does not seem affected by survey effort
(Section 2-B). Putting the two results together, it seems that while “rushing” does not affect the
level of B-factor prevalence, it may affect the signal-to-noise ratio in various measurements.

     Table 6 shows how estimates of equation (1) change after weighting by different definitions
and functional forms of survey effort. Each cell reports the coefficient on the B-factor indicator

28
   We find similar results when replacing the indicators for standard and non-standard biases with their
linear percentiles (Appendix Table 7).

                                                                                                      21
in the row label (the standard bias indicator where applicable), from a single regression. Column
1 reproduces our result on each B-factor (standard bias where applicable) from Table 5 row 1.
Column 2 weights each observation by log(respondent’s time spent responding across all B-
factor elicitations). Results are quite similar to Column 2. Column 3 weights by decile of time
spent across all B-factor elicitations. Given extrema in both tails of time spent and the bit of
nonlinearity in Appendix Table 3, we view this as a more reasonable functional form
assumption. The coefficients tend to be a bit more negative, and the fit improves by two
percentage points. Column 4 weights by the decile of B-factor-specific survey time spent; e.g.,
when time-inconsistent money discounting is the B-factor we weight by the decile of time spent
reading instructions and responding to the money discounting elicitation. The results are similar
to those from the other specifications, with perhaps the only moderately noteworthy difference
being that two additional B-factors now have p-values below 0.10.

   The overall pattern is that down-weighting very rapid survey responses modestly improves
model fit, and also leads to modestly larger and more significant point estimates on the B-factors.
Other weighting specifications produce similar results. What we take from this is twofold. First,
measures of survey effort may be useful in diagnosing and correcting for the measurement error
that afflicts elicitation and testing across a broad range of fields (not just behavioral economics).
And second, our results are robust to these corrections, which (along with other results)
encourages us about the validity of our elicitations.

D. Reverse causality?
   We also consider whether B-factor correlations with financial condition reflect reverse
causality. Reverse causality would be a novel finding—it would indicate not just instability in
behavioral factors (within-subject over time), but a particular cause of instability that would
affect how theorists and empiricists model relationships between behavioral biases and decisions.
In any case, we surmise that reverse causality is unlikely to drive our inferences. Theoretically,
the sign of the bias introduced by any reverse causality is unclear; it could either understate or
overstate the importance of behavioral biases. Empirically, the case for reverse causality depends
on the existence of something that has not been found: substantial instability in B-factors, within-




                                                                                                  22
person. Prior work suggests that measured instability is largely due to measurement error and not
true changes in B-factors. 29

4. B-factors are distinct from each other re: relationships to choices and outcomes

     We now turn to our third foundational empirical question, whether B-factors have distinct
relationships with field choice and outcomes. The standard practice of behavioral economics is to
implicitly assume the answer to this question is “yes,” studying single or few B-factors in
isolation from the many others. There are of course conceptual and practical reasons for this
approach; focusing on the latter, theorists must simplify to generate tractable models, and
empiricists have lacked cost-effective tools for measuring multiple B-factors in representative
samples. But there are also reasons for questioning the validity of this practice (Fudenberg 2006).
There has been little if any empirical evidence brought to bear on this debate, as we discuss in
the Introduction, in part at least because of the lack of data linking multiple B-factors with field
choices and outcomes in representative samples.

     Our data is well-suited for a simple yet incisive test of B-factor separability. Our previous
section documents patterns of conditional correlations that are consistent with theoretical
predictions that single B-factors, in particular standard directional biases, have deleterious
influences on financial condition. We now test whether these inferences change if we jointly
consider our full set of behavioral biases rather than just one B-factor at a time.

     Table 7 presents results from two specifications of this test. The first two columns compare
the standard bias coefficients from equation (1) for each single B-factor (column 1 reproduces
the coefficients from the first row of Table 5) to the standard bias coefficients from estimating
equation (1) with the complete set of 25 behavioral bias indicators for all 17 B-factors (column


29
  Meier and Sprenger (2015) find moderate (in)stability in present-biased money discounting, over a two
year period. This instability is uncorrelated with observables (in levels or changes), which is consistent
with measurement error but not environmental factors (including those that could generate reverse
causality) playing an important role. Li et al. (2013) find moderate (in)stability in present-biased money
discounting and in loss aversion, over several months. Carvalho et al. (2016) find small changes in
present-biased money discounting around payday in a low-income sample, and no changes in choice
inconsistency (or in cognitive skills, contra, e.g., Shah et al. (2012) and Mani et al. (2013)). The strongest
evidence we know of for instability in a B-factor is the Callen et al. (2014) finding that exposure to
violent conflict increases preference for certainty. There is a larger body of evidence on the reliability of
non-behavioral measures of time and risk preferences; see, e.g., Meier and Sprenger (2015) and Chuang
and Schechter (2015) for recent reviews.

                                                                                                           23
2). The coefficients are similar for 16 of the 17 B-factors: for these 16 the biggest difference is a
single percentage point, and none of these differences have t-statistics>1. Columns 3 and 4
perform the same comparison, with the only specification difference being that we use our
preferred measurement error correction: weighting by the decile of respondent survey effort
across all B-factor elicitations. Again the coefficients are similar for 16 of the 17 B-factors, with
the largest difference among these now being 1.2 percentage points.

     These results also belie the concern that our B-factors are measured with too much error to be
informative, as the vector of “all other B-factors” contains several that have strong stand-alone
conditional correlations with outcomes in Table 5. If one interprets those stand-alone conditional
correlations as evidence of meaningful signal in measurement, then including them in the “all
other B-factors” vector should change inferences, if there is a true confounding correlation
amongst multiple B-factors and outcomes. We find no evidence of such a confound.

     All in all, Table 7 strongly supports B-factor separability assumptions, at least with respect to
financial condition, with profound implications for research practice and scope. On a practical
level, our results suggest that theorists and empiricists are on firm ground considering one or a
few B-factors in isolation from the many other potential behavioral influences. This validates
prior work and implies a relatively manageable set of technical and data requirements for making
continued progress going forward. On a more fundamental level, our results suggest that the
criticism of BE as studying separate B-factors in “silos” lacks empirical grounding. This stands
in apparent contrast to kindred lines of inquiry on cognitive skills and personality, where decades
of research and testing have distilled seemingly countless intelligences and traits to a few
underlying constructs. 30

5. B-factors are distinct from other decision inputs

Lastly, we consider our fourth foundational empirical question, whether B-factors are distinct
from other decision inputs. We explore aspects of this question that are focused on research
design, and on the underpinnings of behavioral biases themselves. Which other factors does one
need to control/account for to identify the relationships between B-factors and financial

30
  Stango, Yoong, and Zinman (2017) takes up the broader question of how the 17 B-factors are related to
each other, within-person, and what the relationships imply for models, applications, and research
directions. See also Dean and Ortoleva (2016).

                                                                                                    24
condition documented above? And how much of the information in our B-factor measures is
explained by classical factors (instead of behavioral influences per se), including those like
demographics that tend to be more readily available from a data perspective?

   In addressing the distinctness question we focus on our covariates overall, or on groups of
them. We do not interpret specific correlations between B-factor measures and other covariates,
because the many correlations among the other covariates complicate that analysis and demand
more thorough consideration than we have space for here. We leave this for future work, and for
now provide some preliminary estimates of univariate and conditional correlations between
behavioral biases and other covariates, for reference (Appendix Tables 3 and 8).

A. Do estimates of links between financial condition and B-factors change based on the
omission/inclusion of other covariates?

   One way to explore whether our B-factor measures capture distinct inputs to consumer
decision making is to examine sensitivity to omitting other sets of covariates, following Altonji
et al. (2005). If, the reasoning goes, our B-factor coefficients reflect omitted components of those
covariates instead of behavioral influences per se, then dropping the observed components of
those covariates should substantively change the B-factor coefficient estimates.

   Table 8 show results from these exercises. The first column shows the standard-bias B-factor
coefficients from Table 5 row 1. The second column drops our measures of cognitive skills from
the specification in column 1. Comparing column 1 to column 2, none of the 17 B-factor
coefficients are different with p-values below 0.10. Moreover the magnitude of any change in the
point estimates is uniformly small, and in mixed directions. The third column drops our measures
of classical preferences (risk and patience) from the specification in column 1. Again the B-
factor coefficient estimates do not change. The fourth column drops age, education, and gender
from the specification in column 1. Again the B-factor coefficient estimates do not change. The
fifth drops our measures of survey effort from the specification in column 1. Again the B-factor
coefficient estimates do not change. Across the 68 comparisons implicit in this table, none of
them indicate statistically significant differences; in fact, the largest difference is only 1.1
percentage points, with a p-value of 0.69.




                                                                                                 25
   Overall there is little if any evidence here that our B-factor measures are simply proxies for
other covariates. This suggests that the data requirements for estimating relationships between B-
factors and field choices/outcomes need not be onerous, at least with respect to financial
condition: one need not be overly concerned that omitting cognitive skills, classical preferences,
some standard demographics, or even survey effort would substantively bias an estimated
relationship between a B-factor and financial outcomes.

B. Do other covariates explain B-factors in the cross section?

   Another way to explore whether our B-factor measures capture distinct inputs to consumer
decision making is to estimate how much of their variance is explained by other covariates. To
do this we simply take our main specification in (1) and move a measure of the (standard
directional) behavioral bias to the left-hand-side:

                                  (2) 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝑐𝑐𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

   Table 9 reports four estimates of the adjusted R-squared for each B-factor. Columns 1 and 2
use standard bias indicators, without and with our preferred measurement error correction
(weighting by the decile of time spent responding across all B-factor elicitations). Columns 3 and
4 use standard bias percentiles, again without and with the measurement error correction. Of
these 68 estimates of fit, only 14 exceed 0.1, and 32 are less than 0.05. Weighting does tend to
improve fit, but only modestly (by a percentage point or two in most cases). In short, our
measures of behavioral biases are almost entirely unexplained by other covariates.

   Several other results suggest that the lack of fit is not simply attributable to measurement
error. Conceptually, including all of the other covariates is a powerful test, in the sense that even
if one worries that a given measure fails to capture something important about that classical
factor (e.g., a particular test score does not completely capture cognitive skills), one or more of
the many other related measures (education, income, etc.) is likely to pick it up. Practically, both
the B-factors together and the other covariates fit our other key variable, financial condition,
relatively well. The fit of those models is over 0.40, with B-factors separately fitting 0.16 of
variation across individuals and all other covariates as a group fitting 0.34. And various other
findings above re: our behavioral bias measures suggest that they capture abundant signal (see
Section 1-G for a summary).

                                                                                                  26
6. Conclusion

     Despite broad and growing influence, behavioral economics has lacked nationally
representative evidence on basic empirical questions, and we provide methods and data for
addressing four of them. Behavioral biases are prevalent, not anomalous. They are correlated
with field choices and outcomes in ways predicted by theory, not neutralized by market forces,
learning, or high stakes. They are separable in practice, not artificially siloed for modeling
convenience. And they are distinct features of consumer decision making, not merely proxies for
unmeasured aspects of classical inputs to decision making like cognitive skills, classical
preferences, or life-cycle variables. No fewer than a dozen features of our research design, data,
and results push against the hypothesis that measurement error drives our inferences.

     This paper only begins to tap the potential of the new elicitation methods and dataset
described herein. On the elicitation side, direct comparisons between our elicitations and
standard ones would refine approaches to lowering the cost of measuring B-factors. Our methods
are suitable for collecting data in a variety of settings and thus can be used to expand the
evidence base on B-factors. In particular, our findings on the separability of behavioral biases
imply that our streamlined elicitations could be integrated into established representative and
large-sample household surveys, one B-factor at a time. This would increase power for
estimating relationships between behavioral biases and field choices/outcomes. For the time
being, we have another round of data collection from our sample underway that will add to the
small body of evidence on the reliability (intertemporal stability) of directly elicited behavioral
factors. 31 This is key to unpacking the direction and extent of any causality underlying
conditional correlations between behavioral factors and outcomes.

     In terms of the data used here, we are already at work exploring relationships among B-
factors, and how to efficiently measure and summarize information on behavioral and other
decision inputs. Beyond there are many possibilities for exploiting the panel, multi-topic
architecture of the ALP to explore relationships between our behavioral variables, covariates,
and outcomes in yet more domains. That work could include more detailed consideration of
behavioral theories, including structural models, than we undertake in this paper.

31
   Chuang and Schechter (2015) speculate that simpler elicitations may produce better reliability by
reducing noise.

                                                                                                 27
   Pushing further to map links between the multitude of behavioral factors and outcomes will
improve understanding about consumer choice, market functioning, and policy design across the
many domains in which behavioral economics has taken hold—energy, household finance, labor,
health and others.

Unit of observation is the individual respondent, and missing shares are relative to the full sample size of 1,515. Section 1-C provides some
details on measuring individual behavioral factors and classifying directional biases as standard vs. non-standard; see the Data Appendix for
additional details. "GARP" = General Axiom of Revealed Preference. "CCEI" = Critical Cost Efficiency Index. Proportion exhibiting relative
overconfidence is 50% by construction, since our elicitation does not produce a clear cardinal measure (as detailed in Data Appendix Section
H). "Share biased" is conditional on non-missing values. "Survey nonresponse" indicates panelists who took our first module but not our
second. "Item nonresponse" can occur on either module. The large "unusable" share for the Certainty Premium is partly due to respondents
who do not switch on the multiple price lists; this is a limitation of the elicitation rather than an indicaiton of low-quality responses (Data
Appendix Section D). The large unusable share for EGB loan-side is due largely to responses that imply a zero APR (Data Appendix Section
L).

Variable definitions: net worth is from two summary questions: "Please think about all of your household assets (including but not limited to investments,
other accounts, any house/property you own, cars, etc.) and all of your household debts (including but not limited to mortgages, car loans, student loans, what
you currently owe on credit cards, etc.) Are your household assets worth more than your household debts?" and "You stated that your household's
[debts/assets] are worth more than your household's [assets/debts]. By how much?" Retirement assets is from questions on IRAs and workplace plans.
Stockholding is from questions on stock mutual funds in IRAs, stock mutual funds in 401ks/other retirement accounts, and direct holdings. Spent < income is
from a summary question on spending vs. saving over the past year, taken from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Financial satisfaction is based on a 100-
point scale responding to "How satisfied are you with your household's overall economic situation?" Savings adequacy questions are placed one each in the
two different modules to mitigate mechanical correlations, with response options framed to encourage people to recognize tradeoffs between saving and
consumption. Indicators of severe financial distress are taken from the National Survey of American Families: late/missed payment rent, mortgage, heat, or
electric; moved in with other people because could not afford housing/utilities; postponed medical care due to financial difficulty; adults in household cut
back on food due to lack of money. Financial stress is based on an 100 point scale in response to: "To what extent, if any, are finances a source of stress in
your life?"

* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01. Unit of observation is an individual respondent. One regression per column. LHS variable is the summary measure of financial condition: the proportion of indicators with a "1" from Table 3. Models are OLS and also include covariates described
in Table 3 but not shown here to save space: four race/ethnicity categories, immigrant indicator, 3 marital status categories, 4 household size categories, 5 work status categories, state of residence dummies, and dummies for missing values associated with each variable
and for not taking our 2nd module. Omitted category for B-factors is unbiased (classical), except for Certainty Premium and Nonbelief in the Law of Large Numbers (NBLLN), where nonstandard bias is the omitted category due to lack of unbiased responses. See
Section 1-C and the Data Appendix for details on B-factor variable construction.

to those in Table 5, except for weighting in columns 2-4 (weighted models exclude survey effort deciles as controls). For B-factors with bi-directional
biases we report only the standard bias indicator. The first column is identical to top row of Table 5. Regressions in the second column weight
observations by the natural log of total time spent on all B-factor questions. Third column weights by decile of total time spent on all B-factor
questions. Last column weights by the time spent on questions used to measure only the B-factor included in a given regression. Sign tests are against
the null that the coefficient values are centered on zero. Average effects and standard errors are estimated by stacking the regressions and accounting
for covariance across models. "Excluding stand-alone" group is, in each column, the set of coefficients with p>0.10. Average effects cannot be
estimated across models in column (4) because each row employs a different weighting scheme.

and the weighting in columns 3 and 4 (and when we weight we do not also include survey effort deciles as controls). For B-factors with bi-
directional biases we report only the standard bias indicator: note that the first column is identical to top row of Table 5. Regression(s) in the
second column are identical to those in the first but include all B-factor indicators at once, rather than estimating each in a separate regression.
Regressions in the third column weight by total time spent responding to all B-factor elicitations (same as Table 6, column 3). Fourth column
is identical to third but includes all B-factors in the model at once. No coefficients are different across the two models with p<0.10.

responding to B-factor elicitations. RHS variables are the full set of covariates described in Table 3, with two
exceptions. The model for "over-confidence in level performance" excludes numeracy, which has a
mechanical relationship to the B-factor because it forms the basis for over-confidence in number of answers
correct. Also, the model for over-confidence in relative performance excludes fluid intelligence, for the same
reason.

Notes: B-factors are summarized as the fraction of 17 B-factor indicators displayed at the respondent
level. So each cell presents an estimate of a univariate correlation between that B-factor summary
measure and the linearized variable described in the row label. Cognitive skill is a continuous principal
component score derived from the four cognitive skill variables described in Table 3. Education
categories are defined in Table 3 and coded on a 1-4 scale.

prevalence estimate from a representative sample. See Data Appendix for details on elicitations, prevalence
and distributions. In some cases we take comparisons directly from prior work, and in others we use data from
other papers to perform our own calculations. "GARP" = General Axiom of Revealed Preference. "APR" =
Annual Percentage Rate. "FV" = Future Value.

* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01. Unit of observation is the individual, with one OLS regression per column. LHS variable is the 0/1 B-factor indicator (for the standard directional bias where applicable) shown in the column header. GARP=General Axiom of Revealed Preference.
NBLLN=Non-belief in the Law of Large Numbers. EGB=Exponential Growth Bias. All regressions here include the full set of controls described in Table 3, with two exceptions. The model for "over-confidence in level performance" excludes numeracy, which has a
mechanical relationship to the B-factor because it forms the basis for over-confidence in number of answers correct. Also, the model for over-confidence in relative performance excludes fluid intelligence, for the same reason. Not shown are four race/ethnicity categories,
state of residence, immigrant indicator, 3 marital status categories, 4 household size categories, and 5 work status categories. Sample size varies because missing B-factor observations are discarded. Patience is the average savings rate across the 24 CTB decisions; we also
include a dummy for missing this variable. See Section 1-C and the Data Appendix for details on B-factor variable construction.
                                         Data Appendix

This Appendix details, for each of the 17 individual behavioral factors (B-factors):

   i)      The motive for eliciting that B-factor and the mechanism through which that factor
           might affect financial condition;
   ii)     our elicitation method and its key antecedents;
   iii)    data quality indicators, including item non-response;
   iv)     sample size (as it compares to that for other B-factors);
   v)      definitions and prevalence estimates of behavioral indicators, with background on the
           distinctions between standard vs. non-standard directional biases where applicable;
   vi)     descriptions of the magnitude and heterogeneity of behavioral deviations, including
           descriptions of the distribution and—where the data permit—estimates of key
           parameters used in behavioral models;
   vii)    estimates of conditional correlations between measures of the behavioral factor and
           financial outcomes, including particular components of our financial condition index
           (itself described in Section 1-E of the paper) that have particularly strong links to the
           B-factor per theory. Wherever possible we also provide comparisons to prior work.


A. Present- or Future-Biased Discounting (Money)
   Time-inconsistent discounting has been linked, both theoretically and empirically, to low
levels of saving and high levels of borrowing (e.g., Laibson 1997; Meier and Sprenger 2010;
Toubia et al. 2013).
   We measure discounting biases with respect to money using the Convex Time Budgets
(CTB) method created by Andreoni and Sprenger (2012). In our version, fielded in ALP module
315 (the first of our two surveys), subjects make 24 decisions, allocating 100 hypothetical tokens
each between (weakly) smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts. See Data Appendix Figure 1 for
an example. The 24 decisions are spread across 4 different screens with 6 decisions each. Each
screen varies start date (today or 5 weeks from today) x delay length (5 weeks or 9 weeks); each
decision within a screen offers a different yield on saving. Among the 1,515 individuals who
take our first survey, 1,502 subjects make at least one CTB choice, and the 1,422 who complete
at least the first and last decisions on each of the 4 screens comprise our CTB sample.
    The CTB already has been implemented successfully in field contexts in the U.S. (Barcellos
and Carvalho 2014; Carvalho, Meier, and Wang 2016) and elsewhere (Gine et al. forthcoming).
In exploring data quality and prevalence below we focus on comparisons to Andreoni and
Sprenger (2012), and Barcellos and Carvalho (2014). 1 AS draw their sample from university
students. BC’s sample is drawn from the ALP, like ours (module 212 in their case), but they use
a different adaptation of the CTB.
    Indicators of response quality are encouraging for the most part. Interior allocations are more
common in our sample than in AS, and comparable to BC. More of our subjects exhibit some
variance in their allocations than AS or BC. Our subjects are internally consistent on the whole—
e.g., exhibiting strong correlations in choices across different screens and delay dates—but 41%
do exhibit some upward-sloping demand among 20 pairs of decisions, a figure that is within the
range commonly found in discount rate elicitations but high compared to the 8% in AS. 2
    We calculate biased discounting, for each individual, by subtracting the consumption rate
when the sooner payment date is five weeks from today from the consumption rate when the
sooner payment date is today, for each of the two delay lengths. We then average the two
differences to get a continuous measure of biased discounting. In keeping with AS, BC and
several other recent papers (including Carvalho, Meier, and Wang (2016) and Goda et al.
(2017)), we find little if any present-bias on average, with a median discount bias of zero, and a
1pp mean tilt toward future bias. 3

    Indicators of behavioral deviations here are bi-directional: we label someone as present-
biased (future-biased) if the average difference is >0 (<0). We deem present-bias the “standard”
direction, since future-bias is relatively poorly understood 4 and could actually lead to more
wealth accumulation. Counting any deviation from time-consistent discounting as biased, 26% of
our sample is present-biased and 36% is future-biased. These prevalence estimates fall

1
  Carvalho, Meier, and Wang use the American Life Panel like we and Barcello and Carvalho, but on a
lower-income sample (ALP module 126).
2
  High rates of non-monotonic demand are not uncommon in discount rate elicitation: Andreoni and
Sprenger (2012) report rates ranging from 10 to 50 percent in their literature review. In Barcellos and
Carvalho 26% of subjects exhibit some upward-sloping demand, among only 4 pairs of decisions. In our
sample non-monotonic demand is strongly correlated within-subject across the four screens, and
decreases slightly by the final screen, suggesting that responses are picking up something systematic.
3
  Bradford et al. (2014) do find present-bias on average in their Qualtrics sample, classifying >50% as
present-biased and 26% as future-biased.
4
  Although see Koszegi and Szeidl (2013) for a theory of future-biased discounting.
substantially if we set a higher threshold for classifying someone as behavioral; e.g., if we count
only deviations > |20|pp, then only 3% of the sample is present-biased and 5% future-biased.
Compared to prior prevalence estimates, our zero-threshold ones are in the middle of the range.
E.g., BC’s CTB elicitation in the ALP shows 29% with any present-bias, and 37% with any
future-bias. Goda et al. use a different elicitation method—a “time-staircase” multiple price list
(Falk et al. 2015)—and classify 55% of their nationally representative sample (from the ALP and
another online panel) as present-biased. In the AS sample 14% exhibit any present-bias and 12%
any future-bias.

    Interestingly, if we follow AS and use the CTB data to structurally estimate discounting-bias
parameter values for each individual, we find that 90% of our subjects with no monotonicity
violations lie within the interval [0.93, 1.07] (Data Appendix Table 1, Columns 11-13). 5 This is
noteworthy because behavioral macro papers sometimes assume representative agents with
present bias that lies strictly below our 5th percentile (see, e.g., (İmrohoroğlu, İmrohoroğlu, and
Joines 2003; Graham and Snower 2013; Pérez Kakabadse and Palacios Huerta 2013). As Harris
and Laibson (2013) state: “the short-run discount factor… is typically thought to lie between ½
and 1.” Our estimates should give researchers pause before choosing a value much below 1.
    Our estimates of conditional correlations between financial condition and discounting biases
(Tables 5-8 and Appendix Table 7) differ in several respects from previous studies that estimate
relationships between directly elicited discounting biases and outcomes in broad samples
(Bradford et al. 2014; Eisenhauer and Ventura 2006; Goda et al. 2017). 6 We use CTBs rather
than Multiple Price Lists, test more flexible functional forms, and control for a much richer set of
(behavioral) factors that could be correlated with both discounting and outcomes. 7
    Our findings suggest that future bias is uncorrelated with financial condition, that present
bias is, and that the present bias correlation is robust to different functional forms and to
excluding various key control variables—including other B-factors. The magnitude of the
correlation is substantial, implying e.g., that present-biased individuals have financial condition


5
  The 5th to 95th percentile interval AS’ sample is [0.91, 1.11], as reported in their Table 3.
6
  Other papers have explored links between discounting biases and field behavior using direct elicitations
on narrower samples, with narrower sets of covariates; see e.g., Chabris et al. (2008), Meier and Sprenger
(2010), Burks et al. (2012), and Li et al. (2015).
7
  Other key differences include Bradford et al. (2014) lacking controls for cognitive skills, and Eisenhauer
and Ventura (2006) only controlling for income.
that is 10% worse than unbiased (i.e., time-consistent) individuals, conditional on our rich set of
controls.
B. Present- or Future-Biased Discounting (Food)

    In light of evidence that discounting can differ within-subject across domains (e.g.,
Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015), we also obtain a coarse measure of discounting
biases for consumption per se, by asking two questions that follow Read and van Leeuwen
(1998) : “Now imagine that you are given the choice of receiving one of two snacks for free,
[right now/five weeks from now]. One snack is more delicious but less healthy, while the other is
healthier but less delicious. Which would you rather have [right now/five weeks from now]: a
delicious snack that is not good for your health, or a snack that is less delicious but good for
your health? We fielded these questions in ALP module 352, the second of our two surveys.

    Of the 1427 persons taking our second survey, 1423 answer one of the two snack questions,
and 1404 respond to both. 61% choose the healthy snack for today, while 68% choose it for five
weeks in the future, with 15% exhibiting present bias (consume treat today, plan to eat healthy in
the future) and 7% future bias (consume healthy today, plan to eat treat in the future). 8 Barcellos
and Carvalho’s ALP subjects answered similar questions in their baseline survey, albeit with
only a one-week instead of a five-week delay, with 6% exhibiting present-bias and 9% future-
bias. Read and van Leeuwen (1998) offer actual snacks to a convenience sample of employees in
Amsterdam but do not calculate individual-level measures of bias. They do find substantial
present-bias on average.

    Tables 5-8 and Appendix Table 7 present the first estimates we know of correlating measures
of consumption discounting biases with field outcomes. We do not find any evidence of
statistically significant coefficients. Having said that the present-biased coefficient has the
expected negative sign across all specifications. Among the components of our financial
condition index, present-bias has been particularly strongly linked to a low savings rate, and
indeed in unreported results we find the same relationship between present-bias and savings (one
component of our financial condition index).


8
  If we limit the sample to those who did not receive the informational/debiasing treatment about self-
control in ALP module 212 (Barcellos and Carvalho), we find 15% with present bias and 8% with future
bias (N=748).
C. Inconsistency with General Axiom of Revealed Preference (and dominance avoidance)

    Our third and fourth behavioral factors follow Choi et al. (2014), which measures choice
inconsistency with standard economic rationality. Choice inconsistency could indicate a
tendency to make poor (costly) decisions in field contexts; indeed, Choi et al. (2014) find that
more choice inconsistency is conditionally correlated with less wealth in a representative sample
of Dutch households.

    We use the same task and user interface as in Choi et al. (2014) but abbreviate it from 25
decisions to 11. 9 Each decision confronts respondents with a linear budget constraint under risk:
subjects choose a point on the line, and then the computer randomly chooses whether to pay the
point value of the x-axis or the y-axis. 1,270 of the 1,427 individuals taking our second survey
make all 11 decisions, and comprise our sample for measuring choice inconsistency. 10 See Data
Appendix Figure 2 for an example.

    Following Choi et al., we average across these 11 decisions, within-consumer, to benchmark
choices against two different standards of rationality. One benchmark is a complete and
transitive preference ordering adhering to the General Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP),
as captured by the Afriat (1972) Critical Cost Efficiency Index. 1-CCEI can be interpreted as the
subject’s degree of choice inconsistency: the percentage points of potential earnings “wasted”
per the GARP standard. But as Choi et al. discuss, consistency with GARP is not necessarily the
most appealing measure of decision quality because it allows for violations of monotonicity with
respect to first-order stochastic dominance (FOSD). 11 Hence, again following Choi et al., our




9
  We were quite constrained on survey time and hence conducted a pilot in which we tested the feasibility
of capturing roughly equivalent information with fewer rounds. 58 pilot-testers completed 25 rounds, and
we estimated the correlation between measures of choice inconsistency calculated using the full 25
rounds, and just the first 11 rounds. These correlations are 0.62 and 0.88 for the two key measures.
10
   1424 individuals view at least one of the instruction screens, 1,311 are recorded as completing at least
one round of the task, and 1,270 are recorded as completing each of the 11 rounds.
11
   E.g., someone who always allocates all tokens to account X is consistent with GARP if they are
maximizing the utility function U(X, Y)= X. Someone with a more normatively appealing utility
function—that generates utility over tokens or consumption per se—would be better off with the decision
rule of always allocating all tokens to the cheaper account.
second measure captures inconsistency with both GARP and FOSD. 12 Note that these measures
of inconsistency are unidirectional: there is no such thing as being overly consistent.

     Our distribution of individual-level CCEI estimates is nearly identical to Choi et al.’s— if we
use only the first 11 rounds of choices from Choi et al. to maximize comparability to our setup.
Our median (1-CCEI) is 0.002, suggesting nearly complete consistency with GARP. The mean is
0.05. The median (1-combined-CCEI), capturing FOSD violations as well, is 0.10, with a mean
of 0.16. Choice inconsistency is substantially higher when using the full 25 rounds in both our
pilot data and Choi et al. (e.g., mean CCEI of 0.12 in both samples), and we have verified that
this is a mechanical effect (more rounds means more opportunities to exhibit inconsistency)
rather than deterioration in consistency as rounds increase, by finding that CCEIs measured over
small blocks of consecutive rounds remain constant as the average round number of those blocks
increases.

     In terms of prevalence in our data, 53% of subjects exhibit any inconsistency with GARP,
and 96% exhibit any inconsistency with GARP or FOSD. If we set a 20pp threshold for
classifying someone as inconsistent, only 7% are inconsistent with GARP, and 31% are
inconsistent with GARP or FOSD. Looking more directly at heterogeneity, we see standard
deviations of 0.08 and 0.18, and 10th-90th percentile ranges of 0.16 and 0.41.

     Choi et al. find that choice inconsistency with GARP is conditionally correlated with lower
net worth, but that choice inconsistency with GARP+dominance avoidance is not. Our data show
little evidence of a significant conditional correlation between either measure of choice
inconsistency and our broader measure of financial condition, although the coefficients have the
expected negative sign (Tables 5-8 and Appendix Table 7).

D. Risk attitude re: certainty (Certainty Premium)

     Behavioral researchers have long noted a seemingly disproportionate preference for certainty
(PFC) among some consumers and posited various theories to explain it: Cumulative Prospect
Theory (Daniel Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992),
Disappointment Aversion (Bell 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1986; Gul 1991), and u-v preferences

12
   The second measure calculates 1-CCEI across the subject’s 11 actual decisions and “the mirror image
of these data obtained by reversing the prices and the associated allocation for each observation” (Choi et
al. p. 1528), for 22 data points per respondent in total.
(Neilson 1992; Schmidt 1998; Diecidue, Schmidt, and Wakker 2004). PFC may help to explain
seemingly extreme risk averse behavior, which could in turn lead to lower wealth in the cross-
section.

     We use Callen et al.’s (2014) two-task method 13 for measuring a subject’s certainty premium
(CP). 14 Similar to Holt and Laury tasks, in one of the Callen et al. tasks subjects make 10 choices
between two lotteries, one a (p, 1-p) gamble over X and Y > X , (p; X, Y), the other a (q, 1-q)
gamble over Y and 0, (q; Y, 0). Both Callen et al. and we fix Y and X at 450 and 150
(hypothetical dollars in our case, hypothetical Afghanis in theirs), fix p at 0.5, and have q range
from 0.1 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1. In the other task, p = 1, so the subject chooses between a
lottery and a certain option. Our two tasks are identical to Callen et al.’s except for the currency
units. But our settings, implementation, and use of the elicited data are different. Callen et al.
administer the tasks in-person, using trained surveyors, at polling centers and homes in
Afghanistan. They use the data to examine the effects of violence on risk preferences.

     1,463 of 1,505 (97%) of our subjects who started the tasks completed all 20 choices
(compared to 977/1127 = 87% in Callen et al.). As is typical with Holt-Laury tasks, we exclude
some subjects whose choices indicate miscomprehension of or inattention to the task. 11% of our
subjects multiple-switch on our two-lottery task (compared to 10% in Callen et al.), and 9% of
our subjects multiple-switch on the lottery vs. certain option tasks (compared to 13% in Callen et
al.). 14% of our subjects switch too soon for monotonic utility in the two-lottery—in rows [2, 4]
in the two-lottery task—compared to 13% in Callen et al. All told, 19% of our subjects exhibit a
puzzling switch (17% in Callen et al.), leaving us with 1,188 usable observations. Of these
subjects, 1,049 switch on both tasks, as is required to estimate CP. Of these 1,049, only 30%
switch at the same point on both tasks, in contrast to 63% in Callen et al.

     We estimate CP for each respondent i by imputing the likelihoods q* at which i expresses
indifference as the midpoint of the q interval at which i switches, and then using the two
likelihoods to estimate the indirect utility components of the CP formula. As Callen et al. detail,
the CP “is defined in probability units of the high outcome, Y, such that one can refer to certainty

13
   Callen et al. describes its task as “a field-ready, two-question modification of the uncertainty equivalent
presented in Andreoni and Sprenger (2016).”
14
   The Callen et al. tasks also elicit non-parametric measures of classical risk aversion: a higher switch
point indicates greater risk aversion. We discuss these measures in Section 1-D of the paper.
of X being worth a specific percent chance of Y relative to its uncertain value.” We estimate a
mean CP of 0.16 in our sample (SD=0.24, median =0.15), compared to 0.37 (SD=0.15) in Callen
et al. Callen et al.’s findings suggest that much of the difference could be explained by greater
exposure to violence in their sample.

     As Callen et al. detail, the sign of CP also carries broader information about preferences. CP
= 0 indicates an expected utility maximizer. CP>0 indicates a preference for certainty (PFC), as
in models of disappointment aversion or u-v preferences. We classify 77% of our sample as PFC
type based on an any-deviation threshold. This falls to 73%, 60%, or 42% if we count only larger
deviations >0 (5pp, 10pp, or 20pp) as behavioral. In Callen et al. 99.63% of the sample exhibits
PFC. CP<0 indicates a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) type, and we classify 23%, 20%, 13%
or 7% as CPT under the different deviation thresholds. We denote PFC as the standard bias,
simply because CP>0 is far more common than CP<0 in both our data and Callen et al.’s.

     Callen et al. find significant correlations between the CP and financial outcomes, in
particular with avoiding late loan repayments, 15 but their data lack controls for cognitive skills
and other B-factors. We do not find evidence of a statistically significant correlation between CP
and our index of financial outcomes, and the implied magnitude of our point estimates is small,
although our index lacks a direct measure of loan delinquency. Looking particularly at the
component of our financial condition index most directly linked to risk-taking—holding public
equities—we do find stronger correlations, with point estimates of -0.03 for our CP indicator and
-0.05 for our CP percentile and p-values of about 1 in each case.

E. Loss aversion/small-stakes risk aversion

     Loss aversion refers to placing higher weight on losses than gains, in utility terms. It is one of
the most influential concepts in the behavioral social sciences, with seminal papers—e.g.,
Tversky and Kahneman (Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992) and Benartzi and Thaler (1995)—
producing thousands of citations. Loss aversion has been implicated in various portfolio choices
(Barberis 2013) and consumption dynamics (Kőszegi and Rabin 2009) that can lead to lower
wealth.

15
  The theoretical mapping from late loan repayments to our index of financial condition is unclear under
limited liability, and the average relationship (not conditioning on borrowing) more ambiguous, since
borrowing could lead to (weakly) greater or lesser wealth if consumers are behavioral (Zinman 2014).
     We measure loss aversion using the two choices developed by Fehr and Goette (2007) in
their study of the labor supply of bike messengers (see Abeler et al. (2011) for a similar
elicitation method). Choice 1 is between a lottery with a 50% chance of winning $80 and a 50%
chance of losing $50, and zero dollars. Choice two is between playing the lottery in Choice 1 six
times, and zero dollars. As Fehr and Goette (FG) show, if subjects have reference-dependent
preferences, then subjects who reject lottery 1 have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects
who accept lottery 1, and subjects who reject both lotteries have a higher level of loss aversion
than subjects who reject only lottery 1. In addition, if subjects' loss aversion is consistent across
the two lotteries, then any individual who rejects lottery 2 should also reject lottery 1 because a
rejection of lottery 2 implies a higher level of loss aversion than a rejection of only lottery 1.
Other researchers have noted that, even in the absence of loss aversion, choosing Option B is
compatible with small-stakes risk aversion. 16 We acknowledge this but use “loss aversion”
instead of “loss aversion and/or small-stakes risk aversion” as shorthand. Small-stakes risk
aversion is also often classified as behavioral because it is incompatible with expected utility
theory (Rabin 2000).

     Response rates suggest a high level of comfort with these questions; only two of our 1,515
subjects skip, and only two more who answer the first question do not answer the second. 37% of
our 1,511 respondents reject both lotteries, consistent with relatively extreme loss aversion,
compared to 45% of FG’s 42 subjects. Another 36% of our subjects accept both lotteries,
consistent with classical behavior, compared to 33% in FG. The remaining 27% of our subjects
(and 21% of FG’s) exhibit moderate loss aversion, playing one lottery but not the other, with our
main difference from FG being that 14% of our subjects (vs. only 2% of theirs) exhibit the
puzzling behavior of playing lottery 1 but not lottery 2. Although one wonders whether these
14% misunderstood the questions, we find only a bit of evidence in support of that interpretation:
those playing the single but not compound lottery have slightly lower cognitive skills than other
loss averters, conditional on our rich set of covariates, but actually have higher cognitive skills
than the most-classical group. And playing the single but not the compound lottery is
uncorrelated with our measure of ambiguity aversion, pushing against the interpretation that the



16
  A related point is that there is no known “model-free” method of eliciting loss aversion (Dean and
Ortoleva 2016).
compound lottery is sufficiently complicated as to appear effectively ambiguous (Dean and
Ortoleva 2016).

     All told 64% of our subjects indicate some loss aversion, defined as rejecting one or both of
the small-stakes lotteries, as do 67% in FG. In Abeler et al.’s (2011) student sample, 87% reject
one or more of the four small-stakes lotteries with positive expected value. The Abeler et al.
questions were also fielded in an ALP module from early 2013 used by Hwang (2016); 70% of
that sample exhibits some loss aversion. In von Gaudecker et al.’s nationally representative
Dutch sample, 86% exhibit some loss aversion, as inferred from structural estimation based on
data from multiple price lists. We also order sets of deviations to indicate greater degrees of loss
aversion, based on whether the individual respondent rejects the compound but not the single
lottery, rejects the single but not the compound lottery, or rejects both.

     Despite the massive amount of work on loss aversion, research exploring links between
directly elicited measures of loss aversion and field behavior is only beginning. von Gaudecker
et al. (2011) do not explore links between loss aversion and field behavior. Dimmock and
Kouwenberg (2010) do, like von Gaudecker et al. using CentERdata, but lack many important
covariates. Fehr and Goette (2007) find that loss aversion moderates the effect of a wage
increase, but their sample includes only bike messengers and lacks measures of many other
potentially moderating factors. Abeler et al. (2011) find that loss aversion is strongly correlated
with effort choices in the lab among their student sample, but again they lack data on many
covariates of interest. Hwang (2016) uses the Abeler et al. measures to infer a strong correlation
between loss aversion and insurance holdings in an earlier ALP module, but lacks many
important covariates and the only other behavioral factor considered is an interaction between
loss aversion and a measure of the Gambler’s Fallacy (labeled “Heuristics” in the Hwang
paper). 17

     We do not find evidence of a strong conditional correlation between loss aversion and
financial condition, although the coefficients are uniformly negative across specifications
(Tables 5-8 and Appendix Table 7), which is consistent with the hypothesis that loss aversion is
associated with lower wealth. Looking particularly at the component of our financial condition

17
  Hwang (2016) also discusses the potential (mediating) role of narrow framing/bracketing but lacks a
directly elicited measure of such.
index most directly linked to risk-taking—holding public equities—we do find stronger
correlations, with loss averse respondents 2.2pp (SE 2.3pp) less likely to hold stocks than
classical respondents (those who play both small-stakes lotteries). Specifying our loss aversion
measure categorically, we find that the most loss averse respondents (those who reject both
lotteries) are 4.1pp less likely to hold stocks than classical respondents (SE 2.7pp), again
conditional on our rich set of controls.

F. Narrow Bracketing and Dominated Choice
     Narrow bracketing refers to the tendency to make decisions in (relative) isolation, without
full consideration of other choices and constraints. Rabin and Weizsacker (2009) show that
narrow bracketing can lead to dominated choices—and hence expensive and wealth-reducing
ones—given non-CARA preferences.

     We measure narrow bracketing and dominated choice (NBDC) using two of the tasks in
Rabin and Weizacker (2009). Each task instructs the subject to make two decisions. Each
decision presents the subject with a choice between a certain payoff and a gamble. Each decision
pair appears on the same screen, with an instruction to consider the two decisions jointly. RW
administer their tasks with students and, like us, in a nationally representative online panel
(Knowledge Networks in their case). Like us, payoffs are hypothetical for their online panel.

     Our first task follows RW’s Example 2, with Decision 1 between winning $100 vs. a 50-50
chance of losing $300 or winning $700, and Decision 2 between losing $400 vs. a 50-50 chance
of losing $900 or winning $100. 18 As RW show, someone who is loss averse and risk-seeking in
losses will, in isolation (narrow bracketing) tend to choose A over B, and D over C. But the
combination AD is dominated with an expected loss of $50 relative to BC. Hence a broad-
bracketer will never choose AD. 29% of our subjects choose AD, compared to 53% in the most
similar presentation in RW.

     Our second task reproduces RW’s Example 4, with Decision 1 between winning $850 vs. a
50-50 chance of winning $100 or winning $1,600, and Decision 2 between losing $650 vs. a 50-
50 chance of losing $1,550 or winning $100. As in task one, a decision maker who rejects the

18
   Given the puzzling result that RW’s Example 2 was relatively impervious to a broad-bracketing
treatment, we changed our version slightly to avoid zero-amount payoffs. Thanks to Georg Weizsacker
for this suggestion.
risk in the first decision but accepts it in the second decision (A and D) violates dominance, here
with an expected loss of $75 relative to BC. 23% of our subjects choose AD, compared to 36%
in the most similar presentation in RW. As RW discuss, a new feature of task two is that AD
sacrifices expected value in the second decision, not in the first. This implies that for all broad-
bracketing risk averters AC is optimal: it generates the highest available expected value at no
variance. 50% of our subjects choose AC, compared to only 33% in the most similar presentation
in RW. I.e., 50% of our subjects do NOT broad-bracket in this task, compared to 67% in RW.

   Reassuringly, responses across our two tasks are correlated; this is especially reassuring
given that the two tasks appear non-consecutively in the survey, hopefully dampening any
tendency for a mechanical correlation. E.g., the unconditional correlation between choosing AD
across the two tasks is 0.34.

   1,486 subjects complete both tasks (out of the 1,515 who respond to at least one of our
questions in module 315). Putting the two tasks together to create summary indicators of narrow
bracketing, we find 59% of our subjects exhibiting some narrow bracketing in the sense of not
broad-bracketing on both tasks, while 13% narrow-bracket on both tasks. These are uni-
directional indicators: we either classify someone as narrow-bracketing, or not. RW do not create
summary indicators across tasks, but, as noted above, their subjects exhibit substantially more
narrow bracketing at the task level than our subjects do.

   Research linking directly-elicited measures of NBDC to field outcomes is just beginning.
The only paper we know of in this vein, Gottlieb and Mitchell (2015), uses a different method
for measuring narrow bracketing—one that does not allow for dominated choice—the Tversky
and Kahneman (1981) “sensitivity to framing” questions regarding the policy response to an
epidemic. 30% of subjects in the Health and Retirement Study choose different policy options
under the two different frames, an indicator of framing sensitivity, and this indicator is
negatively correlated with the holding of long-term care insurance, conditional on a rich set of
covariates include a measure loss aversion.

   We do not find any statistically significant conditional correlations between our measures of
narrow bracketing and our financial condition index.
G. Ambiguity Aversion

   Ambiguity aversion refers to a preference for known uncertainty over unknown
uncertainty—preferring, for example, a less-than-50/50 gamble to one with unknown
probabilities. It has been widely theorized that ambiguity aversion can explain various sub-
optimal portfolio choices, and Dimmock et al. (2016) find that it is indeed conditionally
correlated with lower stockholdings and worse diversification in their ALP sample (see also
Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker (2016)).

   We elicit a coarse measure of ambiguity aversion using just one or two questions about a
game that pays $500 if you select a green ball. The first question offers the choice between a Bag
One with 45 green and 55 yellow balls vs. a Bag Two of unknown composition. 1,397 subjects
respond to this question (out of 1,427 who answer at least one of our questions on ALP module
352). 73% choose the 45-55 bag, and we label them ambiguity averse. The survey then asks
these subjects how many green balls would need to be in Bag One to induce them to switch. We
subtract this amount from 50, dropping the 99 subjects whose response to the second question is
>45 (and the 10 subjects who do not respond), to obtain a continuous measure of ambiguity
aversion that ranges from 0 (not averse in the first question) to 50 (most averse= = = the three
subjects who respond “zero” to the second question). The continuous measure (N=1,288) has a
mean of 14 (median=10), and a SD of 13. If we impose a large-deviation threshold of 10 (20% of
the max) for labeling someone as ambiguity averse, 50% of our sample exceeds this threshold
and another 16% are at the threshold. Our elicitation does not distinguish between ambiguity-
neutral and ambiguity-seeking choices (for more comprehensive but still tractable methods see,
e.g., Dimmock, Kouwenberg et al. (2016), Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker (2016), Gneezy
et al. (2015)), and so our measure of deviation from ambiguity-neutrality is one-sided.

   Despite the coarseness of our elicitation, comparisons to other work suggest that it produces
reliable data. Our ambiguity aversion indicator correlates strongly with one constructed from
Dimmock et al.’s elicitation in the ALP (0.14, p-value 0.0001, N= 789), despite the elicitations
taking place roughly 3 years apart. Prevalence at our 10pp large-deviation cutoff nearly matches
that from Dimmock, Kouwenberg et al.’s (2016) ALP sample and Butler et al.’s (2014) Unicredit
Clients’ Survey sample from Italy, and the prevalence of any ambiguity aversion (0% cutoff)
nearly matches Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker’s (2016) from the Dutch version of the
ALP.

     Our predictive analysis builds on the papers by Dimmock and co-authors cited above, which
estimate conditional correlations between ambiguity aversion and financial market behavior, by
broadening the set of both outcomes and control variables (especially other B-factors). 19 We too
find evidence of statistically significant negative correlations between ambiguity aversion and
financial outcomes (Table 5-8 and Appendix Table 7).

H. Overconfidence

     Overconfidence has been implicated in excessive trading (Daniel and Hirshleifer 2015), over-
borrowing on credit cards (Ausubel 1991), paying a premium for private equity (Moskowitz and
Vissing-Jorgensen 2002; although see Kartashova 2014), and poor contract choice (Grubb 2015),
any of which can reduce wealth and financial security.

     We elicit three distinct measures of overconfidence, following e.g., Moore and Healy (2008).

     The first measures it in level/absolute terms, by following the three Banks and Oldfield
questions (Section 1-D) with the question: “How many of the last 3 questions (the ones on the
disease, the lottery and the savings account) do you think you got correct?” We then subtract the
respondent’s assessment from her actual score. 39% of 1,366 subjects are overconfident
(“overestimation” per Moore and Healy) by this measure (with 32% overestimating by one
question), while only 11% are underconfident (with 10% underestimating by one question).
Larrick et al. (2007), Moore and Healy, and other studies use this method for measuring
overestimation, but we are not aware of any that report individual-level prevalence estimates
(they instead focus on task-level data, sample-level summary statistics, and/or correlates of
cross-sectional heterogeneity in estimation patterns).

     The second measures overconfidence in precision, as indicated by responding “100%” on
two sets of questions about the likelihoods (of different possible Banks and Oldfield quiz scores
or of future income increases). This is a coarse adaptation of the usual approaches of eliciting



19
  The other paper we know of examining correlations between ambiguity attitudes and field behavior is
Sutter et al.’s (2013) study of adolescents in Austria.
several confidence intervals or subjective probability distributions (Moore and Healy). In our
data 34% of 1,345 responding to both sets respond 100% on >=1 set, and 10% on both.

   The third measures confidence in placement (relative performance), using a self-ranking
elicited before taking our number series test (Section 1-D): “We would like to know what you
think about your intelligence as it would be measured by a standard test. How do you think your
performance would rank, relative to all of the other ALP members who have taken the test?” We
find a better-than-average effect in the sample as a whole (70% report a percentile>median) that
disappears when we ask the same question immediately post-test, still not having revealed any
scores (50% report a percentile>median). We also construct an individual-level measure of
confidence in placement by subtracting the subject’s actual ranking from his pre-test self-ranking
(N=1,395). This measure is useful for capturing individual-level heterogeneity ordinally, but not
for measuring prevalence because the actual ranking is based on a 15-question test and hence its
percentiles are much coarser than the self-ranking.

   Among the three sets of pairwise correlations between measures of overconfidence at the
individual level, only placement and precision are not strongly correlated with each other. The
other two pairs have correlations ranging from 0.10 to 0.19 depending on functional form, with
p-values <0.001.

   We are not aware of any prior work exploring conditional correlations between the sorts of
overconfidence measures described above and field outcomes. Our results find the expected
negative conditional correlations with financial condition (especially strong for overconfidence
in relative performance), and some evidence for significant positive effect of under-confidence.

I. Non-belief in the Law of Large Numbers

   Under-weighting the importance of the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) can affect how
individuals treat risk (as in the stock market), or how much data they demand before making
decisions. In this sense non-belief in LLN (a.k.a. NBLLN) can act as an “enabling bias” for other
biases like loss aversion (Benjamin, Rabin, and Raymond 2016).

   Following Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin (see also D Kahneman and Tversky 1972; Benjamin,
Rabin, and Raymond 2016), we measure non-belief in law of large numbers (NBLLN) using
responses to the following question:
     … say the computer flips the coin 1000 times, and counts the total number of heads.
     Please tell us what you think are the chances, in percentage terms, that the total number
     of heads will lie within the following ranges. Your answers should sum to 100.


The ranges provided are [0, 480], [481, 519], and [520, 1000], and so the correct answers are 11,
78, 11.

     1,375 subjects respond (out of the 1,427 who answer at least one of our questions in Module
352), 20 with mean (SD) responses of 27 (18), 42 (24), and 31 (20). We measure NBLLN using
the distance between the subject’s answer for the [481, 519] range and 78. Only one subject gets
it exactly right. 87% underestimate; coupled with prior work, this result leads us to designate
underestimation as the “standard” directional bias. The modal underestimator responds with 50
(18% of the sample). The other most-frequent responses are 25 (10%), 30 (9%), 33 (8%), and 40
(7%). Few underestimators—only 4% of the sample—are within 10pp of 78, and their mean
distance is 43, with an SD of 17. 9% of the sample underestimates by 20pp or less. 13%
overestimate relative to 78, with 5% of the sample quite close to correct at 80, and another 5% at
100. Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin (2013) do not calculate individual-level measures of
underestimation or overestimation in their convenience sample, but do report that the sample
means are 35%, 36%, and 29% for the three bins. The comparable figures in our data are 27%,
42%, and 31%.

     We are not aware of any prior work exploring conditional correlations between directly-
elicited NBLLN and field outcomes. The sign pattern suggests those underestimating
convergence exhibit lesser financial condition in the cross-section, with larger underestimation
more strongly negatively correlated than the simple indicator (Appendix Table 7 vs. Tables 5-8).

J. Gambler’s Fallacies

     The Gambler’s Fallacies involve falsely attributing statistical dependence to statistically
independent events, in either expecting one outcome to be less likely because it has happened
recently (recent reds on roulette make black more likely in the future) or the reverse, a “hot
hand” view that recent events are likely to be repeated. Gambler’s fallacies can lead to

20
  Only 26 subjects provide responses that do not sum to 100 after a prompt, and each response for an
individual range is [0, 100], so we do not exclude any subjects from the analysis here.
overvaluation of financial expertise (or attending to misguided financial advice), and related
portfolio choices like the active-fund puzzle, that can erode wealth (Rabin and Vayanos 2010).
Because the hot hand fallacy is more closely linked to harmful financial behaviors such as
“return-chasing” or over-valuing the talent of stock-pickers (Rabin and Vayanos 2010), for
analyses linking the fallacies to field behavior we denote hot-hand as the “standard” bias and
cold-hand as “non-standard.”

     We take a slice of Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin’s (2013) elicitation for the fallacies:

     "Imagine that we had a computer “flip” a fair coin… 10 times. The first 9 are all heads.
     What are the chances, in percentage terms, that the 10th flip will be a head?"

1,392 subjects respond, out of the 1,427 respondents to module 352. The cold-hand fallacy
implies a response < 50%, while the hot-hand fallacy implies a response > 50%. Our mean
response is 45% (SD=25), which is consistent with the cold-hand but substantially above the
32% in Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin. Another indication that we find less evidence of the cold-
hand fallacy is that, while they infer that “at the individual level, the gambler’s fallacy [cold-
hand] appears to be the predominant pattern of belief” (2013, p. 16), we find only 26%
answering < “50.” 14% of our sample responds with >”50” (over half of these responses are at
“90” or “100”). So 60% of our sample answers correctly. Nearly everyone who responds with
something other than “50” errs by a substantial amount—e.g., only 2 % of the sample is [30, 50)
or (50, 70]. Sixteen percent of our sample answers “10,” 21 which Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin
speculates is an indicator of miscomprehension; we find that while subjects with this indicator do
have significantly lower cognitive skills than the unbiased group, they actually have higher
cognitive skills than the rest of subjects exhibiting a gambler’s fallacy.

     Dohmen et al. (2009) measure the fallacies using a similar elicitation that confronts a
representative sample of 1,012 Germans, taking an in-person household survey, with:

     Imagine you are tossing a fair coin. After eight tosses you observe the following result: tails-
tails-tails-heads-tails-heads-heads-heads. What is the probability, in percent, that the next toss is
“tails”?


21
  34% of the sample in Benjamin, Moore, and Raymond respond “10%” on one or more of their ten
questions.
     986 of Dohmen et al.’s respondents provide some answer to this question, 95 of whom say
“Don’t know.” Among the remaining 891, 23% exhibit cold-hand (compared to 26% in our
sample), and 10% exhibit hot-hand (compared to 14% in our sample). Conditional on exhibiting
cold-hand, on average subjects err by 29pp (40 pp in our sample). Conditional on exhibiting hot-
hand, the mean subject error is 27pp (39pp in our sample).

     Dohmen et al. also explore correlations between unemployment or bank overdrafts and their
directly-elicited fallacy measures, conditional on age, gender, education, income, and wealth.
They find evidence of positive correlations between hot-hand and unemployment and between
cold-hand and overdrafting. We find a general pattern of evidence that both fallacies are
negatively conditionally correlated with our financial condition index in point terms (Tables 5-8
and Appendix Table 7).

K. Exponential Growth Bias

     Exponential Growth Bias (EGB) produces a tendency to underestimate the effects of
compounding on costs of debt and benefits of saving. It has been linked to a broad set of
financial outcomes (Levy and Tasoff 2016; Stango and Zinman 2009).

     We measure EGB, following previous papers, by asking respondents to solve questions
regarding an asset’s future value or a loan’s implied annual percentage rate. Our first measure of
EGB follows in the spirit of Stango and Zinman (2009, 2011) by first eliciting the monthly
payment the respondent would expect to pay on a $10,000, 48 month car loan. The survey then
asks “… What percent rate of interest does that imply in annual percentage rate ("APR") terms?”
1,445 panelists answer both questions, out of the 1,515 respondents to Module 315. Most
responses appear sensible; e.g., there are mass points at 5%, 10%, 3%, 6% and 4%.

     We calculate an individual-level measure of “debt-side EGB” by comparing the difference
between the APR implied by the monthly payment supplied by that individual, and the perceived
APR as supplied directly by the same individual. We start by binning individuals into under-
estimators (the standard bias), over-estimators, unbiased, and unknown (37% of the sample). 22

22
  Non-response is relatively small, as only 4% of the sample does not respond to both questions. Most of
those we label as unknown-bias give responses that imply or state a 0% APR. 7% state payment amounts
that imply a negative APR, even after being prompted to reconsider their answer. We also classify the 4%
of respondents with implied APRs >=100% as having unknown bias.
The median level difference between the correct and stated value is 500bp, with a mean of
1,042bp and SD of 1,879bp. Among those with known bias, we count as biased 70%, 64%, 47%,
and 34% under error tolerance of zero, 100bp, 500bp, and 1000bp. Under these tolerances we
count 3%, 13%, 41%, and 61% as unbiased, and 27%, 22%, 10%, and 3% as negatively biased.
This is less EGB than Stango and Zinman (2009, 2011) see from questions in the 1983 Survey of
Consumer Finances, where 98% of the sample underestimates, and the mean bias is 1,800bp or
3,800bp depending on the benchmark. The time frames of the questions differ, which may
account for the difference (and is why we do not estimate an EGB structural model parameter to
compare with our prior work or that of Levy and Tasoff).

     Stango and Zinman (2009; 2011) find that more debt-side EGB is strongly conditionally
correlated with debt allocation, worse loan terms, and less savings and wealth. But those papers
lack direct controls for cognitive skills and other behavioral factors. Here we find no evidence of
a statistically significant correlation—whether or not we control for variables omitted in SZ, and
whether or not we consider our financial condition index as a whole or saving behavior or wealth
in particular.

     Our second measure of EGB comes from a question popularized by Banks and Oldfield
(2007) as part of a series designed to measure basic numeracy: “Let's say you have $200 in a
savings account. The account earns 10 percent interest per year. You don’t withdraw any money
for two years. How much would you have in the account at the end of two years?” 1,389 subjects
answer this question (out of the 1,427 respondents to Module 352), and we infer an individual-
level measure of “asset-side EGB” by comparing the difference between the correct future value
($242), and the future value supplied by the same individual. 23 We again bin individuals into
underestimators (the standard bias), overestimators, unbiased, and unknown (14% of the
sample). 24 Among those with known bias (N=1,222), the median bias is $0, with a mean of $2




23
   Responses to this question are correlated with responses to two other questions, drawn from Levy and
Tasoff (2016), that can also be used to measure asset-side EGB, but our sample sizes are smaller for those
two other questions and hence we do not use them here.
24
   We label as unknown the 8% of the sample answering with future value < present value, the 3% of the
sample answering with a future value > 2x the correct future value, and the 3% of the sample who skip
this question.
and SD of $14. 25 44% of our sample provides the correct FV. 47% of our sample underestimates
by some amount, with most underestimators (29% of the sample) providing the linearized
(uncompounded) answer of $240. Nearly all other underestimates provide an answer that fails to
account for even simple interest; the most common reply in this range is “$220.” Only 9% of our
sample overestimates the FV, with small mass points at 244, 250, 400, and 440.

     Other papers have used the Banks and Oldfield question, always—to our knowledge—
measuring accuracy as opposed to directional bias and then using a 1/0 measure of correctness as
an input to a financial literacy or numeracy score (e.g., James Banks, O ’Dea, and Oldfield 2010;
Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai 2012). Our tabs from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study
suggest, using only the youngest HRS respondents and our oldest respondents to maximize
comparability (ages 50-60 in both samples), that there is substantially more underestimation in
the HRS (74%, vs. 48% in our sample). 14% overestimate in the HRS among those aged 50-60,
vs. 9% in our sample.

     Goda et al. (2017) and Levy and Tasoff (2016) measure asset-side EGB using more difficult
questions in their representative samples. They find that 9% and 11% overestimate FVs, while
69% and 85% underestimate. We do not construct an EGB parameter to compare to theirs,
because our questions lack their richness and yield heavy mass points at unbiased and linear-
biased responses.

     The only prior paper we know looking directly at links between a measure of asset-side EGB
and field outcomes is Goda et al., who use data on fewer behavioral factors. They find significant
negative correlations between asset-side EGB and retirement savings. We also find negative
correlations, both with our financial condition index (Tables 5-8 and Appendix Table 7) and with
self-assessed retirement preparedness in particular.




25
  For calculating the mean and SD we truncate bias at -42 for the 4% sample answering with future
values 284<FV<485, to create symmetric extrema in the bias distribution since our definition caps bias at
42.
L. Limited Attention/Memory

     Prior empirical work has found that limited attention affects a range of financial decisions
(e.g., Barber and Odean 2008; DellaVigna and Pollet 2009; Karlan et al. 2016; Stango and
Zinman 2014). Behavioral inattention is a very active line of theory inquiry as well (e.g.,
Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2017; Kőszegi and Szeidl 2013; Schwartzstein 2014).

     In the absence of widely used methods for measuring limited attention and/or memory, we
create our own, using five simple questions and tasks.

     The first three ask, “Do you believe that your household's [horizon] finances… would
improve if your household paid more attention to them?” for three different horizons: “day-to-
day (dealing with routine expenses, checking credit card accounts, bill payments, etc.)”
“medium-run (dealing with periodic expenses like car repair, kids’ activities, vacations, etc.)”
and “long-run (dealing with kids' college, retirement planning, allocation of savings/investments,
etc.)” Response options are the same for each of these three questions: “Yes, and I/we often
regret not paying greater attention” (26%, 23%, and 35%), “Yes, but paying more attention
would require too much time/effort” (8%, 11%, and 12%), “No, my household finances are set
up so that they don't require much attention” (15%, 16%, and 13%), and “No, my household is
already very attentive to these matters” (52%, 51%, and 41%). We designed the question
wording and response options to distinguish behavioral limited inattention (“Yes… I/we
often…”)—which also includes a measure of awareness thereof in “regret”—from full attention
(“… already very attentive”), rational inattention, and/or a sophisticated response to behavioral
inattention (“Yes, but… too much time/effort”; “… set up so that they don’t require much
attention”).

     Responses are strongly but not perfectly correlated (ranging 0.56 to 0.69 among pairwise
expressions of regret). A fourth measure of limited attention is also strongly correlated with the
others, based on the question: “Do you believe that you could improve the prices/terms your
household typically receives on financial products/services by shopping more?” 26 18% respond
“Yes, and I/we often regret not shopping more,” and the likelihood of this response is correlated
0.25 with each of the regret measures above. 1,483 subjects answer all four questions, out of the

26
  This question is motivated by evidence that shopping behavior strongly predicts borrowing costs
(Stango and Zinman 2016).
1,515 respondents to Module 315. Summing the four indicators of attentional regret, we find that
49% of subjects have one or more (earning a classification of behavioral inattention), 29% have
two or more, 19% three or more, and only 6% have all four.

   Limited attention strongly and negatively correlates with financial condition across all
specifications. It is worth considering these correlations are somewhat mechanical, in the sense
that people with worse outcomes might be more likely to express regret ex-post (perhaps even
misattributing their lack of attention as a contributing factor). We designed the response options
to try to dampen this possibility, by building in consideration of tradeoffs, but nevertheless grant
that the possibility of a mechanical correlation looms larger here than for our other B-factors.

   We also seek to measure limited prospective memory, following previous work suggesting
that limited memory entails real costs like forgetting to redeem rebates (e.g., Ericson 2011). We
offer an incentivized task to subjects taking module 352: “The ALP will offer you the
opportunity to earn an extra $10 for one minute of your time. This special survey has just a few
simple questions but will only be open for 24 hours, starting 24 hours from now. During this
specified time window, you can access the special survey from your ALP account. So we can get
a sense of what our response rate might be, please tell us now whether you expect to do this
special survey.” 97% say they intend to complete the short survey, leaving us with a sample of
1,358. Only 14% actually complete the short survey. Failure to complete is weakly positively
correlated with our indicators of attentional regret described above, with correlations ranging
from 0.02 to 0.04, and p-values from 0.20 to 0.50.

   Our indicator of behavioral limited memory—(do not complete conditional on intending to
complete)—is a bit coarse. We suspect that some noise is introduced because our elicitation
makes it costless to express an intention to complete (in future research we plan to explore
charging a small “sign up” fee), thereby including in the indicator’s sample frame some subjects
who rationally do not complete the task. Relatedly, although we set the payoff for task
completion to be sufficiently high to dominate any attention/memory/time costs in marginal
terms for most subjects (the effective hourly wage is in the hundreds of dollars), it may well be
the case that the fixed cost exceeds $10 for some respondents.

   Despite the noise, our coarse indicator of limited prospective memory turns out to have the
expected negative and significant correlation with financial condition. This is the first work we
know of estimating the conditional relationship between limited memory and field outcomes in a
broad sample.

All models estimated using the nonlinear least squares version of the model in Andreoni and Sprenger (2012).
Background consumption:
In (2), estimated as a model parameter at the individual-level.
In (3), assumed to be the median value of individual-level daily spending as measured in ALP module 417 ($16.50), calculated over all respondents to that survey.
In (4), assumed to be the median value of individual-level daily spending as measured in ALP module 417, calculated over all respondents to that survey,
multiplied by the number of household members reported in our module containing the CTB (ALP 315).
In (5), measured directly using data on individual-level daily spending from ALP module 417.
In (6), measured directly using data on individual-level daily spending from ALP module 417, multiplied by the number of household members reported in our
module containing the CTB (ALP 315).
In (7), measured directly using individual-level spend data from two different points in time (modules 400 and 417).
