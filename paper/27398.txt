A persistent issue in environmental economics is whether growth is sustainable. Pollution is a key
driver of sustainability, which we define as an economy exhibiting falling pollution damages at
its balanced growth path. We deduct air pollution and carbon dioxide damages from the national
accounts for 163 countries between 1998 and 2018. Global pollution intensity fell from 1998 to
2008, remaining flat thereafter. China highlights the importance of defining sustainability in
terms of damages; between 2011 and 2018, physical measures of environmental quality
improved, but monetary damage increased by 50 percent. Sustainability based on emissions
ignores this rise in damage.

1     Introduction

A persistent issue in the field of environmental economics is whether observed patterns in
growth and development are sustainable. The determinants of an economy's sustainability
include population growth, capital intensity and technological progress, and relative rates of
savings and consumption. These are also essential elements in neoclassical growth models
(Solow, 1956). In fact, the very notion of a steady state income level, foremost in the Solow
model, evokes considerations of sustainability. This link became explicit when, writing in the
1970s, after the passage of landmark environmental legislation and during the energy crisis,
Solow (1974) proposed that man-made capital should accumulate to offset exhaustible natu-
ral resource depletion. Though framed in terms of intergenerational equity, sustainability is
at the crux of this and subsequent work (Hartwick, 1977). Also in the 1970s, Nordhaus and
Tobin (1973) proposed an augmentation of official output statistics to include (among other
omitted services) natural resources and the environment. The motivation was to align the
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) with a more inclusive measure of economic
welfare. Doing so would alleviate the apparent conflict between growth and degradation of
the natural environment. At issue were concerns about sustainability.
    These literatures are in agreement about what defines sustainable growth. Solow (1974)
points out that balanced growth, in which investment offsets depreciation, can sustain cor-
responding levels of consumption indefinitely. Equivalently Hamilton (1994, 1996) argued
sustainable growth requires non-negative capital accumulation, inclusive of both man-made
and natural capital.
    This paper infuses the broad based view of capital from the environmental account-
ing literature into the analysis of steady state income in neoclassical growth models. So
equipped, growth models of the sort developed by Solow (1956) are apt tools for assessments
of sustainable development.
    Although natural capital encompasses a wide and heterogeneous range of resources, we
focus on the case of environmental pollution. Our context reflects both data availability and

                                              1
that pollution is, perhaps, the most crucial determinant of society's sustainability. In this
setting, Brock and Taylor (2010) offer an important advance in the deployment of neoclassical
growth models to probe questions of sustainability by including physical emissions in a Green
Solow model. Brock and Taylor (2010) concluded that growth is sustainable if emissions fall
at the economy's balanced growth path.
   In contrast, this analysis invokes the Solow-Hamilton definition of sustainable growth
presented above. The appropriate measure of pollution in this context is monetary damage,
as this reflects natural capital depreciation. To this end, the present paper augments Solow's
model to include monetary pollution damage. We argue that growth is sustainable if damage
(rather than emissions) falls at the economy's balanced growth path, as man-made capital
accumulation is zero at this point. Rising pollution damage would induce net negative
comprehensive wealth accumulation, violating sustainable growth.
   We bring the augmented Solow model to a new dataset of integrated economic and
environmental accounts for over 160 countries between 1998 and 2018. The augmentation
occurs in two areas within the very broad environmental accounting context: monetary
damages from fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). To accomplish this,
we employ a globally comprehensive database on PM2.5 concentrations and CO2 emissions.
Using these data, the empirical analysis estimates monetary damage, or the Gross External
Damage (GED), by country-year (Muller, Mendelsohn and Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014,
2020). We then deduct gross damages from gross domestic product (GDP) to estimate
environmentally-adjusted value added (EVA). Thus, the paper produces the first set of global,
integrated environmental and economic accounts over a 21-year panel.Though our estimates
of EVA are not truly comprehensive, prior research shows that these two pollutants cause
damages comprising a considerable share of national output in the United States (Muller,
2020; Tschofen, Azevedo and Muller, 2019).
   The augmented Solow model developed in this paper yields an important insight. If
marginal damages rise with income, damages peak at a higher level of capital per worker


                                              2
than do emissions. The key implication of this is potentially divergent conclusions about
sustainability. If both emissions and damages peak either before or after an economy reaches
its balanced growth path, both yield the same inferences about sustainability. However, if
emissions peak before balanced growth and damages after, an economy may be deemed to
be growing sustainably, when, from the welfare-based definition proposed above, it is not.
   Our empirical results are summarized as follows. Globally, the pollution intensity of
output, defined as GED/GDP, fell from 1998 to 2008 and remained flat thereafter. High
income countries exhibit declining pollution intensity of output from 1998 to 2018. GED
comprised about 10% of GDP in 1998. By 2018, GED fell to under 7% of output. The
result of this attenuation of pollution intensity is to increase apparent growth. Though we
find a range of growth differentials across high income countries, we present a few notable
results here. EVA growth outpaced GDP growth in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by 50-100
basis points on average and in the United States (U.S.) by 30-40 basis points. In the other
large economies on the European continent, growth differentials were smaller. In addition,
most of the reductions in pollution intensity in the high income countries occurred before
the Great Recession.
   In marked contrast to the greening of the high income economies, upper middle income
countries became more pollution intensive. The GED in this group increased from over 7%
of GDP to about 10% in 2018. China drives this result. Despite a five-fold increase in real
GDP/capita, its GED began at 11 percent of GDP in 1998 and climbed to 13 percent of
GDP in 2018. Due to rising pollution intensity, EVA growth in China was appreciably less
rapid than GDP. In the early 2000s, the difference averaged 50 basis points.
   In the lower middle income group, pollution intensity grew modestly from 7% to 8% of
GDP. Perhaps most notable within this group of countries, India appears poised to follow
China's development path as its GED-to-GDP ratio ascended from 8 percent to 10 percent.
EVA growth in India lagged GDP by roughly 30-50 basis points after 2005. Finally, the lowest
income countries exhibit low levels of pollution intensity (4% of GDP) that was essentially


                                             3
constant.
   Bringing the augmented Solow model to the data, across all countries, damages appear
to peak at higher income levels than PM2.5 concentration and CO2 emissions. This has
potentially important implications for inferences about sustainable growth. Perhaps most
important from a global perspective are the results for China. Ambient levels of PM2.5
peaked in 2011. Emissions of CO2 , while increasing, have slowed considerably. Yet, the
monetary pollution damages in China, as of 2018, are still rising rapidly. There is no better
evidence of the importance of our proposed measure of sustainability, relative to one based
on emissions.
   While the present paper is the first to develop a global scale set of integrated environ-
mental and economic accounts, the analysis builds on a long literature in environmental
accounting. This includes Nordhaus and Tobin (1973), Bartelmus (2009), as well as more
recent work focusing on environmental accounting of the U.S. economy (Muller, Mendel-
sohn and Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014, 2020). The conceptual framework for integration
of environmental pollution damage was established by Nordhaus and Kokkelenberg (1999),
Abraham and Mackie (2006), and Nordhaus (2006). This analysis also draws on the growth
literature, from the early work of Harrod (1939) and Domar (1946) to the neoclassical Solow
(1956) model and more recently to Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992); Mankiw, Phelps and
Romer (1995). And as mentioned above, the present paper builds on Brock and Taylor
(2010). An additional set of papers, of which Brock and Taylor (2010) is an example, fo-
cusing on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is also highly relevant to the present
work (Brock and Taylor., 2003; Andreoni and Levinson, 2001). In particular, Andreoni and
Levinson (2001) who focus on the role of returns to scale in abatement technology in driving
the shape of the EKC, also note that the disutility from pollution (hence, damages) may
shift the income-consumption-pollution paths. Though clearly pertinent to the present anal-
ysis, Andreoni and Levinson (2001) did not concentrate on the role of damages in long-run
sustainability considerations.

    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical
model. Section 3 divulges data sources and empirical methods. Section 4 presents results
and 5 concludes.



2       Model

Similar to Solow (1956) and Brock and Taylor (2010), we consider a one sector growth model
of the form:
                                            Y = F (K, BL)                                              (1)

    where Y is output, F is a concave production function with constant returns to scale
which depends on capital (K), labor (L), and productivity (B). We adopt the notation from
Brock and Taylor (2010); let n= the growth rate of population, gB = the rate of productivity
growth, and  is the fraction of output allocated to abatement:  = FA /F. Emissions are
then described as:
                                              E = F a()                                                (2)

    where  is the intensity of pollution, or emissions per unit of output, and a() is a concave
abatement function: a() = [1 - A(FA /F)]. Further, let gA = exogenous technological progress
in abatement. We augment this framework from Brock and Taylor (2010) by introducing
monetized pollution damages as shown in (3), where (V) is the marginal damage of pollution
emissions.:
                                             D = V F a()                                               (3)

    Then, gV is the exogenous growth rate in marginal damages, which may be influenced
by income (capital per worker) and population growth1 . Following Brock and Taylor (2010),
    1
    While gV is likely to be endogenous with respect to (k), we assume that gV is exogenous. Note, assuming
exogeneity of gV does not imply constant damage. Rather, the rate of growth in gV is exogenous to (k).




                                                    5
we describe output (net of investment in abatement), emissions, and damages, per capita:


                                          y = f (k )[1 - ]                                   (4)

                                           e = f (k )a()                                     (5)

                                         d = f (k )V a()                                     (6)


      where y = Y/BL, k = K/BL, e= E/BL, d = D/BL, and f(k) = F(k, 1).
      Next, we integrate monetary pollution damage into a measure of net per capita output.
Let r = the pre-abatement level of damages expressed as a fraction of output, and µ = the
elasticity of damages with respect to abatement. Then, net damage, per unit of output, is
given by [r - µ].
      This enables an expression of damage-adjusted output:


                                    y = f (k )[1 -  - [r - µ]]                               (7)


The rate of change of this adjusted measure of capital per effective worker is shown in (8).


                            = sf (k )[1 -  - [r - µ]] - [ + g B + n]k
                           k                                                                 (8)

      The rate of change is increasing in the fraction of output available for consumption
accumulated through savings (s) (net of investment in abatement and damage) and it is
decreasing in population growth (n), productivity growth gB , and depreciation ( ).
      Assuming the production function is Cobb Douglas, f(k) = k , where  is the capital
share of output, which is fixed by assumption. Then, the proportional rate of change in (k),
is:


                            k
                              = sk -1 [1 -  - [r - µ]] - [ + g B + n]                        (9)
                            k

      Solving the differential equation in (9) yields an expression for the capital per effective

                                                 6
worker at time (t):


                       k (t) = [k *(1-) (1 - exp(-t)) + k (0)1- exp(-t)]1/(1-)                              (10)


    where k(0) is initial capital per effective worker and k* is the economy's balanced growth
path, which is found by setting (9) to zero and solving for: k* = ( s(1- -[r-µ])
                                                                        +g +n
                                                                                 )                 1/(1-)
                                                                                                            . As
                                                                                         B

in Brock and Taylor (2010), k(t) is a weighted-average of k(0) and k* . Further,  = (1 -
)( + g B + n) is the speed of the economy's adjustment between the initial and balanced
growth path. Note that the introduction of neither emissions nor damage affects this rate of
adjustment.
    From (2) and (3) we derive the expression for the growth rate of total emissions and
damages. To do so, we introduce the following notation from Brock and Taylor (2010);
gE denotes the growth rate of emissions as the economy follows the balanced growth path.
Emissions grow according to the difference between technological progress, gB , population
growth (n), and abatement, gA : g E = g B + n - g A .

                                                E    k
                                                   =  + gE                                                  (11)
                                                E    k
                                            D    k
                                              =  + gE + gV                                                  (12)
                                            D    k

    The difference between (11) and (12) clearly depends on gV , the growth rate of marginal
            2
damages.        If gV is positive damages grow more rapidly than emissions. Conversely, if gV is
negative emissions outpace damages. The only situation in which (11) = (12) is if marginal
damages are constant.
    We next turn to the task of identifying the level of capital per worker at which emissions
and damages peak. Conceptually, the position of these maxima relative to the balanced
growth path is a critical determinant of an economy's sustainability. Brock and Taylor
   2
     In the case of CO2 , gV is the growth rate of the social cost of carbon. In the case of local pollutants gV
is the growth of the valuation placed on attributable mortality risk, also called the Value of Statistical Life.

(2010) deem growth sustainable if emissions fall on the balanced growth path. We propose
that growth is sustainable when net savings, or changes in capital per worker, inclusive of
abatement and damages, is non-negative.

k* . In contrast, if g E > 0, then k (T 1 ) > k * and emissions rise at k* . Therefore, Brock and
Taylor (2010) deem growth sustainable if g E < 0.
     We substitute (9) into (12) which yields:

                                             s(1 -  - [r - µ])             1
                              k (T 2) = (                 (g E +g V )
                                                                        ) (1-)                    (14)
                                             + gB + n -        


     How damages affect inferences about sustainability hinges on a comparison of (13) and
(14). This comparison is the central conceptual contribution of the paper and it hinges on gV .
Empirical evidence suggests that gV > 0, provided real positive income growth (Robinson
and Hammitt, 2009; Hammitt and Robinson, 2011; IWG, 2013). This implies that T 2 > T 1 ;
damages peak at a higher capital per worker level than emissions. This result has critical
implications for inferences about sustainable growth. We evaluate sustainability at k* , where
k
k
    = 0. Hence, by (12), sustainable growth requires that the growth rate of abatement must
counteract the growth in emissions and the growth in marginal damages. That is, damages
                                                                   k
must be weakly falling: g A >= g B + n + g V . Since               k
                                                                        = 0, rising damage reduces net
consumption. This violates the welfare-based definition of sustainability. Also note that by
definition at k* , gV for local pollutants (the VSL) is zero because income is unchanged at
k*. From (12), at k*, damages from air pollution grow at gE . For CO2 , gV is growth in
the social cost of carbon. At k* , gV may be positive because the SCC is determined by the

                                                   8
atmospheric stock of CO2 rather than real income growth. Therefore (12) implies that even
at k* damages from CO2 may still be rising even if g E <= 0.
     In certain cases, the distinction between emission and damage-based sustainability may
be innocuous. For example, if k (T 1 ) < k (T 2 ) < k * , then growth is sustainable under either
definition. Conversely, if k(T1 ) and (T2 ) exceed k* , then growth is unsustainable under either
definition. In contrast, if k (T 1 ) < k * < k (T 2 ), then focusing on emissions would lead to the
erroneous conclusion that growth is sustainable. In this case, emissions fall, but damages rise
without limit as the economy approaches k* . Accordingly, net savings is negative because
k
k
    = 0. And, as argued by Hamilton (1994, 1996), such an outcome cannot be sustainable.
     Table 1 displays the differences in the characterizations of the balanced growth path in
Solow (1956), Brock and Taylor (2010), and the present paper. The innovation from Brock
and Taylor (2010) relative to Solow (1956), was the inclusion of abatement expenditures ()
which necessarily reduces k* , the steady state income level. We further augment net savings
by including damages, as shown in the bottom-left cell of Table 1. This further reduces k* .
Comparing k(T1 ) from Brock and Taylor (2010) to equation (13), both shown in the middle
column of Table 1, reveals that including damage in (7) lowers k(T1 ) in (13), relative to
k(T1 ) in Brock and Taylor (2010). We contend that this is the preferred measure of net
savings because it facilitates the definition of sustainable growth invoked above.

3     Data

This section describes data sources and computational methods for CO2 and PM2.5 damages.
It concludes with a discussion of the integration of damages into the NIPAs.
    CO2 emissions are obtained from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Re-
search (EDGAR), (Crippa et al., 2019).To compute monetary damages from CO2 emissions
we use the social cost of carbon (SCC), which is the marginal damage per ton of CO2 emit-
ted. Estimates of the SCC vary widely in the literature. We use estimates from the US
Government's Interagency Working Group (IWG) study (IWG, 2013) which provides esti-
mates of the SCC for 2010-2050 every five years. We compute the SCC for relevant years in
our dataset by deriving the year on year growth rate. We use a central estimate of $36 (in
2007 dollars) in 2015 which corresponds to the 3% discount rate. We also perform sensitivity
analysis employing a high damage scenario which implies significantly higher values for the
SCC. The SCC is uniform across countries because CO2 is a globally-mixed pollutant. Dam-
ages from CO2 , denoted (Di,t C ), for country i in year t are the product of marginal damages
and emissions:


                                    Di,t C = E i,t C  SCC t                              (15)

    Although exposure to air pollution is associated with a number of adverse health and pro-
ductivity impacts, this analysis computes the monetary damage from attributable mortality
risk associated with PM2.5 exposure. We focus on this health endpoint because prior research
shows that it comprises the majority of pollution damage (EPA, 1999, 2011; Muller, Mendel-
sohn and Nordhaus, 2011). The key data sources for these calculations include the following.
Air pollution estimates as population weighted annual average PM2.5 concentration for coun-
try and year are obtained from a combination of model output, satellite observations, and
ground-based measurements following Hammer et al. (2020); Van Donkelaar et al. (2016).
In addition to the PM2.5 concentrations, we employ global data for baseline mortality risk


                                              10
and population (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018).3
    The calculation of damage from PM2.5 begins with the estimation of the relative risk
from PM2.5 exposure. The relative risk is a function of the PM2.5 concentration and it is
calculated through the integrated exposure response (IER) function, which is widely used in
international assessments of mortality risk from PM2.5 exposure (Cohen et al., 2017; Burnett
et al., 2018).


                                                                                     j,k
                      IERj,k,i,t (P M i,t ) = 1 + j,k  (1 - e- j,k (P M i,t -P M cf )      )              (16)

    where j,k , j,k , and j,k are statistically-estimated parameters4 , PMi,t is the level of PM2.5
concentration for country (i) in year (t), and PMcf the theoretical minimum risk exposure
level below which no risk is assumed. The subscript (j) denotes denotes the cause of death,
which includes stroke, lower respiratory infections, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer. The subscript (k) denotes age group. The
IER function was fitted by estimating the parameters j,k , j,k , j,k , and PMcf using the
methodology described in Cohen et al. (2017). The contributed risk is:


                                                                1
                                   P AF j,k,i,t = 1 -                                                     (17)
                                                        IERj,k,i,t (P M i,t )

    where PAF is the pollution attributable fraction, i.e. the risk contributed from PM2.5
exposure. Note that if PM=PMcf , IER =1, then the contributed risk is 0 (there is no
additional risk from PM2.5 exposure).
    Attributable excess mortality from exposure is estimated by evaluating (16) and (17)
using the country and year specific ambient PM2.5 data, and then computing the product
of (17) and age group (k) and cause (j) specific baseline mortality rates  along with the
   3
      Data across all five variables - GDP, CO2 emissions, PM2.5 , baseline mortality risk, and population - is
available for a total of 163 countries between 1998-2017. Further, given that data for GDP, CO2 emissions,
and PM2.5 is also available for 2018, we produce provisional results for 2018 using 2017 baseline mortality
risk and population data.
    4
      Note that the age group specific IER only applies to stroke and ischemic heart disease (Cohen et al.,
2017; Burnett et al., 2018)


                                                      11
relevant population age groups for each end point. Excess mortality M attributable to
PM2.5 for country (i) in year (t) can then be expressed as:

                                  j   k
                    M i,t =                 P AF j,k,i,t  j,k,i,t  P opulationj,k,i,t       (18)
                                 j =1 k=1

   Calculating monetary damage requires the application of the VSL to the estimated PM2.5 -
attributable excess mortality.
                                      Di,t P = M i,t  V SLi,t                               (19)

   where VSLi,t is the value of statistical life (VSL) for country (i) in time (t). For the U.S.,
we employ the U.S.EPA's VSL of $7.4 million ($2006) and run a sensitivity for a VSL of $2.8
million ($2000) based on contingent valuation studies (Kochi, Hubbell and Kramer, 2006).
Most countries do not use VSLs in environmental regulatory analyses. As such, we lack
government-endorsed, or official VSLs for applications in most countries aside from the U.S.
We estimate VSLs for other countries based on VSL-income elasticities from the literature.
Country-by-year income data for 1998 to 2018 are obtained from the World Bank (World
Bank, 2019).
   The particular elasticities employed depend on country income levels. Robinson and
Hammitt (2009), Hammitt and Robinson (2011), and Cropper and Sahin (2009) have argued
that higher elasticities are more appropriate for lower income countries. Estimates from
stated preference studies also suggest that the VSL-income elasticity is higher in lower income
countries. Masterman and Viscusi (2018), for instance, find an income elasticity of 0.55-
0.85 for higher income countries and 1.0 for lower income nations. Narain and Sall (2016)
suggest an elasticity of 0.8 for high income economies and 1.2 for low and middle income
countries. These elasticities were subsequently used in Rauner et al. (2020). We follow
this latter parameterization of the VSL-income elasticity. One justification for adopting this
approach is that it was endorsed by the World Bank. If countries around the world produced
integrated environmental and economic accounts, they would likely do so in accordance


                                                     12
with international standards which might include this guidance from the World Bank. In
a sensitivity analysis, we set the VSL-income elasticity to unity for all countries. Finally,
within a country, the VSL is held fixed cross-sectionally as is standard practice (EPA, 1999;
Shindell et al., 2012).
    The VSL for country i in 2006 is:


                                            Incomei,2006 
                          V SLi,2006 = (                  ) i,2006  V SLU S,2006            (20)
                                           IncomeU S,2006

    and then,


                                             Incomei,t 
                              V SLi,t = (                ) i,t  V SLi,2006                  (21)
                                            Incomei,2006

    where  is the VSL-income elasticity.
    Having estimated air pollution and CO2 damages, we integrate these values into the
national income and product accounts as follows. We calculate EVA as GDP less damages
(Muller, 2020, 2014). GDP for each country from 1998 to 2018 in constant 2010 USD5 is
obtained from the World Bank (World Bank, 2018).


                                 EV Ai,t = GDP i,t - Di,t P - Di,t C                        (22)

    The conceptual justification for this treatment of damages is provided in Nordhaus (2006)
and Abraham and Mackie (2006).



4       Results

The results begin with a global comparison of EVA and GDP growth. Next is an exploration
of the rates of growth in EVA and GDP among the eight largest economies in the world.
The relative rates of growth in EVA and GDP depend critically on changes in the pollution

intensity of output, which is also discussed below. In the third subsection, the scope of the
analysis is expanded to include all countries grouped by income class. Next the analysis
covers BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The fifth subsection conducts
assessment of the relationship between emissions, monetary damages, and GDP per capita
which links the empirical and conceptual models. We conclude with a brief summary from
the sensitivity analysis.


4.1    Global Growth Comparison

Globally, from 1998 to the Great Recession, EVA outpaced GDP growth. This difference
began between 20 and 30 basis points. This positive spread suggests that the global economy
was becoming less pollution intensive. However, by 2010, the EVA and GDP growth rates
were equivalent. After 2015, global GDP growth exceeded EVA by 5 to 10 basis points. These
results are shown in Appendix figure A1. We next examine results for specific countries.


4.2    Pollution Intensity in the Largest Economies

Figure 1 examines the growth rates of EVA and GDP for the eight largest economies in the
world (as measured by GDP). For the U.S., EVA growth has generally outpaced GDP growth.
Figure 2 shows why this is the case. The U.S. damage-to-output ratio ratio fell from about
10% in 1998 to 6% in 2018. This reduction was partially due to environmental regulatory
constraints as well as market forces including the rise of cheap natural gas and the resulting
displacement of coal-fired capacity in the electricity generation sector (Muller, 2020; Holland
et al., 2020). Prior to the Great Recession, EVA growth exceeded GDP growth by about
30-40 basis points. Since then, the rate differential is considerably smaller. This finding
comports with earlier estimates of EVA and GDP growth in the U.S. (Muller, 2014, 2020).
Figures A2 and A3 in the appendix plot ambient PM2.5 and CO2 emissions. In the U.S.,
CO2 emissions peaked just prior to the Great Recession. Ambient PM2.5 fell consistently
from 1998 to 2018.

economies by GDP (1999-2018)
Note: 2018 results are provisional and calculated using 2017 data for population and baseline
mortality risk along with 2018 data for PM, carbon emissions and GDP.


   For China, the world's second largest economy, the results look very different. The 1998
to 2018 period was transformative for China. Real GDP per capita grew by a factor of five.
This meteoric income growth had well known implications for the physical environment.
PM2.5 increased by nearly 50% for the first 15 years of the analysis, and fell thereafter (see
figure A2). Likewise, CO2 emissions climbed rapidly until 2011, when the rate of increase
declined (figure A3). Figure A4 reports that real GED increased by nearly a factor of seven
from 1998 to 2018. The rate of increase in GED fell slightly in 2011, when ambient PM2.5
fell and CO2 emission growth slowed. This rise in GED was a function of the more than
seven fold increase in the marginal value of mortality risk or the VSL (Figure A5).
   With a seven fold increase in GED and a five fold increase in GDP, China's economy
became more pollution intensive. Figure 2 confirms this. In 1998, GED amounted to under


                                             15
11 percent of GDP. By 2011, GED climbed relative to GDP such that pollution intensity
topped 13 percent. After the Great Recession, GED-to-GDP plateaued. This corresponds
to the period of falling ambient PM2.5 levels and deceleration in CO2 emission growth.
   The rapid ascent in environmental pollution damage in China significantly affected ap-
parent growth rates. China's GDP growth outpaced EVA by between 25 and 50 basis points
prior to 2011. This corresponds to when pollution intensity was rising. After 2012, pollution
intensity started to fall in China, and EVA growth modestly surpassed GDP.
   Also in Asia, Japan exhibited much smaller differences between EVA and GDP growth.
Contributing to this small difference were nearly constant ambient PM2.5 levels and CO2
emissions (see figures A2 and A3). The EVA - GDP spread was negative on average. Figure
2 shows that damages were about 7% of GDP in 1998 and grew to just under 8% in 2018.
   We next turn to the largest European economies. Early in the sample period, prior to
2005, German EVA grew more rapidly than GDP by between 50 and 100 basis points on
average. The EVA-GDP growth differential then rapidly attenuated, falling to near zero
after 2005. Figure 2 indicates that pollution damage amounted to about 13% of GDP in
1998. Pollution intensity fell to under 9% by 2007. It remained at roughly this level until
2018.
   In the U.K. EVA consistently outpaced GDP growth. Prior to 2005, EVA growth ex-
ceeded GDP growth by between 50 and 100 basis points on average. After the Great Re-
cession, EVA expansion fell relative to GDP such that the rates were roughly equal toward
the end of the sample period. Figure 2 demonstrates that pollution intensity in the U.K. fell
very rapidly from about 14% in 1998 (similar to Germany) to 9% in 2004. The damage to
output ratio in the U.K. continued to drop to under 7% in 2018. Over this 21 year period,
pollution intensity in the U.K. fell by one-half. The continued decline in pollution intensity
from 2005 to 2018 stands in stark contrast to the persistently higher damage to GDP ratio
in Germany after 2005.
   In France, EVA and GDP growth were quite similar from 1998 to 2018. France is highly


                                             16
dependent on nuclear energy and has generally low air pollution and CO2 emissions per unit
GDP. Because of this, as depicted in figure 2, its GED-to-GDP ratio in 1998 was much lower
than that of either the U.K. or Germany. And, without the rapid reduction in pollution
intensity observed in the U.K. and Germany, EVA and GDP growth rates did not diverge
as much.
   Italy's results bear similarities to the German economy. Prior to the financial crisis, EVA
growth tended to exceed GDP growth as GED-to-GDP fell from 11% to 9%. However, in the
last years of the sample, the EVA-GDP growth differential has converged because pollution
intensity did not continue to fall.
   Figures A2 and A3 report emissions and ambient pollution levels in the European economies
included in figures 1 and 2. In each of these countries, CO2 emissions fell, but very slowly.
Likewise, ambient PM2.5 fell from average values in 1998 of around 20 µg/m3 . The degree
of decline essentially explains the growth differentials in figure 1. That is, the U.K. exhibits
the steepest decline in ambient PM2.5 , whereas the levels in Germany and Italy remained
higher.
   Whereas China's economy grew rapidly more pollution intensive and then began to show
evidence of leveling off, India presents a case of a large developing economy just beginning
to increase in pollution intensity. From 1998 to 2004, EVA and GDP growth were roughly
equivalent. After 2004, GDP per capita began to accelerate ultimately doubling by 2018.
Well-documented pollution problems ensued. Figure A2 reports just how rapid the growth
in ambient pollution was; PM2.5 levels increased from about 50 µg/m3 in 2005 to almost
80 µg/m3 in 2012. GED increased by a factor of three from 2005 to 2018 (figure A4).
Accordingly, figure 2 demonstrates a steady increase in the pollution intensity of the Indian
economy from under 8% in 2005 to over 10% in 2018. The result of this was that EVA
growth dipped below GDP by as much as 50 basis points after 2005.
   Summarizing the results in figures 1 and 2, suggests that there are essentially two patterns
at work. In the U.S. and the Western European economies, pollution intensity fell. These

in CO2 emissions have been driven by an increase in renewable energy and a fall in energy
use. Among these economies, pollution intensity fell the most in the U.K. For the U.S. and
Western Europe, most of the reductions in pollution intensity occurred from 1998 to 2005.
All of these countries have essentially constant pollution intensity from 2010-2018, after the
Great Recession.
   In China, India, and Japan, pollution intensity increased. China, while exhibiting a rapid
increase in damage intensity up to 2015, appears to be transitioning to a phase in which
pollution damages are falling relative to GDP. India, however, just began to exhibit signs
of rising pollution intensity in 2005. It is important to note that because of the geographic
justification of Japan with respect to China and South Korea, it is likely that some of the
rise in pollution damages is due to transboundary flows of PM2.5 constituents from China

                                             18
and South Korea eastward into Japan.

A7.


4.3     Pollution Intensity by Income Group

While the preceding analysis focuses on the eight largest economies in the world, figure 3
groups all countries according to income status6 and it displays the GDP-weighted GED
to GDP ratios. The top-left panel shows that high income countries have had declining
pollution intensities from about 10 percent to 7 percent of GDP. This aggregate result is in
accord with the results for the high income countries shown in figure 2. Appendix figure
A8 shows average GDP per capita growth rates. High income countries exhibited growth
of about 2% from 1998 to 2008, near zero from 2008 to 2011, and 1% thereafter. In high
income countries there was a steady rate of decline in damage intensity despite significant
variation in income growth over the business cycle.
   For economies in the European Union (EU) GED declined from 11 percent of GDP in
1998 to 7 percent in 2018. We also report that for countries in the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme (EU ETS), a cap-and-trade program limiting CO2 emissions, GED-to-GDP declined
from about 9 percent in 2005 (the start of the EU ETS) to 7 percent in 2018.
   The top-right panel of the figure highlights upper-middle income countries. In short,
pollution intensity of these nations, which includes China, increased from over 7% in 1998
to almost 10% in 2018. The increase in pollution intensity was quite steady, with a slight
reduction in trend over the Great Recession. In Figure A9, shown in the appendix, we
recreate this graph without China. The remaining countries in the upper-middle income
group essentially had flat pollution intensity of about 6-7% between 1998 and 2018. The
comparison of figures 3 and A9 highlights the extent to which China is an outlier. No other
   6
    Countries are grouped according to their income status in 2018. Graphing according to current year
income status produced odd results when large countries such as China moved out of the lower middle income
group to the higher middle income group.

large economy grew in pollution intensity like China. And, because of the magnitude of the
Chinese economy, this has clear ramifications for global sustainability.
   In contrast to the upper middle income countries, the lower middle income countries
exhibit a very gradual increase in pollution intensity, rising from 7% of GDP in 1998 to
about 8% in 2018. India is included in this group. As such, some portion of the post 2004
increase in pollution intensity stems from the substantial pollution intensification of the
Indian economy.
   Along the four income groups in figure 2, low income economies show the lowest pollution
intensity of output. The GED remain at roughly 4% of GDP from 1998 to 2018. Figure
A8 indicates that these countries experienced GDP growth beginning at about 1% in 1998
and rising to about 3% in 2005. GDP growth held at roughly that rate for the remainder of
the sample. The steady damage-to-output ratio suggests that these countries have neither

                                             20
invested in abatement nor have they embarked on development trajectories of the sort evinced
in China and India where growth in real output stimulates greater pollution intensity.
   A review of the results in figure 3 provides a useful perspective on how the pollution
intensity of output changes over the development trajectory of the world's economies. As
noted above, pollution damage intensity as a share of GDP was consistently lowest among
nations with very low per capita income levels. For nearly the entire 21-year period from
1998 to 2018, damage intensity in the lower middle income category was consistently two
times greater than the low income countries. The gap between pollution intensity in the
lower middle and upper middle groups was essentially zero in 1998. However, over the next
21 years, pollution intensity levels in the lower middle and upper middle income groups
diverged as China's GDP and GED-to-GDP ratios increased substantially.
   Next, the 10% GED-to-GDP ratio in the high income countries in 1998 was higher than
the intensity level in both middle income groups at that time. However, by 2018, pollution
intensity was lower in the high income group than both the upper middle and low middle
income countries.
   So, in 1998 pollution intensity increased with income levels; from 4% to 7% to 10%
up the income scale. However, in 2018, this monotonically-increasing relationship between
pollution intensity and per capita GDP broke down. In 2018, pollution intensity increased
with income, up to a point, and then fell at the highest income levels. The emergent, non-
monotonic, or inverted "U-shaped" relationship between damage intensity and income is
suggestive of an EKC. We return to this topic in more detail in Section 4.5.


4.4    BRICS

We next turn to an analysis of the five major emerging economies often referred to as
`BRICS': Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. These economies are often grouped
together because of their emerging status and likely importance for global growth outcomes.
Figures A10, A11, and A12 in the appendix summarize the results for these countries. Figure


                                            21
A10 displays the real per capita GDP indexed to the 1998 values. As is well known, China's
real per capita income increase by more than five-fold between 1998 and 2018. Russia and
India enjoyed more than a doubling of real incomes, while Brazil and South Africa exhibit
an increase of 25 and 40 percent respectively. These varied growth outcomes mapped into
equally heterogeneous pollution damage growth. Figure A11 shows that GED in China
increased by nearly seven times. India's GED increased by five times. The GED in South
Africa, Russia, and Brazil all roughly doubled. Figure A12 displays the indexed pollution
intensity in these five nations. First, China and India have incurred increases in pollution
intensity of about 30 percent and 16 percent from 1998 to 2018, respectively. However, while
China's pollution intensity increased beginning shortly after the year 2000, India's did not
increase until after 2005. Brazil and South Africa have essentially flat pollution intensity. In
contrast to the other countries, Russia shows no consistent change in pollution intensity until
after the Great Recession, when damage-to-output fell by about 10%. The analysis of BRICS
conveys two conclusions. First, China and India exhibited large increases in per capita GDP
but also in GED intensity, though the timing of these increases differ markedly. Second,
the experiences in Brazil, South Africa, and Russia are notably different. Though Russia's
real income doubled, its pollution intensity fell. As a result EVA growth was consistently
higher than conventional growth between 2005-2013 (figure A13). In South Africa and Brazil,
pollution intensity was at the same level in 1998 and 2018 despite significant increases to
real income.


4.5    Environmental Kuznets Curve

This section tests the predictions of the conceptual model that physical emissions maximize
at lower levels of income than damages. We treat PM2.5 concentrations as a proxy for
emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors, since PM2.5 concentrations are more precisely defined
and measured than emissions, and since PM2.5 concentrations and emissions are closely
related. Figure 4 plots measures of emissions of CO2 , population weighted average ambient


                                              22
concentrations of PM2.5 , and monetary damages, for each country-year pair, against real per
capita GDP. Figure 4, which displays flexible cubic splines fit to the data, provides empirical
support for the predictions of the conceptual model. Beginning with PM2.5 concentration,
figure 4 shows that concentrations for countries at very low income levels are very high,
nearly 40 µg/m3 . Concentrations then fall rapidly with income before exhibiting a local
maximum around $20,000 income levels. Thereafter, PM2.5 levels fall as income grows. CO2
emissions, in contrast, rise rapidly with income at income levels under $20,000. Emissions
then level off, continuing to rise, but at a slower rate. Monetary damages also rise rapidly
at low income levels. In contrast to CO2 emissions, damages continue to rise rapidly with
income.




Figure 4: EKC curve showing emissions peaking earlier than damages. The brown line in
the plot is population weighted average ambient PM2.5 concentration and the blue line is
CO2 emissions per capita. The red line is GED/capita as measured on the secondary Y axis
on the right.


   To further explore the relationship between income levels and CO2 emissions, figure
A14 plots quadratic fits for damages and CO2 emissions. This exercise provides compelling
support for the predictions of the conceptual model. CO2 emissions maximize at about 15

                                              23
tons per capita, per year at an income level of about $70,000. In contrast, monetary damages
peak at an income level of about $130,000. The per capita damage at the apex is roughly
$5,000. Figure A14 does not plot the PM2.5 concentrations because the relatively inflexible
quadratic form proves to be a poor fit to the data.
   While the preceding analysis reports an aggregate EKC for the global economy, perhaps
most important are the results for China. Figure A2 reports that ambient levels of PM2.5
peaked in 2011. Emissions of CO2 , while increasing, have slowed considerably (figure A3).
Yet, as figure A4 reports, monetary damages increased 50% since 2011 and have averaged
an annual growth rate of 5%. These comparisons, for the world's second largest economy,
highlight the importance of an assessment of sustainability based on monetary damage rather
than physical units of pollution.


4.6    Sensitivity Analysis

Though by no means comprehensive, this sensitivity analysis covers the key parameters in
our GED and EVA calculations. We begin with an alternative VSL. In the default case, the
VSL for the U.S. is $7.4 million, we employ $2.8 million based on a review of contingent
valuation studies ((Kochi, Hubbell and Kramer, 2006). The procedures used to extrapolate
this value to countries other than the U.S. is identical to that employed in the default
case. Figure A15 indicates that this permutation attenuates the difference between EVA
and GDP growth rates. The sign of the difference is essentially unaffected. That is, the
U.S. and European economies exhibit positive growth differentials, while China and India
show predominantly negative growth spreads. Similarly, figure A16 indicates that the lower
VSL results in lower levels of pollution intensity. Figure A17 plots the relationships between
ambient PM2.5 , CO2 emissions, GED, and income. The results are consistent with figure
4. Namely, PM2.5 maximizes at low income levels, whereas GED and CO2 continue to rise.
And, the slope of the GED is considerably steeper than CO2 emissions.
   In the next set of assumptions, we adopt a value of the VSL-income elasticity of unity


                                             24
for all countries in all years. Figure A18 demonstrates that this change does not fundamen-
tally overturn the EVA-GDP growth differentials. The U.S. and European countries exhibit
positive and declining EVA-GDP growth spreads. We note however that in Germany after
2012, GDP exceeds EVA growth. The patterns in China and India are also quite similar to
the default case. Figure A19 indicates that, for China, the unit elastic assumption results
in a GED-to-GDP ratio of over 15% toward the end of the sample. Recall that under the
default assumptions, high income countries have a VSL-income elasticity of 0.8. Because real
incomes have generally increased in these countries, and the marginal damages for PM2.5 rise
more rapidly with an elasticity of 1, the high income economies exhibit slower declines in
pollution intensity in figure A19. Figure A20 shows that the effect of this change on the EKC
graphs is essentially to steepen the GED plot, which does not overturn our earlier conclusion
that the GED peak later than emissions.
    Finally, we employ a higher SCC applied to CO2 emissions. Figure A21 demonstrates
that this alternative appreciably affects the growth differentials in some of the eight largest
economies. For example, the EVA-GDP growth differential reaches -1% for China in 2004,
before rising rapidly back to nearly zero in 2012 and +0.5% in 2017. In India, the average
growth rate spread falls to -0.6% in 2010. In Germany and the U.K., the EVA-GDP difference
is larger than in the default case. Figure A22 shows that the higher SCC has a significant
effect on pollution intensity. The GED-to-GDP ratio tops 20% in China and nears 20% for
India late in the sample. Pollution intensity was around 15% in 1998 in Germany and the
U.K.. The effect on the EKC graphs is minimal (figure A23). Again, the GED plot steepens,
which supports the predictions of the conceptual model.



5     Conclusion

This analysis makes two contributions to the existing literature at the intersection of eco-
nomic growth and the environment. First, we offer an important extension to the Green



                                              25
Solow Model proposed by Brock and Taylor (2010). The augmentation consists of redefining
output to include environmental pollution damage. Prior papers in this space argue that
sustainability hinges on whether emissions are rising or falling at the balanced growth path.
In contrast, we contend that what matters for sustainability is whether damages are rising
or falling. This position reflects an argument traced back to definitions of sustainability
in the neoclassical growth and green accounting literatures; in order for an economy to be
growing sustainably, net savings growth (inclusive of natural and physical capital) must be
non-negative (Hamilton, 1994, 1996). Thus, since at the balanced growth path, net savings
growth is zero, damages must be non-positive to achieve sustainable growth. The consid-
eration of damage-based (rather than emission-based) sustainability is most critical when
emissions fall and damages continue to rise at the balanced growth path. In this case, envi-
ronmental policymakers focused on emissions would erroneously conclude an economy was
on a sustainable path.
   The paper also contributes the first globally-comprehensive set of environmental accounts
for two economically important pollutants over a 21 year time period. This exercise capital-
izes on a newly available database of ambient pollution readings along with a comprehensive
set of CO2 emissions data. The empirical analysis reports four key findings. First, high
income countries have been on a cleaning-up trajectory since 1998. Our key measure of
environmental performance, the GED-to-GDP ratio, fell among these countries from nearly
10% in 1998 to under 7% in 2018. Second, the upper-middle income group exhibited a sharp
rise in pollution intensity from over 7% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2018. We are careful to
note that the Chinese economy essentially drove this increase. Without China, these upper-
middle income countries exhibited very little growth in their damage-to-output ratios. Third,
pollution damages comprise the lowest share of output for nations in the lowest income class.
Damages remain at about 4% of GDP from 1998 to 2018. This level of pollution intensity
comprises about one-half of that in low-middle countries (which includes India). Fourth, our
empirical estimation of the EKC for physical emissions and concentrations, when contrasted


                                             26
to damages, provides firm empirical support for the predictions of the conceptual model. An
EKC fit to physical measures of pollution maximizes at lower income levels than one fit to
monetary damage. This, as argued above, has potentially critical implications for inferences
about society's sustainability. Most importantly, when we analyze emissions, concentrations,
and monetary damages in China, we find a case where one might draw such conflicting views
on its sustainability. Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 peaked in 2011. The rate of CO2
emission growth has also fallen recently. Yet, damages continue to rise, having gone up 50%
in real terms since 2011. China is a globally relevant case highlighting the salience of our
damage-based sustainability measure.
   The implications of revisions to national growth estimates are potentially broad and
far-reaching. Expectations about growth inform decisions made by central banks in setting
monetary policy, investors' choices regarding capital allocations, and, not least, consumer
sentiment. Adjustments to relative growth across countries has the potential to permute
capital flows, exchange rates, and ultimately, international relations such as multi-lateral
trade agreements. Thus, while our focus is on adjusting the traditional economic accounts
to recognize external pollution damages, we argue that the ramifications of doing so are,
indeed, fundamental to our estimates of growth and economic development.
