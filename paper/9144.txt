Household Demand for Employer-Based Health Insurance

NBER Working Paper No. 9144
September 2002

                                              ABSTRACT

    We use the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to estimate a model of household demand for
employer-based health insurance, explicitly investigating differences in behavior between households
with two potential sources of coverage and those with one source. Own and cross-price elasticities are
estimated for three types of health plans, including exclusive provider organizations, any provider
organizations, and mixed provider organizations. We find that the premium, family size, income, and
wealth significantly affect demand. Our elasticity estimates reveal an overall, small behavioral response
to changes in price with respect to health plan switching and take-up. Finally, we discuss the implications
of our findings with respect to employer benefit design.

I.        Introduction

           A key issue in health policy and health economics has been the question of the

uninsured. Over 43 million Americans are without health insurance coverage, and that

number has been growing over time (Rhoades et al, 2002, Hoffman and Schlobohm,

2000). There have been many proposals aimed at reducing the number of Americans

without health insurance. A prominent feature of many of these proposals is to offer

subsidies in the form of tax credits or vouchers for the purchase of health insurance.

How effective these policies may be depends critically on the price sensitivity of demand

for health insurance (Chernew et al, 1997, Blumberg et al, 2002). In addition,

employers’ policies towards health insurance offerings for their employees, particularly

the question of how much of premium costs employees should pay, are also critically

dependent on price sensitivity.

           In this paper, we take advantage of a new data resource, the 1996 Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), recently released by the U.S. Agency for Health Care

Research and Quality (AHRQ). This is a nationally representative comprehensive survey

of individuals and employers, and represents the most recent nationally representative

data on insurance offerings and individuals’ choices. Additionally, we explicitly

consider the choices of two-earner households. Due to dramatic increases in female labor

force participation, the majority of married households have two earners.2 As the

proportion of households with two earners rises, so does the proportion of households

with two potential sources of employer-based health insurance (EBHI) coverage. For


2
    In 1998 the Census Bureau reported that in approximately 60% of non-elderly families, both spouses were

employed (Casper and Bryson, 1998).



                                                                                                         2
many families, and particularly for those with two potential coverage sources, decisions

about whether to take up coverage and which plan or plans to choose are likely to be

made jointly by both workers in the household, rather than by an individual worker.3

           Last, few studies have been able to address the substitutability in demand of

different kinds of health insurance plans (e.g., conventional health insurance like Blue

Cross vs. HMOs). This information is important for benefit design by either government

or private employers. It is also critical for market definition and has been notably lacking

in some recent antitrust cases.4 By virtue of having employees’ full range of choices and

their characteristics in the data, we can recover this information.

           Thus, we use the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to estimate a

model of household demand for employer-based health insurance. This allows us to

identify the set of health plan and household attributes that influence decision-making,

explicitly investigating differences in behavior between households with two potential

sources of coverage and those with one source. We also estimate a set of own and cross-

price elasticities of demand for three types of health plans including exclusive provider

organizations (e.g., HMOs), mixed provider organizations (e.g., PPOs), and any provider

organizations (e.g., conventional fee-for-service plans).

3
    In related work, Abraham and Royalty (2002) find significant differences in the number and types of

employer-based plans available to two-earner families as compared to other households, suggesting the

importance of taking account of the full range of choices available when trying to understand how families

make decisions about their health insurance.

           In what follows, we first briefly survey the literature on health insurance demand

(Section II). We then describe our econometric approach in Section III. The data and

variable descriptions are contained in Section IV. Section V reports descriptive statistics

and the econometric results. Finally, Section VI contains discussion and concluding

remarks.

II.        Previous Literature

           The health insurance demand literature is large. 5 Many of the early studies,

including Juba et al (1980), McGuire (1981), Holmer (1984), Hershey et al (1984),

Welch (1986), Marquis and Phelps (1987), Long et al (1988), Short and Taylor (1989),

Taylor and Wilensky (1983), Farley and Wilensky (1984), Grazier (1986), Barringer and

Mitchell (1994) and Deb et al (1996), examine the decisions of workers among offered

plans, and find that factors including the price of coverage, cost-sharing provisions,

income, health status, and demographic characteristics affect health plan choice.6

           Focusing on decision-making within a managed care environment, Feldman et al

(1989) used data on 3,000 employees from 17 firms in Minneapolis to estimate a nested

logit model of health plan choice. They found price elasticities in the range of -.53 to

-.15 for a firm with a 50 percent market share. Other studies examining health plan

choice and switching behavior by university employees include Royalty and Solomon

5
    Scanlon (1997) and Morrisey (1992) provide excellent reviews.
6
    Feldstein (1973), Phelps (1976) and Goldstein and Pauly (1976) are the three earliest studies of health

insurance demand, but data limitations suggest caution with respect to interpretation of their empirical

results. Two other studies [Ellis (1989) and Marquis and Holmer (1996)] have also examined demand, but

used prospect theory rather that the more conventional expected utility theory to model the decision-

making process.



                                                                                                              4
(1999), Cutler and Reber (1998), and Buchmueller and Feldstein (1997). All three

studies found that employees, on average, were price-elastic with respect to their demand

for coverage.7,8

           To date, few studies have considered the influence of having two potential

sources of coverage on employee and household decision-making. Blumberg et al (2002)

use the 1996 MEPS to analyze a worker’s decision to take up any coverage. They found

that a worker was significantly less likely to take up coverage through her place of

employment if her spouse was also offered insurance at work. Additionally, they found a

small price elasticity between -.09 to -.01. Using earlier data from the 1987 National

Medical Expenditure Survey, Monheit et al (1999) investigated a household’s decision to

take up two policies that together provided “double coverage,” in which at least one

household member was covered under both policies. They found that the probability of a

household having double coverage was positively related to at least one policy having a

zero contribution requirement.

           Dranove et al (2000) argued that, given a greater proportion of households with

two-sources of coverage, employers would provide less generous coverage or require

higher contributions in order to encourage employees to take up coverage with their


7
    Royalty and Solomon (1999) estimate own-price elasticities between -.96 to –1.753. Cutler and Reber

(1998) find that a one percent increase in premium led to a two percent decrease in plan enrollment.

Buchmueller and Feldstein (1996) find that 26% of health plan enrollees will switch to a cheaper plan when

the monthly premium for their own plan rises by $10.
8
    One critique of these aforementioned studies is with respect to the generalizability of their results, given

that they use data from a single organization or geographic market.




                                                                                                                   5
spouse’s employer. They developed a theoretical model relating firm size, employee

contribution, and the tax subsidy associated with EBHI, and tested a set of predictions

using data from the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance

Survey. Their results suggest that employee contributions are higher when more

employees have working spouses and firms that have higher costs of insurance tend to

have disproportionately higher contributions.9

           This study extends the literature on four margins. First, we estimate a model

using a recent, national sample of households and their employers, providing variation in

premiums that is independent of plan characteristics. Second, by using the household as

the unit of analysis, we are able to identify a more complete picture of the choices faced

by household members and to control for household level factors that influence demand.

Third, we explicitly investigate potential differences in behavior between households

with two potential sources of coverage and those with one. Finally, after estimating own

and cross-price elasticities, we evaluate the potential impact of changes in employer

contributions or government subsidies on health plan switching, including the take-up of

health insurance coverage.

III.       Econometric Model

           We employ the random utility model of consumer choice (McFadden, 1974). We

presume that households maximize expected utility and that employment status is




9
    Gruber and McKnight (2002) estimate a model to examine the rise in employee contributions between

1982-1996. They find some empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that as an employee’s outside

options increase, including having coverage through a spouse, required contributions also rise.



                                                                                                        6
exogenous.10 Under well-known conditions, this allows us to recover households’

preference parameters by estimating the determinants of choice. We assume that the

errors in the model are additive and distributed i.i.d. Weibull, thus leading to a

multinomial logit specification. In what follows, we estimate the standard multinomial

logit model of consumer choice.11 Since the logit model can suffer from problems due to

the imposed assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), we also

estimate a nested logit specification and test for the violation of the IIA (Hausman, 1978).

           In the standard model of health insurance demand the key determinants of

household choice of health insurance plan (including no employer sponsored coverage)

are money and health (Cutler and Zeckhauser, 2000). Money consists of household

income net of health care expenses. These expenses may include an employee

contribution toward the total premium, as well as out-of-pocket spending, which depends

on the price of medical care and cost-sharing provisions of the chosen plan. Health state

depends on the medical care consumption of household members, demographic

10
     In this model we do not explicitly consider the intra-household decision-making process, which would

allow one to more clearly understand the aggregation of preferences across household members regarding

their coverage decisions.



11
     In multinomial logit models, recovering parameter estimates for attributes that do not vary across

alternatives (e.g., household characteristics) is achieved by interacting those factors with a set of indicator

variables corresponding to options in the choice set. However, because households’ choice sets vary in this

analysis, this would lead to too many parameters to estimate. We therefore employ an alternative approach.

Specifically, each household characteristic is interacted with three plan characteristics corresponding to

provider type, coverage type, and an indicator variable for the outside good (e.g., not taking up EBHI).

This accomplishes the same goal without suffering from the “curse of dimensionality.”



                                                                                                                  7
characteristics, and a random shock parameter that captures some loss of health by one or

more household members during the coverage period that can be restored at least

partially with medical care.

         When considering its coverage decision, the household must first identify the set

of available plan choices. We define a household’s choice set to consist of all

combinations of health plans offered to employed members, as well as the choice of not

taking up any employer-based coverage (“outside good”). The outside good

encompasses several possibilities, including public insurance, non-group coverage, and

choosing to go without insurance. For households with one source of employer provided

health insurance, the choice set consists of the set of k plans offered by the employer and

the outside good. The choice set is more complex for households with two-sources of

health insurance. It consists of k1*k2 possible combinations of coverage, where the

superscript denotes an employer source, as well as the outside good (not taking up

employer-provided coverage).



IV.        Data

A. Data Description

      We use two components of the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to

estimate the model (http://www.meps.ahrq.gov, 2002). The first is the Household

Component (HC), which is a random sample of the civilian non-institutionalized

population of the United States, containing individual level data on demographic

characteristics, employment status, health status, healthcare coverage, and medical care

utilization for 22,601 individuals in approximately 11,000 households. Our definition of




                                                                                             8
a household is based on the constructed Health Insurance Eligibility Unit (HIEU)

identifier contained in the data file. Specifically, an HIEU is a sub-family relationship

unit constructed to include adults plus those family members who would typically be

eligible for coverage under private family plans. These family members include spouses,

unmarried natural or adopted children who are age 18 or under, and children under age 24

who are full-time students.

       Household survey respondents who indicated that they were employed were asked for

contact information regarding their place of employment, as well as permission to contact

their employer. Employers of these household respondents were then surveyed and the

results were compiled into the MEPS Insurance Component (IC) database. For the

MEPS-IC, information was collected on up to four health plans for employees of private

establishments and all plans offered by public employers. Information was collected on

the total premium, employee contribution, plan type (exclusive provider organization,

mixed provider organization, any choice of provider organization), coinsurance,

deductibles, and covered benefits for plans that were both chosen and not chosen by the

employee.         Employers were also asked to verify employee eligibility and to confirm the

plan and coverage type held by the employee.

       While the data have substantial advantages over other sources, they suffer from one

key limitation. The sample of workers with complete information contained on the IC is

not nationally representative due to a high rate of non-response on the combined

surveys.12 Some workers refused to grant permission for the surveyors to contact their


12
     Due to this non-response, the MEPS-IC is considered a confidential database and is only available for use

at the CCFS Data Center of AHRQ in Washington, DC.



                                                                                                            9
employer, while others provided incomplete or inaccurate contact information.

Furthermore, some employers chose not to respond to certain items on the IC, which are

necessary for estimating models of health plan choice (e.g., confirming which plan was

held).

         Our study population includes households in which one or more members are

between the ages of 19 and 64, employed, and eligible to purchase employer-based

healthcare coverage. We classify households into two groups. The first consists of

households with one potential source of employer group coverage (“one-source”

households). These include single member households, married households in which

exactly one spouse is employed and eligible for coverage, and married households in

which there are two earners, but only one is eligible to purchase insurance. The second

group includes households with two workers who are both eligible to purchase coverage

(“two-source” households).

   After merging the data files and checking for missing information, the final sample

consists of 1,481 one-source households and 232 two-source households. A set of

descriptive statistics was tabulated to examine potential differences between those

households included in the final sample and those that were excluded due to incomplete

information. For the one-source households, those included in the final sample have

higher income, more serious medical conditions, and are more likely to have a federal

government worker in the household. No statistically significant differences were

identified for the two-source households.




                                                                                         10
B. Choice Sets

           Table 1 provides the distribution of the number of plans available to households

in the final sample. Of the 1,481 households with one source of coverage, approximately

55% have more than one plan from which to choose, and by definition all two-source

households have plan choice. In the decision-making process, households must also

select the type of coverage (e.g., single or family). This is an important consideration

since it not only affects who is covered but typically the required contribution too.

Therefore, we define each “option” in a one source household’s choice set to consist of

the combination of a particular plan and coverage type (e.g., Plan A-single coverage, Plan

A-family coverage) plus the outside good. For two-source households, the choice set is

more complex since it consists of all possible combinations of plan-coverage type options

belonging to each of the workers in the household plus the outside good. These

households may choose to take up coverage from neither, one, or both employer sources,

and/or may choose to take up plans with different combinations of coverage types such as

two single policies, one single and one family policy, or two family policies.13

C. Explanatory Variables

           Several household attributes may affect demand. The relevant price for analyzing

household behavior is the annual, employee contribution toward the total premium.14 For

13
     For this analysis, we assume that employment and healthcare coverage options are exogenous. In

particular, if workers sort into jobs or there is sorting within households based on particular preferences

regarding the trade-off between wage and non-wage benefits, this may bias the parameter estimates.
14
     The MEPS IC asks employers to report the contribution for an “average full-time employee,” which may

or may not accurately reflect what the particular household member would pay. However, through

discussions with MEPS surveyors, we have been informed that among establishments offering coverage to



                                                                                                              11
options that include two plans, we use the sum of the employee contributions for our

measure of price. We also include a set of interaction terms of the contribution with our

household attributes, which are described below. Health care plans vary in terms of their

cost-sharing provisions, such as coinsurance and deductibles. For one-source

households, we include a measure of the coinsurance rate and deductible for outpatient

care. For options that include two plans, average deductible and coinsurance measures

for the plans are specified.

        In recent years, growing dissatisfaction with limited provider access in managed

care plans has led to the development of new types of coverage that allow for greater

freedom of choice of providers. In the MEPS-IC, plans are classified into one of three

categories corresponding to provider organizational structure. These categories include

exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), any provider organizations (ANY), and

organizations that are a mixture of exclusive and any providers (MIX). These categories

are analogous to Health Maintenance Organizations, conventional fee-for-service plans,

and Preferred Provider Organizations or Point-of-Service plans, respectively. As a way

to capture households’ preferences for these products, we include a variable in the model

corresponding to an option having freedom of choice (FOC) of provider. This variable

combines the last two organizational structures above.

        To control for which household members are covered by a plan option, we specify

an indicator variable for family coverage in the one-source household specification.

Again, since two-source households may choose two plans, we use information on the



all workers, only a small percentage vary contribution requirements between full-time and part-time

workers who are offered insurance.



                                                                                                      12
number of household members and coverage type associated with each plan to construct

a variable for whether an option provides coverage for the entire household or only

partial household coverage.15            Finally, we include an indicator variable to identify the

outside good option in each household’s choice set.

           Several household characteristics are included. First, household size should

influence preferences regarding the selection of single or family coverage. Measured as a

binary variable, for one-source households it equals one if the household has a single

member, zero otherwise; for two-source households, it equals one if the household has

two members, zero otherwise.16 Since our one-source households are more

heterogeneous in terms of their demographic characteristics, we include a measure for

whether household members are married. And for both household types, we include the

number of children under the age of 18.

           Given the interrelated nature of medical care consumption and health insurance

demand, we include a measure of health status, defined as the number of serious medical

conditions per capita in the household.17 Poorer health may be positively associated with

taking up coverage, and potentially more comprehensive coverage in order to protect

against financial losses associated with anticipated medical expenses.




15
     Very few of our two-source households chose to take up options with partial coverage or no coverage

(outside good). As a result, these two categories were combined.
16
     Several household size measures were considered, including categorical and continuous versions. The

decision to use binary measures was based on the results of likelihood ratio tests.
17
     Possible medical conditions include stroke, cancer, heart disease, gall bladder disease, high blood

pressure, arteriosclerosis, rheumatism, emphysema, arthritis, and diabetes.



                                                                                                           13
         Income and wealth are also hypothesized to influence demand. Purchasing

insurance is consistent with having diminishing marginal utility of income and risk

aversion. Following Holmer (1984), we include the natural log of household wage

income. Without any direct measures of household wealth, we use tax filing status to

proxy for it. Our rationale is that households filing a 1040 form are more likely to have

investment income that requires them to do so (e.g., capital gains distributions). We

include an indicator variable to control for whether at least one individual in the

household is employed by the federal government. For these individuals, information on

their health plan options and contribution were coded directly by survey administrators,

rather than through the standard interview procedure used in data collection. Finally,

we interact each household characteristic with three indicator variables corresponding to

plan type, coverage type, and the outside good.

V.     Results

A. Descriptive Analysis

       Tables 2 and 3 provide summary statistics for the household and plan

characteristics. Two-source households are more likely to be married (1 vs. .48) and

have higher income ($62,684 vs. $38,186). One-source households face slightly higher

premium contributions on average for single coverage than do two-source households

($380 vs. $334), while there are smaller differences in family coverage contributions. In

our sample, approximately 41% of one-source households have access to a free (zero

premium contribution) single coverage plan and 21% have access to free family

coverage. An even greater percentage of two-source households have access, with 56%

and 29% having free single and family coverage options, respectively.

           For both household types, approximately 53% of available plans are EPOs, 38%

are MIX provider types, and eight percent of plans allow access to any provider.

However, if we more closely examine each household’s set of options, it is clear that

two-source households have a wider range of choices of plan types. For example, 44% of

our two-source households have both a managed care and a non-managed care plan from

which to choose, in contrast to only 18% of one-source households.

           Figures 1 and 2 show the coverage and plan types held by the one and two-source

households, respectively. For those households with one source of coverage, 91% take

up the offered coverage, with almost half choosing single coverage and the remaining

selecting family coverage. Of those holding coverage, 38% chose EPOs, 47% selected

plans with a mixture of exclusive and any providers, and the remaining selected any

provider plans. For two-source households, approximately 97% take up EBHI and, of

those, 56% select an option with two plans. For the subset holding two plans, nearly 68%

take up a combination of coverage that provides “double-coverage” for at least one

member of the family.

B. Model Estimates

           Tables 4 and 5 contain the multinomial logit model estimates.18 Among one-

source households, we find that those with higher income and more serious medical

18
     One methodological concern about the multinomial logit is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives

assumption. This assumption implies that unobserved variations in the characteristics of alternative choices

are independently distributed, such that the relative probability of choosing any option is independent of the

other choices available to the household. We also estimated nested logit models for both groups of

households. For one source households the nesting structure corresponded to choosing to take-up coverage

or not, and for two source households the nesting structure corresponded to selecting a plan with freedom



                                                                                                          15
conditions are more likely to take up employer-based coverage (less likely to choose the

outside good), while households with a federal government worker are less likely to do

so. Additionally, households that are married and those having more children are more

likely to choose family coverage, relative to single coverage. Regarding the type of plan

that households choose, both one and two-source households are less likely to enroll in

plans with a freedom of choice of provider, which is surprising, having controlled for

price differences.

         We find strong support for the effect of price on health plan choice: households

are less likely to choose plan options that have higher out-of-pocket contributions. Price-

sensitivity also varies with several household attributes. Married households, those with

children, and households that have a federal government worker exhibit a larger response

to price changes, while higher income households appear to be less sensitive to price.

For our two-source households, we find that wealthier households, as measured by our

1040 proxy, tend to be less price-sensitive.

C. Elasticity Estimates

         Table 6 presents three sets of elasticities to examine the magnitude of behavioral

responses exhibited by households to changes in the price of coverage. Own-price

elasticities are calculated to measure the extent of health plan switching within a

particular plan type (e.g., switching from one EPO plan to another EPO), while cross-

price elasticties measure the willingness to substitute from one type to another (e.g.,

switching from an EPO to a mixed provider plan). It is worth noting that the well-known



of choice of provider. The results from both models are qualitatively similar to our multinomial logit

results. The nested logit results are reported in the Appendix.



                                                                                                         16
result that elasticities in multinomial logit models depend only upon choice probabilities

and the price coefficient is true here only at the individual level: “market” own and cross

price elasticities depend also upon the distribution of household characteristics, which we

observe at the individual level. The third is an overall demand elasticity, which provides

a measure of choosing the outside good, in other words not taking up any employer-based

coverage, when contributions increase for all available plans.

           With health plan options varying by coverage type, plan type, and even the

number of plans, it is necessary to modify conventional interpretation methods. Rather

than estimating the magnitude of the effect in terms of changes in probability, our

calculation of elasticities is made in terms of changes in expected covered lives for EPOs,

mixed provider plans (MIX), any provider plans (ANY), and the outside good. For each

option in a household’s choice set, we calculated covered lives by allocating the number

of household members to each of the four categories above based on information about

plan type(s) and coverage type(s). For example, if a household has three members and

the option is an any provider plan with single coverage, then there are zero EPO covered

lives, zero MIX covered lives, one ANY covered life, and two outside good covered

lives.19 Expected covered lives were then calculated for each option by multiplying the

predicted probability of an option by the covered lives for each category, and then

summing over all of the options in the household’s choice set.

19
     For two-source household options including two plans, this is more complicated. For example, two

source households with options including two family coverage plans of different types had their members

split equally. So, for a household with three members, if the option contains an ANY plan with family

coverage and an EPO plan with family coverage, then there are 1.5 ANY covered lives, 1.5 EPO covered

lives, 0 MIX covered lives, and zero outside good covered lives.



                                                                                                        17
           Marginal effects were calculated discretely, given the presence of household

interactions with contribution and the complex nature of households’ options.20 Marginal

effects were computed for four different contribution increases: an increase in the

contribution of EPO plans; an increase in the contribution of ANY plans; an increase in

the contribution of MIX plans; and an increase in the contribution of all plans.

       In Table 6, the first set of estimates corresponds to the average behavioral response

for all households, while the second set represents the average behavioral response

exhibited by the subset of households having the particular plan types in their choice sets.

Own-price elasticity estimates range from -.13 to -.15 for any provider plans, -.13 to -.14

for EPOs, and -.19 to -.27 for mixed provider plans, while cross-price elasticity estimates

range from .02 to .32.         As expected, EPOs and mixed provider plans are perceived as

closer substitutes relative to any provider plans. Estimates of the average elasticity of

expected outside good covered lives with respect to the contribution suggests that raising

all plan contributions leads to a small decrease in the take-up rate by households. For

one-source households, we estimate this overall demand elasticity to be .21, which is

somewhat larger than what was found by Blumberg et al (2002).

           Overall, the results suggest that there would be a small behavioral response in

terms of switching within and across plan types associated with changing plan

contributions. The elasticities reported here are smaller in magnitude than estimates

found in other recent studies of health plan choice such as Royalty and Solomon (1999),

20
     To calculate the marginal effect of a change in contribution on expected covered lives, we increased the

contribution by $1, adjusting the values of all interaction terms in the model, re-computed the option

probabilities for every household, calculated new values for our expected covered lives, and took the

difference with the baseline expected covered lives to obtain the marginal effect.



                                                                                                           18
Cutler and Reber (1998) and Buchmueller and Feldstein (1997). One possible reason is

greater plan heterogeneity available to the households in our sample, as compared to the

aforementioned studies in which plan choices are more similar (e.g., all managed care

plans), and in some cases, have standardized benefit structures. Greater product

differentiation may provide a partial explanation for smaller price elasticities.

Additionally, there may be unobserved plan characteristics within households’ choice

sets that are correlated with the contribution, subsequently resulting in attenuation bias on

our price-sensitivity estimates (Berry et al, 1995). One example of omitted variables

could be perceived health plan quality, such as reputation or the size of the provider

panel.

VI.      Discussion and Concluding Remarks


A. Discussion

      While the own and cross-price elasticity estimates provide insights regarding how

changes in contribution affect switching between plan types, another concern of

employers pertains to the costs they bear with respect to subsidizing family coverage,

particularly when a worker has access to coverage through a spouse. Dranove et al

(2000) examine the issue of “employer competition” to be the employer not chosen to

sponsor coverage for a worker when he or she has another potential source. Results from

their analysis provide indirect evidence to support this form of “employer competition.”

While changing the benefits and increasing contribution requirements are two ways to




                                                                                          19
engage in this form of “competition”, another way is to establish an “opt-out” provision,

or cash payment to a worker who chooses not to take up any coverage.21

           From an employer’s perspective, the cost-effectiveness of offering an opt-out

provision depends on the extent to which employees switch from taking up coverage to

not taking up coverage, the amount of the payment, and the employer-portion of health

insurance costs. To be cost-effective, the savings generated from not having to pay the

employer portion of health insurance costs for those who opt out must be greater than the

new costs associated with the payments made to workers who choose not to take up

coverage.

           We estimate the cost-effectiveness of four different opt-out payments ($400,

$600, $800, and $1000) for the employers of the households in our sample using

information on the employer-portion of health insurance costs and the change in

probability of an employee taking up coverage with his or her own employer. A more

detailed explanation of the methodology can be found in the Appendix. For our two-

source households, the average baseline probability of a worker in the household

selecting an option that includes a plan sponsored by his or her own employer is .8.

Making a $1000 opt-out payment available to these workers leads to a reduction in the

average probability of taking up coverage of .19, or a 24% decrease in the take-up rate.

As expected, the effect is somewhat smaller for our households with only one source of

coverage. For this group, the probability of selecting an option that includes an

employer-sponsored plan is .89. Again, making the opt-out provision available leads to a


21
     In 1999, approximately 14% of all workers were employed in firms offering such a provision (Gabel et

al, 2000).



                                                                                                        20
15 point decrease in the probability of taking up coverage, or an approximate 17%

decline in the take-up rate.

       With information on the employer-portion of the total premium for each plan, we

also estimated how the average cost per employee for providing health care coverage

changes as a result of enacting this compensation policy. Table 7 reports the average

cost per employee under the four opt-out payment levels. We find that for employers of

both household types, establishing this provision can reduce employers’ costs, though we

find it to be more cost-effective for the employers of two-source households. For

example, if a $1000 opt-out payment is offered, we find that for employers of the one-

source households, their average cost per employee decreases $31 from $2,337 to $2,306,

whereas, for employers of the two-source households the average cost per employee falls

between $83 and $133. Relating these results back to the model proposed in Dranove et

al (2000), our findings provide direct evidence that opt-out provisions influence behavior

of workers with respect to taking up coverage and may serve to provide another method

by which employers compete to not be chosen when workers have an alternative source

of coverage.

B. Concluding Remarks

       In this study, we estimate a model of household demand for employer-based

health insurance using the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We find that factors

such as household income, wealth, family size, and having a household member

employed by the federal government all significantly affect health insurance demand.

Most notably, our empirical results suggest that households are less likely to choose a

plan option requiring a higher employee contribution, ceteris paribus.




                                                                                          21
       Demand elasticities reveal an overall, small behavioral response to changes in the

price of coverage as it relates to health plan switching and the decision to take up any

employer-based coverage. While we find no significant differences between households

with one source of coverage and those with two potential sources of coverage, we do find

that households with a second source of coverage are more likely to switch from taking-

up to not taking-up coverage from a particular employer source when offered alternative

compensation, such as an opt-out provision.

       Our results also have important policy implications. As policymakers consider

proposals to make health insurance more affordable to the uninsured through the use of

subsidies or tax credits, the effectiveness of these programs depends critically on whether

households will choose to take up coverage given these reductions in the price. What our

results suggest is that in order for such programs to have an impact on reducing the

number of uninsured, the tax credits or vouchers would have to be quite large.




                                                                                           22

Opt-Out Payment Exercise Methodology


Employer Benefit Design:

   (1) Switching

   ∆P = P N − P B
          J                  J
   P B = ∑ Pb, i and P N = ∑ Pn, i
          i                  i



   J options including plan(s) sponsored by employer

   PB: Baseline probability of choosing an option with a plan sponsored by employer

   PN: New probability of choosing an option with a plan sponsored by employer given

       the opt out payment

   Pb,i: Baseline probability of choosing option i in household’s choice set

   Pn,i: New probability of choosing option I in household’s choice set given opt out

   payment

   (2) Cost-Effectiveness of “opt out” provision: This is done by comparing the average

      cost per employee for health insurance before implementation of an “opt out”

      provision (ACB), to the average cost per employee after the provision is

      established (ACN).

   ACB: Baseline average cost per employee

   ECb: Baseline employer portion of total premium

   ECn: Baseline employer portion for plans, but opt out payment for “outside good”
