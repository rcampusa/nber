        A number of writers have recently questioned whether labor productivity or per capita

incomes were ever higher in the United Kingdom than in the United States. We show that although

the United States already had a substantial labor productivity lead in industry as early as 1840,

especially in manufacturing, labor productivity was broadly equal in the two countries in agriculture,

while the United Kingdom was ahead in services. Hence aggregate labor productivity was higher

in the United Kingdom, particularly since the United States had a larger share of the labor force in

low value-added agriculture. U.S. overtaking occurred decisively only during the 1890s, as labor

productivity pulled ahead in services and the share of agricultural employment declined

substantially. Labor force participation was lower in the United States, so that the United Kingdom’s

labor productivity advantage in the mid-nineteenth century translated into a larger per capita income

lead.

I. INTRODUCTION

A number of writers have recently questioned whether labor productivity and per

capita incomes were ever higher in the United Kingdom than in the United States

(Prados de la Escosura, 2000; Ward and Devereux, 2003). Although previous work by

Broadberry (1998) calculated sectoral differences in output per worker in the United

Kingdom and the United States from 1870 to 1990, and confirmed that US overtaking

occurred during the 1890s, this work was based on time series projections from a

1937 benchmark. That study was able to check the time series projections against a

sectoral benchmark for 1910, but no attempt was made to provide any additional

checks for the nineteenth century.



       This paper addresses more directly the issue of comparative productivity

levels in the United Kingdom and the United States during the nineteenth century, by

using time series projection from a 1910 benchmark, and using an 1850 benchmark as

an additional cross-check. We provide results for the period from 1910 back to 1840

for the overall economy together with a full three-sector breakdown for the period

1840-1910, based on agriculture, industry, and services, as well as a more detailed

breakdown of industry into manufacturing, mining and construction. However, due to

limitations in the pre-1870 data, we have provided a more detailed breakdown of

comparative productivity in the service sector into transport and public utilities,

distribution, other private services and government, only for the period 1870-1910.



       We show that although the United States already had a substantial labor

productivity lead in industry as early as 1840, especially in manufacturing, labor

productivity was broadly equal in the two countries in agriculture, while the United
                                           3

Kingdom was ahead in services. Hence aggregate labor productivity was higher in the

United Kingdom, particularly since the United States had a larger share of the labor

force in low value-added agriculture. U.S. overtaking occurred decisively only during

the 1890s, as labor productivity pulled ahead in services and the share of agricultural

employment declined substantially.



       In addition, the proportion of the population in the labor force was higher in

the United Kingdom than in the United States, reinforcing the U.K.’s per capita

income lead that resulted from its labor productivity advantage in the mid-nineteenth

century. The rise in the share of the population in the U.S. labor force after 1880, as

well as the improvement in overall labor productivity, enabled the United States to

attain per capita income leadership early in the twentieth century.



II. COMPARATIVE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, 1840-1910: DATA SOURCES

AND OVERVIEW

In this section we utilize time-series data on output and employment in the United

Kingdom and the United States to establish comparative productivity levels back to

circa 1840 by extrapolation from a circa 1910 benchmark. The sectors are agriculture

(farming, fishing, forestry), industry (mining, manufacturing and construction) and

services (including transportation and public utilities, distribution, finance and other

private services and government). The data are provided in Appendix 1, together with

detailed sources.



1. U.S. Time Series of Output and Employment
                                           4

Time series back to 1839 are readily available for the United States at a 10-year

frequency from Census and other sources. For the period 1869-1909, the standard

source is Kendrick (1961) for both output and employment. For the period 1839-1869,

Gallman (1960) drew on Census data to calculate real value added in agriculture and

industry, while Gallman and Weiss (1969) present data on service sector value added.

Following Johnston (2001), the sectoral labor force data prior to 1869 are taken

largely from Lebergott (1966), but incorporating a number of widely accepted

corrections suggested by Weiss (1975; 1986; 1992). These figures refer to “gainful

workers”, a broader definition than Kendrick’s (1961) concept of “persons engaged”.

Since gainful workers includes all persons who usually followed an occupation,

whether or not they were employed at the time of the Census, Lebergott’s total for

employment exceeds Kendrick’s at the splice point in 1869, although the sectoral

distribution is similar in both sources.



       When possible, we have cross checked the data with other sources. For

example, Davis’s (2004) new annual index of U.S. industrial production (starting in

1790) accords well with that of Frickey (1947) and the path of real output in

manufacturing suggested by Gallman (1960). We have also recalculated total output

as a weighted average of the sectoral outputs and total employment as the sum of

sectoral employments, to ensure that our use of additional information does not take

us too far from the original totals for output and employment presented in the standard

sources.



2. U.K. Time Series of Output and Employment
                                          5

For the United Kingdom, time series for output and the labor force by sector are

readily available at a 10-year frequency for the period 1861-1911 from Feinstein

(1972), and can be extended back to 1851 using Lewis (1978). The labor force data

are on broadly the same basis as those of Lebergott (1966) rather than Kendrick

(1961) for the United States. For the period 1841-1851, it is not possible to obtain

sectoral estimates for the United Kingdom, and attention has been confined to Great

Britain, excluding Ireland. This is potentially an important issue, since Ireland

accounted for 30.2 per cent of the United Kingdom’s population in 1841, falling to

23.8 per cent by 1851, after the Great Famine (Mitchell, 1988: 13). However,

although trends in output and employment were thus very different in Ireland and

Great Britain over this decade, it is likely that trends in productivity were far more

similar. Although the disarray arising from the famine may be expected to have had

an adverse effect on Irish productivity, there are also offsetting factors to consider.

First, the decline in agricultural employment resulted in much of the most marginal

land being taken out of production, hence boosting agricultural productivity in Ireland

(Boyer et al., 1994). Second, Geary (1998) points out that although there was a sharp

decline in the share of the Irish labor force employed in textiles between 1841 and

1851, this was offset to a large extent by an increase in the share employed in other

high-value-added manufacturing industries.



       Detailed sources for the United Kingdom are also given in Appendix 1. As

with the United States, we have recalculated total output for the United Kingdom as a

weighted average of the sectoral outputs and total employment as the sum of sectoral

employments, to ensure that our use of additional information does not take us too far

from the original totals for output and employment presented in the standard sources.

3. A benchmark for circa 1910

The starting point for the time series projection, which forms the basis of our central

results, is a benchmark estimate of comparative labor productivity by sector circa

1910. This has been published previously with a slightly different sectoral breakdown

in Broadberry (1997). For most sectors, the comparative labor productivity level is as

in the earlier study, but with the utilities (gas, electricity and water) now combined

with transport and communications to make up the transport & utilities sector.1

However, for the aggregate economy, a new estimate has been provided using the

geometric mean of comparative U.S./U.K. labor productivity using value added

weights for both countries and adjusting for (1) the different basis of the U.S. and

U.K. employment data and (2) the ownership of dwellings.



4. Comparative productivity levels by sector: an overview

Table 1 presents the main productivity comparisons. Strictly speaking, the dates of

comparison are 1839/41, 1849/51, etc., but we shall refer in the text to the central

dates of 1840, 1850, etc. The first three columns are the main sectors – agriculture,

industry, and services – followed by the economy-wide overall comparative labor

productivity. Not surprisingly, the story from 1870 to 1910 is essentially the same as

that in Broadberry (1998) and Broadberry and Ghosal (2002), with roughly equal

productivity in agriculture, much higher U.S. labor productivity in industry, and a

rapid catch-up in U.S. service sector productivity. The data again indicate that the

United States had caught up to the U.K. economy in aggregate labor productivity

around 1890 and exceeded it in the decades thereafter.

    The U.S. data do not permit separate estimates for the utilities before 1870.
                                           7




       What is new in Table 1 is the stability of the 1870 comparative productivity

levels in the three decades prior to that year. In the economy as a whole, comparative

labor productivity was about the same in 1840 as it was in 1870; i.e., the United States

had about 95 percent of the U.K. level of G.D.P. per person engaged. There was no

marked catch-up during the mid-nineteenth century; rather, the productivity gap

appears to have been small and stable. The overall pattern of sectoral productivity

performance seen in 1840 and 1850 was also roughly the same as it was in 1870, with

roughly equal productivity in agriculture, a large U.S. productivity advantage in

industry, and a large U.K. productivity advantage in services.



       Thus, in terms of overall labor productivity, the United States was about as far

behind the United Kingdom in 1840 as it had been in 1870, which is to say, not much.

The story that emerges is one in which the United States was close behind the United

Kingdom for much of the mid-century, only to catch up later largely as a result of a

convergence of productivity in services and a shift of the labor force away from

agriculture. The process of overall catch-up was not uniform throughout the century

as there is little evidence of such catch-up between about 1840 and 1880.



       Table 2 sets out the sectoral composition of the labor force in the two

countries, which sheds some light on how the comparative productivity levels in the

individual sectors aggregate to the overall comparative productivity levels in the final

column of Table 1. Clearly, agriculture was much more important in the United States

than in the United Kingdom. Since value added per worker was substantially lower in

agriculture than in industry or services in the United States, the concentration of such
                                               8

a large share of the labor force in agriculture helps to explain how G.D.P. per worker

was higher in the United Kingdom despite the substantial U.S. productivity lead in

industry.2 The proportional shift of labor out of agriculture in both countries also

helps to explain how the United States was able to catch-up with and eventually

overtake the United Kingdom. The falling share of labor in agriculture in the United

Kingdom was matched largely by a rising share of labor in services. In the United

States, however, there was also a substantial increase in the share of labor in industry.



III. SECTORAL ASPECTS OF COMPARATIVE PRODUCTIVITY, 1840-1910

1. Comparative productivity in agriculture

In agriculture, the stability of the relative productivity measure is a striking feature of

these figures. This implies that the timing of productivity improvements in agriculture

was broadly comparable in the two countries. In the United States, both our figures

and those of Weiss (1993) indicate that output per worker grew slightly but was

relatively unchanged before 1850, in line with the earlier estimates of Towne and

Rasmussen (1960). The slowness of agricultural productivity to increase can be

explained largely in terms of the westward movement of the frontier, expanding the

land area under cultivation without many capital investments taking place. However,

as Olmstead and Rhode (2002) point out, avoiding a decline in productivity should be

regarded as an achievement, since without substantial biological changes such as the

introduction of new varieties of wheat, yields would have fallen with the increasing

severity of insects, diseases and weeds.




2
 For example, U.S. G.D.P. per employee in 1849 was $285.5 for the whole economy but $168.3 in
agriculture (Gallman, 1960; Johnston, 2001).
                                           9

       After 1850, labor productivity began to increase more rapidly as

mechanization combined with further biological improvements (Parker and Klein,

1966; Olmstead and Rhode, 2002). However, developments in the South acted to

offset the gains in the North, with the emancipation of slaves reducing the intensity of

work and the breakdown of the plantation system leading to the loss of economies of

scale (Ransom and Sutch, 1977: 45; 74-75; Fogel and Engerman, 1974: 204).



       One point worth stressing is that the concept of labor productivity being

considered here is output per worker rather than output per hour. This is important

because as David (1996) notes, both the ratio of persons engaged to gainful workers

and the number of hours worked per person engaged were much lower in agriculture

than in the rest of the economy. Indeed, David (1996) calculates that the number of

full-time equivalent manhours per gainful worker in agriculture was little more than

half the level in the rest of the economy. This helps to explain the co-existence of

separate literatures emphasizing on the one hand how agriculture was a backward

sector from which surplus labor needed to be extracted to effect development and on

the other hand how land abundance in the United States led to labor shortages in

industry by creating a high opportunity cost for labor outside agriculture (Kuznets,

1966; Habakkuk, 1962). In the literature inspired by Kuznets (1966), U.S. agriculture

has low output per gainful worker, and the redeployment of labor away from

agriculture into industry helps to raise aggregate output per worker (Broadberry,

1998). However, in the literature inspired by Habbakuk, this is consistent with

agriculture having high output per hour worked, in line with the assumption of land

abundance (David, 1996).
                                                      10

           In the United Kingdom, agricultural labor productivity kept pace with

developments in the United States. After the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846,

agricultural output stagnated in the United Kingdom and the growing population was

fed increasingly through imports from abroad (Afton and Turner, 2000). As the

agricultural labor force declined, however, labor productivity continued to grow in

line with U.S. agriculture. The high and growing level of labor productivity in U.K.

agriculture throughout the nineteenth century can be understood in terms of (1) the

already low share of the labor force in agriculture during the Industrial Revolution

(Crafts, 1985) (2) increasing capital intensity during the “high farming” period or the

“golden age” between the 1840s and the 1870s (Beckett, 2000: 734-741) (3) the shift

of the product mix away from grain towards higher value added pastoral products

during the period of falling grain prices caused by the “grain invasion” from the

United States from the early 1870s (Ojala, 1952; Drescher, 1955; Turner, 2000).3



2. Comparative productivity in industry

Turning to industry, we build on the earlier findings of Broadberry (1994), who

examined U.S./U.K. comparative labor productivity levels in manufacturing in the

nineteenth century. The definition of industry in Table 1 includes mining and

construction, and is therefore broader than just manufacturing. However, a similar

pattern emerges, with a substantial U.S. labor productivity lead already established in

industry by the mid-nineteenth century.



           Table 3 presents a sectoral breakdown of the comparative productivity

position within industry, while Table 4 shows how the labor force was distributed

3
    In the U.K. literature, this period of falling prices from the mid-1870s to the mid-1890s is often
                                                    11

across the main industrial sectors. The largest industrial sector in both countries was

clearly manufacturing, and comparative labor productivity in this sector follows the

pattern analyzed in more detail in Broadberry (1994). Even as early as 1840, the

United States had a substantial labor productivity advantage over the United

Kingdom. Labor productivity in U.S. manufacturing was more than twice that in

British manufacturing in the 1840-1860 period, even higher than it was later in the

century. From 1870 through the end of the century, the U.S. productivity advantage

was nearly two-to-one.4



         This large U.S. labor productivity advantage in manufacturing during the

nineteenth century has attracted a great deal of attention since it was linked by

Habakkuk (1962) to the abundance of land and natural resources in the United States.

Habbakuk’s argument was that resource abundance led to labor scarcity and hence (1)

substitution of capital for labor in manufacturing and (2) labor saving technical

progress.5 The first result, of resource abundance leading to greater capital intensity

in manufacturing, goes through so long as there is a complementarity between capital

and resources, and this has been widely accepted in the recent literature (Ames and

Rosenberg, 1968). The second result of resource abundance leading to labor saving

technical progress has been demonstrated by David (1975), drawing on a model of


confusingly called the Great Depression (Orwin and Whetham, 1964: 240-288).
4
  The pre-1870 pattern of comparative labor productivity in manufacturing differs somewhat from that
reported in Broadberry (1994) largely on account of changes in the employment data for both
countries. For the United States, Lebergott’s (1966) data have been amended in line with Johnston
(2001), while for the United Kingdom the estimates of Lewis (1978) and Deane and Cole (1967) have
been preferred here to those of Mitchell (1988).
5
  Temin (1966; 1971) pointed out that these results are far from obvious in a standard neoclassical
model. In a standard model with two goods (agricultural and manufactured) and three factors
(resources, labor and capital), it is not obvious that resource abundance leads to greater capital intensity
in manufacturing, since both capital and labor are scarce. However, Krueger’s (1977) variation on this
model (allowing for an agricultural good and two or more manufactured goods) demonstrates that a
country with little capital may nonetheless produce quite capital-intensive manufactured goods if it is
also well endowed with land.
                                            12

endogenous localized technical change from Atkinson and Stiglitz (1968). These

effects are often seen as being reinforced by the greater homogeneity of demand in the

United States, allowing a greater degree of standardization and mechanization in the

production process.



       However, one difficulty remains the observation by Field (1985) that capital

intensity was not higher in the United States during the nineteenth century, even in

manufacturing. One possibility, suggested by Field, is to distinguish between overall

capital intensity and machine intensity, since most capital was in the form of

buildings. Another possibility, suggested by James and Skinner (1985), is to make a

distinction between skilled and unskilled manufacturing, with greater U.S. capital (or

machine) intensity only in the former. The distinction is based on the skill of the

workers; only in the skilled manufacturing sector were there sufficient incentives to

substitute capital (and resources) for labor.



       One problem with the James and Skinner (1985) formulation, however, is that

there is a large literature which sees the development of mass production from the

American system of manufactures during the second half of the nineteenth century as

saving on the use of skilled labor (Hounshell, 1984; Braverman, 1974). Broadberry

(1997a) uses the distinction between mass production and flexible production to

identify parallel approaches to accumulation on the two sides of the Atlantic. In U.S.

mass production, resource-using machinery was substituted for skilled craft labor to

produce standardized goods. Production was therefore more machine intensive and

more resource intensive, which suited U.S. factor supplies of abundant natural
                                           13

resources but scarce skilled labor. In the United Kingdom flexible production retained

a greater emphasis on customized production using skilled craft workers. This suited

the U.K. environment of abundant skilled labor but scarce natural resources. The two

technologies can be seen as developing in parallel, as in David’s (1975) model, and

this is consistent with a stationary comparative labor productivity ratio in

manufacturing as a whole over long time periods, so long as in the technologically

lagging country imitation is possible in some industries, and competition reduces the

size of industries where imitation is not possible.



       In mining, U.S. labor productivity was less than two-thirds of the U.K. level in

1840, but had caught up by 1870 and forged ahead after 1890. With labor productivity

growing only very slowly in U.K. mining before 1870 and declining slightly

thereafter, the overtaking resulted from rapid productivity growth in the United States.

The stagnant productivity performance in U.K. mining resulted largely from

diminishing returns in coal mining as the sector grew in response to a rapidly

expanding demand for energy. Although capital intensity increased and technical

progress occurred, they did little more than offset the tendency to diminishing returns

as pits became deeper and more difficult seams were mined (Taylor, 1961; Walters,

1975; Church, 1986: 471-496). The timing of productivity growth in the United States

was not uniform, however, with a large jump in the 1860s and another surge during

the 1890s. The first productivity jump may be related to the effects of the California

gold rush in 1849 and the subsequent expansion of gold, silver, and copper mining in

the western United States. The second productivity advance is probably related to the

opening of the vast Lake Superior iron ore ranges (near the Great Lakes) in the late

1880s and early 1890s (Herfindahl 1966).
                                           14




        These developments in mining were an important factor in shaping U.S.

comparative advantage in international trade during this period. Wright (1990)

demonstrates that U.S. net exports were natural resource intensive from the 1870s

through the 1920s. Irwin (2003) argues that the opening of the Mesabi iron ore range

led to a sharp decline in the relative price of U.S. exports of iron and steel products,

thus propelling a rapid expansion of those exports. In his account, this helped shift the

United States from a net importer to a net exporter of manufactured goods for the first

time in its history.



        In construction, U.S. labor productivity was little more than half that in the

United Kingdom in 1840, but was slightly above the U.K. level in 1890. However, the

U.S. trend improvement in construction was much more cyclical than in mining.

Indeed, as noted in Broadberry (1997), there appears to be a long swing pattern to

comparative productivity in construction, with periods of boom in the U.S. building

industry coinciding with periods of slump in the U.K. building industry. This pattern

was first identified by Thomas (1954), and although the indicators of building activity

in the two countries have been improved substantially since this work, the inverse

cyclical pattern is still visible in the revised data series. The small scale of the U.S.

productivity advantage in construction on the eve of World War I, compared with the

position in manufacturing, suggests that there were limitations to the possibility of

adopting high throughput methods in this sector to offset the higher wages in

America. Indeed, construction was the one industrial sector in the United States where

the apprenticeship system for training skilled craft workers remained important into

the twentieth century (Bolino, 1989).
                                          15




       However dramatic was the improvement in comparative U.S. productivity in

mining and construction, these sectors were a relatively small part of the overall U.S.

overtaking of the United Kingdom because the share of the labor force employed in

mining and construction remained small in both countries, reaching a peak of 8.1 per

cent in the United States and 11.4 per cent in the United Kingdom in 1909/11 (Table

4).



3. Comparative productivity in services

Table 5 examines comparative productivity in the service sector in more detail, while

Table 6 presents data on the employment shares of. As noted earlier, data limitations

prevent a reliable breakdown of comparative productivity levels within services for

the period before 1870. However, we still believe that the data are adequate to

establish the finding that labor productivity in the service sector as a whole was

substantially higher in the United Kingdom than in the United States during the period

1840-1870. After the Civil War, however, U.S. productivity performance improved

rapidly in services, catching-up to U.K. levels during the 1870s, and pulling ahead

decisively during the 1890s.



       Broadberry and Ghosal (2002) link the U.S. overtaking in services to the

application of high-volume, low-margin methods to services, beginning on the

railroads, and moving on rapidly to other parts of the transport and utilities sector,

with the establishment of steamship lines, urban traction systems and the telegraph

and telephone systems (Chandler, 1977: 189-203). This resulted in U.S. overtaking in
                                           16

transport and the utilities by 1880, and the establishment by World War I of a

productivity lead in this sector on a scale similar to that in manufacturing.



       In the distribution sector, although there was a move in the direction of high

volume business with the emergence of department stores, chain stores and mail-order

houses, demand factors limited the diffusion of modern business enterprise. In

particular, there were limits to the degree of centralization and standardization that

consumers were prepared to accept, particularly given the relatively low levels of

population density in the United States compared with the United Kingdom (Field,

1996: 25-27).



       In other private services, such as banking and finance, there were obvious

difficulties in adopting a high-volume, impersonal, standardized approach, given the

importance of asymmetric information and trust (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981;

Lamoreaux, 1994). The United Kingdom retained a clear advantage in this sector until

World War I. The scale of U.K. employment in this sector was relatively large, but to

the extent that this generated economies of scale, they must be seen as external

economies. For the late nineteenth century, Cassis (1994) paints a convincing picture

of the City of London as a “Marshallian district”, reaping external economies of scale

through a network of small financial institutions.



       Although government was a small part of the economy, and poses particularly

severe measurement problems, it is included here for the sake of completeness.

Feinstein (1972) and Lewis (1978) measure real output in this sector by assuming an

increase in labor productivity of 0.5 per cent per annum in civil administration, but
                                           17

not the military. This is justified on the grounds of the growing introduction of office

machinery (Lewis, 1978: 264). Since in both countries output moves in line with

employment, the equivalent assumption in a cross-country comparison, that

comparative output varies in line with comparative employment, yields equal labor

productivity in the two countries by construction. The small deviations from 100 in

Table 5 reflect the relative importance of the military, particularly around the Boer

War.



IV. SOME CROSS CHECKS

1. A benchmark check for 1850

Since our estimates of comparative productivity involve projection with time series

from a benchmark for 1910, it will be useful to construct an independent benchmark

estimate for 1850, to act as a cross check. For the United States and Great Britain, it is

relatively straightforward to compile the estimates of nominal G.D.P per employee

from the sources used to construct our time series of real output and employment by

sector, and these are provided for the whole economy, together with the three-sector

breakdown in Table 7. The most difficult part is to obtain a price ratio to compare the

U.S. estimates in dollars with the British estimates in pounds sterling. Our simple

procedure here is to construct a P.P.P. for the whole economy on the basis of the

wholesale prices of five commodities, covering wheat, raw cotton, cotton cloth, raw

wool and coal. Using this P.P.P., we obtain an estimate of the U.S./G.B. comparative

productivity ratio of 95.7, which is reassuringly close to the figure of 89.9 obtained by

time series projection in Table 1.
                                          18

       However, as noted earlier, it is important to take account of the difference

between Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, in part B of Table 7 we

also provide an estimate of the U.S./U.K. comparative G.N.P. per head ratio in 1850

using the P.P.P of £1 = $5.33. This yields a lower U.S./U.K ratio of 78.4, largely on

account of the much lower labor force participation rate in the United States, an issue

which we investigate further below.



       The P.P.P used in the above calculations is clearly far from ideal, and we

would agree with the appeals of Ward and Devereux (2003) and Prados de la

Escosura (2000) for more work on international comparisons of price levels in

history. However, it is also important to avoid the inconsistent use of new price

evidence by these authors, as highlighted by Broadberry (2003). To a large extent, the

value of nominal G.D.P in historical national accounts is obtained by reflating volume

indicators using limited price information. If the price information set is expanded, it

is appropriate to calculate new estimates of nominal G.D.P. It is incorrect to leave the

nominal value of G.D.P unchanged and to use the new price information to derive

different estimates of real G.D.P.



       What we are able to show in Table 8 is that the P.P.P.s calculated every

decade between 1840 and 1913 from the basic price information on these five

commodities tracks quite closely the implied P.P.P from time series projections for

the entire period. This means that the price information being used in our circa 1850

benchmark is at least consistent with the price indices that have been used to

reconstruct the nominal values of G.D.P. in the historical national accounts for these

two countries.

2. Population, labor and comparative per capita incomes

Our estimates have been concerned primarily with output per worker. However, the

claims in the recent literature of U.S. superiority in the mid-nineteenth century have

typically been couched in terms of higher levels of G.D.P. per capita. Thus Ward and

Devereux (2003) suggest higher per capita income in the United States in 1872, while

Prados de la Escosura (2000) shows the United States ahead as early as 1820. In fact,

given the substantially higher share of the population in the labor force in the United

Kingdom, shown here in Table 9, a small U.S. per capita income lead would imply

that the United States maintained a very large lead in labor productivity. These

authors do not provide evidence of such a lead.



       Indeed, since our estimates show a very small U.K. labor productivity lead

between 1840 and 1880, the higher proportion of the population in the labor force in

the United Kingdom translates into a rather more substantial lead in per capita income

terms, as can be seen in the fourth column of Table 9. Thus, the United States

overtook the Untied Kingdom in overall labor productivity by 1890, but did not

overtake in per capita income until 1910.6



       The lower share of the population in the labor force in the United States during

the nineteenth century can be explained at least in part by demographic factors. The

median age of the population was substantially lower in the United States than in he

United Kingdom, where an earlier fall in fertility led to an earlier fall in the child

dependency rate (Easterlin, 1972: 141). Whilst U.S. fertility also declined in the later
                                                 20

nineteenth century, the child dependency rate remained markedly higher and the

proportion of the population in the labor force correspondingly lower in the United

States than in the United Kingdom on the eve of World War I.7



V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper has revisited the issue of comparative labor productivity between the

United Kingdom and the United States in the late nineteenth century, and linked it to

relative per capita incomes in the two countries. Building on the earlier work of

Broadberry (1998), we push back the sectoral productivity estimates from 1870 to

1840 and provide another cross check on the results by using an 1850 benchmark in

addition to the 1910 benchmark. We find that U.S. labor productivity was about 95

percent of that of the United Kingdom in 1840, about the same as it was in 1870. The

United States already had a substantial labor productivity advantage in industry,

particularly manufacturing, roughly comparable productivity in agriculture, and lower

productivity in services. The United States overtook the United Kingdom in per capita

income after the turn of the century as a result of shifting labor out of agriculture,

raising its productivity in the service sector, and increasing the share of the population

in the labor force.

  These estimates are close to those of Maddison (2003: Tables 1c and 2c) for adjacent years, despite
the use of slightly different time series for our output based estimates.

  Figures from Feinstein (1972: Tables 55-56) and the U.S. Department of Commerce (1975: Series
A119-134) show that in circa 1910, 30.6 per cent of the population was under the age of 15 in the
United Kingdom, compared with 32.1 per cent in the United States. The corresponding figures for 1860
were 35.0 per cent in the United Kingdom and 40.6 per cent in the United States.

APPENDIX 1: DATA FOR TIME SERIES PROJECTIONS, 1840-1910

1. United States
General sources for output by sector
1869-1909: Kendrick (1961: Table A-IV).
1839-1869: Gallman (1960: Table A-1).

General sources for employment by sector
1869-1909: Kendrick (1961: Table A-VII).
1839-1869: Johnston (2001: Table A-1). The basic data from Lebergott (1966: Table
1) have been adjusted in line with the later estimates of Weiss (1967; 1986; 1992).

Additional sources and notes for specific sectors
Agriculture: Output 1839-1869 is for narrowly defined output, excluding land
improvements and home manufactures, for reasons of comparability with the U.K.
Output 1869-1909 is gross output, farm segment, from Kendrick (1961: Table B-II).
Manufacturing: Output 1859-1869 from Frickey (1947: 54) and Davis (2004: Table
3).
Transport & utilities: Output 1839-1869 is value added in current prices from
Gallman and Weiss (1967: Table A-1), deflated using a weighted average of shipping
freight rates from North (1960) and Simon (1960), and railway freight rates and
passenger rates from Fishlow (1966).
Distribution: Output 1839-1869 is value added in current prices from Gallman and
Weiss (1967: Table A-1) deflated using a price deflator for distribution from Gallman
and Weiss (1967: Table 3).
Other private services: Output 1839-1869 is value added in current prices from
Gallman and Weiss (1967: Table A-1), deflated using a price deflator for services
(variant 1) from Gallman and Weiss (1967: Table 3). Hand trades and shelter
excluded.
Government: Output 1839-1909 derived from employment with assumption of labor
productivity growth at 0.5 per cent per annum.

2. United Kingdom

1861-1911: Feinstein (1972: Table 8).
1851-1861: Lewis (1978: Table A.3).
1841-1851: Hoffman (1965: Table 54B).

General sources for employment by sector
1861-1911: Feinstein (1972: Table 60).
1851-1861: Lewis (1978: Table A.4).
1841-1851: Deane and Cole (1967: Table 31).

Additional sources for specific sectors
Agriculture: Output 1841-1851 derived from volume indicators from John (1989),
with arable and animal husbandry weights for 1846 from p.1046.
Construction: Output 1861-1911 is an unpublished revised index kindly made
available by Charles Feinstein and Andrew Hilditch.
Transport & utilities: Output 1841-1851 is an extension of the Lewis (1978) method
using railways and shipping data from Hawke (1970) and Mitchell (1988).
                                        27

Distribution: Output 1841-1851 is an extension of the Lewis (1978) method using
data on agriculture, mining and manufacturing output plus imports and re-exports.
Other private services: Output 1841-1851 is nominal value added from Deane and
Cole (1967) deflated by the Rousseaux price index for all items from Mitchell (1988:
722-723).
Government: Output 1841-1861 is derived from employment with an assumption of
labor productivity growth at 0.5 per cent per annum.
