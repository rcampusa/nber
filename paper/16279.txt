This study investigates the role of social networks in aligning the incentives of economic agents in
settings with incomplete contracts. We study the New York City taxi industry where taxis are often
leased and lessee-drivers have worse driving outcomes than owner-drivers as a result of a moral hazard
associated with incomplete leasing contracts. Using instrumental variables and fixed-effects analyses,
we find that: (1) drivers leasing from members of their country-of-birth community exhibit significantly
reduced effects of moral hazard; (2) network effects appear to operate primarily via social sanctions;
and (3) network benefits can help to explain the organization of the industry in terms of which drivers
and owners form business relationships.

        When an economic agent does not bear the full cost or full fruit of her actions, a moral

hazard may arise in which the agent, through doing what is personally optimal, behaves in ways

that are sub-optimal from a social standpoint (Holmstrom 1979). Moral hazard plays a central

role in our understanding of numerous contractual relationships and researchers have found

evidence consistent with moral hazard in many contexts.1 The standard approach to alleviating

moral hazard is to use contracts that align the incentives of the agent and principal; for example,

paying workers in stock options to induce them to care about the welfare of the company or

requiring collateral to reduce borrowers' incentives to default. However, in many settings, such

as those with poor access to collateral, such options are not available.

        The use of contracts that exploit social ties, within which monitoring costs are low and

members can apply social sanctions on each other, has been proposed as a way to enhance the

willingness of individuals to act in the interest of the broader society (Stiglitz 1990). However,

Banerjee, Besley, and Guinnane (1994), Besley and Coate (1995), and Wydick (1996) argue that

a sufficient strong and credible threat of social sanctions against a defaulting group member may

be necessary to deter moral hazard in a credit contract, suggesting that it is the strength of group

pressure against potential defaulters that matters rather than social ties per se. Karlan, Mobius,

Rosenblat, and Szeidl (2009) model network connections between individuals as generating

"social collateral" that facilitates secure informal borrowing and they document that network

strength predicts informal borrowing in Peru. In their model, the possibility of losing valuable

friendships secures informal transactions the same way that the possibility of losing physical

  For example, worker effort and productivity are higher when workers are paid by a piece rate versus an hourly
wage (Foster and Rosenzweig 1994, Lazear 2000), farm field work may be mechanized when supervisory
monitoring costs of workers are high (Smith 1986), and make-versus-buy patterns in the trucking industry may
reflect an inability of firms to ensure the efficient use of their resources (Baker and Hubbard 2003, 2004).

                                                                                                                  2
collateral can secure formal lending. Altruism between group members has also been identified

as a nonmarket channel through which incentives are aligned (Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993).

        Virtually all the empirical evidence that social ties might mitigate moral hazard is in the

group-lending context in developing countries (where markets are not well defined, credit is

constrained, and property rights are not well enforced). Moreover this evidence is mixed.2,3

Given the central role that moral hazard plays in explaining the structure of contracts in various

domains, and a theoretical literature highlighting that contractual arrangements that exploit social

ties might mitigate moral hazard, it is important to provide empirical evidence on these issues in

a developed nation context, in a well defined market, and outside of the microcredit context. As

such, we aim to extend the scope of the empirical literature on the importance of social ties in

mitigating moral hazard by presenting the first clean evidence that social ties reduce moral

hazard in a labor market setting in the United States. Specifically, we analyze the outcomes of

New York City taxi drivers who lease (as opposed to own) their taxis and compare the outcomes

of those who lease from an owner from the same country of birth to the outcomes of those who

lease from an owner from a different country of birth.

        The taxi leasing market is a prime candidate for studying moral hazard because lessee-

drivers pay less or none of many of the variable costs they generate, including vehicle


2
  To our knowledge, the only empirical studies on the ability of social networks to reduce moral hazard outside of
group lending are Greif (1993), who finds that community enforcement was effective at limiting moral hazard in
11th-century Mediterranean trade; and Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul (2005, 2009), who find that social connections
lead to a misallocation of effort and hence lower productivity among college student fruit pickers. Gil and Hartmann
(2011) provide evidence on market organization through social networks in response to moral hazard, which we
discuss later in the section.
3
  This ability of social ties to reduce moral hazard is argued to be largely responsible for the success of group-
lending banks such as the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh (Pitt and Khandker 1998 and Banerjee, Duflo, Glennerster,
and Kinnan 2009). Kandori (1992) and Ellison (1994) study theoretically how community enforcement may operate,
while Sharma and Zeller (1997), Karlan (2007), and Ahlin and Townsend (2007) provide additional empirical
evidence about how social ties operate in group-lending, though Giné and Karlan (2006, 2009) find no benefit to
group versus individual lending. Social interactions have been identified as determinants of economic actions in
other contexts as well (for example, Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan 2000, Glaeser, Liabson, Scheinkman, and
Soutter 2000, Duflo and Saez 2003, Karlan 2005, Mas and Moretti 2009, and Jackson and Bruegmann 2009).

                                                                                                                  3
maintenance, repair, replacement, and insurance, and hence have incentives to choose inefficient

levels of vehicle usage, care, and risk. The heart of the problem is that a lessee-driver’s driving

style cannot be monitored at reasonable cost, and hence the ability to specify in the leasing

contract the driver’s level of vehicle care is limited.4

        As a result of these contracting limitations, Schneider (2010) finds significantly higher

rates of accidents and driving violations for lessee-drivers versus drivers who own their taxis due

to moral hazard. The NYC taxi driver labor market is also uniquely well suited for the study of

social ties because most NYC taxi owners and drivers are immigrants to the United States, with

owners representing 112 countries and drivers representing 146 countries, which allows us to

compare outcomes both within and across numerous country-of-birth social networks.

        To present some of the first evidence that social ties can mitigate the effects of moral

hazard in a labor market and developed country setting we compare the driving outcomes of

drivers who lease from owners from the same country of birth (in-network) to the driving

outcomes of drivers who lease from owners from a different country of birth (out-of-network).

We use country of birth as our measure of social connectedness because this has been found to

be an important social connection in other contexts. For example, country-of-birth networks have

been found to be important for immigrant assimilation (Borjas 2000) and job seeking (Munshi

2003, Edin, Fredriksson, and Aslund 2003).5

        To guide the interpretation of the empirical results, we lay out the theoretical reasons why

the outcomes of in-network versus out-of-network drivers may vary: first, owners may be better

positioned to identify and hire high ability drivers when they are in-network; second, in-network



4
 Drivers however keep all fare revenue so effort to generate fares for the owner is not relevant in this context.

 Granoveter (1974), Montgomery (1991), Fernandez and Weinberg (1997), and Pellizzari (2004) are other studies
on the role of social networks in employment search.

                                                                                                                    4
drivers may exert more effort in their driving style to limit the costs borne by the owner. These

effort effects could be due to several factors, including social sanctions, social collateral, social

preferences, or a better ability of owners to monitor drivers. To formalize these notions, we

present a search model connecting owners to drivers that gives the following empirical

predictions: (a) in the presence of either better screening or higher effort for in-network drivers,

in-network driving may be prevalent; (b) there is positive/negative selection of drivers into in-

network driving based on their ability if the results are driven by screening/effort effects; and (c)

in the presence/absence of effort effects there exists a positive/no relationship between in-

network driving and driving outcomes (after taking selection on ability into account).6

         The empirical difficulty in isolating the causal (effort) effect of in-network driving is that

in-network drivers may differ from out-of-network drivers in important unobserved ways.

Because this paper is not based on experimental variation our approach is not to provide one

single estimate of the causal effect from a single research design, but to present a compelling

body of evidence based on three credible but imperfect research designs that rely on distinct

sources of variation and rely on different identifying assumptions.

         Our first approach is to aggregate the data to the country-of-birth level to compare the

outcomes of drivers from countries with high rates of in-network driving to drivers from

countries with low rates of in-network driving ─ removing any bias due to selection within a

network; that is, selection that leads one driver to lease in-network and another to lease out-of-

network from the same country of birth. Our second strategy exploits longitudinal data to

compare the change in outcomes of drivers who switch from driving in-network to out-of

network (and vice versa) over time to the outcomes of drivers who always drive in-network or


6
 Note that we use the term ability broadly to indicate intrinsic driver characteristics that affect the driving outcomes
of interest. These characteristics include motor skills and also factors such as conscientiousness.

                                                                                                                       5
never drive in-network over the same time period ─ removing any bias due to high ability drivers

being more or less likely to lease in-network. Our third strategy exploits cross-sectional variation

in the residential locations of drivers relative to owners from the same country of birth. Under the

assumption that the distance from a driver’s residence to the nearest same-country owner’s

residence is unrelated to underlying driver ability (an assumption for which we present empirical

support), we use this distance measure as an exogenous instrument for driving in-network while

also conditioning on the place-of birth-network. That is, we compare the outcomes of drivers

who lease in-network because they live close to an in-network owner to those of drivers who

lease out-of-network because they do not live close to an in-network owner.

       Although none of these research designs is dispositive, the combination of evidence is

compelling because these estimation strategies control for and are subject to different sources of

bias. Specifically, if our effects are driven by selection within a place-of-birth network, they

would disappear once we aggregate to the place-of-birth level to rely exclusively on variation

across place-of-birth networks. However, if the results are driven by selection across place-of-

birth networks (which would bias our aggregate results), then they would disappear in models

that condition on the place-of-birth network of the driver. Also, if the results are driven by

sample selection or survivorship bias (which would bias the aggregate results) then they would

disappear in models that use within-driver variation. Finally, if the results are driven by changes

in driver ability that co-vary with changes in in-network driving status (which would bias the

within-driver estimates), then the results would disappear in the instrumental variables and the

country-level models. As such, while each strategy individually may be subject to some form of

selection bias, it is highly implausible that all three sources of variation are. Therefore, consistent




                                                                                                      6
results across these methodologies would indicate a real causal effect. We additionally provide

supporting robustness checks related to all of these approaches.

        We first find that, consistent with there being an important benefit to driving in-network,

in-network driving is much more common than would be expected by random chance, and

cannot be explained by residential clustering by country of birth. That is, the patterns are

consistent with the taxi industry organizing around social networks to mitigate agency problems.

We then find that across all three strategies that account for selection, drivers have better

outcomes when driving in-network versus out-of-network ─ indicative of a real causal effort

effect. Our naive OLS estimates are smaller than in all three models that account for selection,

indicating negative selection into in-network driving as predicted by the theoretical model under

effort effects and inconsistent with the model under screening. To provide further evidence that

our effects operate through the mitigation of moral hazard, we split out in-network effects by

summons type and find the largest effects for types directly affecting owners’ costs (as opposed

to drivers' costs which would be internalized by the driver).This provides further support that

selection is not driving our results.

        Finally, given the large apparent effort effects, we investigate the likely mechanisms at

play. We use as a measure of owner/driver network strength the density of residents in the

owner’s/driver’s immediate neighborhood from the same country of birth, and find that the

marginal effects of driving in-network increase with the strength of the owner’s network but not

the driver’s network, and that in-network effects are weak when the owner’s network strength is

weak. These patterns are consistent with the presence of social sanctions in the form of

community-enforced punishments, which would likely emanate from the owner’s and not the

driver’s network, but inconsistent with altruism, which should operate independently of the



                                                                                                    7
owner’s network.

       Our results support the findings in Gil and Hartmann (2011) who also show that markets

may organize around common-origin communities to mitigate agency problems. Our study

improves upon Gil and Hartmann by examining richer data for identifying market organization,

and also by providing evidence directly that social networks reduce moral hazard. That is, we

actually observe important benefits to organizing around social networks.

       More generally, this paper adds breadth to the literature on social networks and moral

hazard by being the first study (to our knowledge) to show directly the potential of social

networks to reduce moral hazard in a labor market context and in a developed nation. Also given

that the micro-credit literature is mixed, this study contributes to this literature by providing

compelling evidence that social networks can reduce moral hazard. The current results are

particularly interesting because the New York City taxi industry offers a practical alternative to

taxi leasing that alleviates most of the moral hazard problem: An active credit market exists in

which specialized lenders specifically market loans to taxi drivers to buy their own vehicles.

Thus, even in a setting in which credit is available, transactions are commonplace among

members of the same country network, indicating that social networks significantly reduce the

cost of using the market. We can infer that social networks would be even more valuable if

contracting alternatives were not available.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives background on the New York

City taxi industry. Section 3 describes the data. Sections 4 and 5 provide the theoretical and

empirical frameworks that underlie our analysis. Section 6 describes the main results. Section 7

examines how social ties may operate in the current context. Section 8 concludes.

                            2. THE NEW YORK CITY TAXI INDUSTRY

Licenses and driving arrangements

        To operate a taxi in New York City, a driver must possess a taxi license (often called a

medallion).7 There are two types of taxi licenses: An "owner-must-drive" license, which requires

the license owner to be a full-time driver (specifically, to drive at least 210 shifts of at least nine

hours per year); and a corporate license, which is free of owner-driving requirements and

typically is owned by corporations that lease the licenses (often with vehicles) to drivers. The

two license type are immutable. Except in rare instances, new licenses have not been issued since

the 1930s, leading to an active trade in the existing licenses between private parties for hundreds

of thousands of dollars each.

        Under this licensing structure, drivers can operate in three ways: Owner-driving, in which

the driver owns the license and vehicle; driver-owned-vehicle-driving (DOV-driving), in which

the driver leases the license but owns the vehicle; and lessee-driving, in which the driver leases

both the license and vehicle. Lessee-drivers can operate under either long-term leases, which

typically extend for six months at a time, or short-term leases, which are twelve hours long.

Taxis are typically operated by two drivers for two shifts per day (a day and night shift). Thus, a

taxi is typically operated by two lessee-drivers, two owner-drivers who co-own the taxi, or one

owner-driver and one lessee-driver who leases from this owner-driver.

        For reasons explained below, the drivers we examine are primarily lessee-drivers

operating under this third type of driving arrangement, where the owner-driver operates the taxi

for one shift twelve-hour shift per day and a lessee-driver who leases the taxi (both the license

and vehicle) from the owner-driver operates the taxis for the second twelve-hour shift per day.

 Much of the information in this section comes from personal discussions with industry participants, TLC Rules
documents made available by the TLC, and Urbanomics (2004).

                                                                                                                 9
Discussions with industry participants indicate that owner-drivers often find lessees through

family-members, neighbors, and friends, though anonymous matches are also common.

        The costs and revenues of operation are split between the lessee-driver and the owner-

driver as follows. The owner is required by the TLC to pay for no-fault and liability insurance

($7,000 to $13,000 per year) and workers’ compensation for the lessee-driver ($1,400 to $3,000

per year), licensing fees (approximately $1,000 per year), vehicle inspections ($50), and fines for

improper usage of the taxi, some of which may be due to the lessee’s actions. Owners also pay

for all vehicle maintenance and repair ($4,000 to $10,000 per year) and for vehicle replacement

(approximately $28,000).8 Repairs are typically conducted at garages chosen by the owner-driver

that specialize in servicing taxis but are also sometimes conducted at other garages.

        Lessees pay for their own gas usage ($5,000 to $10,000 per year), tolls, parking tickets,

fines for DMV and TLC violations, and TLC fees (approximately $100 per year) that they

themselves generated. Lessees also pay a flat lease fee to the owner. The lease fee is capped by

the TLC at a maximum amount that owners can charge lessees per lease period, which industry

participants indicate is respected in practice and nearly always binds (TLC (2006)). Lessees often

provide a modest deposit, which is sometimes forfeited to the owner if the lessee has an at-fault

accident. During the sample period, the deposit amount was capped by the TLC at $500 for long-

term lessees.9 Lessee-drivers keep all fares and tips that they generate.

Measures of owners’ costs that are generated by drivers

        As described above, lessee-drivers generate three types of costs that are borne by taxi



8
  Note that is the vehicle owner who pays all repair costs. Since we are primarily examining drivers who lease from
owner-drivers, it is these owner-drivers who pay repair costs.
9
  There exist industry programs that could provide incentives for better driving outcomes (they stipulate license
suspension and revocation for repeated violations), but they have typically not been enforced. Another program
reduces insurance premium if all lessees of the medallion have a good driving record.

                                                                                                                 10
owners, which we discuss in detail now. The first is repair costs associated with vehicle

mechanical failures and other maintenance work. Given that New York City taxis are operated in

heavily congested urban conditions for an average of 175 miles per day, the driver’s level of

vehicle care can quickly show up in vehicle condition.10 The second type of cost is from

accidents. Approximately one-third of taxis are involved in a serious accident per year (defined

as having over $1000 in damage or involves injuries). Again, driver aggressiveness such as

speeding or cutting across traffic to pick up a hailing passenger (a common site in Manhattan)

increases the likelihood of accidents. The third type of cost is for fines to owners stemming from

driver behavior. Owners receive fines ranging from $25 to $100 per instance when drivers do not

adequately record information on passenger trips they provide, when the vehicle is not in

satisfactory condition, either regarding cleanliness or safety, and when items such as the driver’s

taxi license are not properly displayed.11

        Drivers typically pay little or none of the repair and maintenance costs, a fraction or none

of the costs of an accident, and only a fraction of the costs of fines from violations given they do

not pay the owner’s portion (drivers may receive a fine themselves for failing to adequately

record trip information, keep the taxi in good condition, or properly display all required

information). However, drivers keep all the fare revenues they generate. Given that revenues and

costs are increasing in driver aggressiveness, we can see that drivers face a moral hazard.




                                                3. THE DATA



10
   For example, in conversations with taxi owners, some indicated to us that the brakes must be replaced every few
weeks. Whether the driver is aggressively accelerating and braking, taking care to avoid potholes and curbs, and so
on can have an important effect on an owner’s repair costs.
11
   New York City police has jurisdiction over enforcing many New York City taxi regulations, and the violations are
typically assigned during police stops of the taxi during regular taxi operation.

                                                                                                                11
A.         Description of the TLC data

           Data were provided by the TLC under a proprietary data-sharing agreement and contain

information about all drivers of New York City yellow taxis during two time periods: the spring

of 2005 and fall of 2007. The 2005 data contain driver-level records on three types of driving

outcomes: Accidents, convictions, and summonses. The accident records describe all accidents

involving taxis with injuries or property damage exceeding $1000 to any vehicle involved. The

violations records describe all drivers’ convictions for driving violations during taxi operation for

which points are issued against a DMV driver’s license. The summons records describe all

summonses, which are issued for TLC violations (as opposed to DMV driving violations) such

as passenger service refusals, using the taxi for unlawful purpose, and missing required items

from the taxi such as the display of the driver’s taxi-driving license.

           The 2007 data only contain records for the summons outcomes and not the accident and

violations outcomes (the latter outcomes originate from the New York City police department,

and were not available for 2007).12 In addition to being available only for 2005, the accidents and

convictions records also have more limited variation than the summons records. Approximately

24 percent of drivers receive at least one summons during a six-month period versus 14 percent

having a conviction and 4 percent having an accident. Because of the added power for tests, and

its panel nature, we focus our analysis on summonses. However, we are careful to show that our

results are robust for accidents and convictions.

           Summonses are given for a range of TLC violations. Some of these driver violations

generate costs for owners directly: owners receive fines for missing items, missing trip records,

and vehicle condition violations stemming from the actions of drivers to whom they lease. Some



12
     We top-code outcomes to three to limit the impact of outliers, though less than one percent of drivers are affected.

                                                                                                                      12
of these driver violations generate costs for owners indirectly: using the taxi for an unlawful

purpose may risk the taxi (for example, temporary impounding), hazardous moving violations,

and possibly shift violations, in particular smoking in the taxi. Some driver violation may not

affect owner costs directly, but may reflect general driving style and also level of vehicle usage.

Since violations frequency likely increases monotonically with usage, and lessee-drivers may

operate their taxis for longer than owner-drivers because they do not pay the full cost of

operation, higher usage may also reflect moral hazard.

         The driver-level data also record each driver’s country of birth and 2005 address, and for

drivers entering after 1997, whether the driver passed an English-language test and his score on a

written driving test, both of which the driver must pass to obtain a taxi-driving license.13 We

calculate a driver’s New York City taxi-driving experience from the number of months

registered as an active New York City taxi driver, which we derive from his taxi driver’s license

numbers.14 Driver-level records are available for both lessee-drivers and owner-drivers.

         Two driver-of-record files identify the taxi each long-term lessee-driver and owner-driver

was registered to operate on April 2, 2005 and October 21, 2007, which we use to merge the

driver and owner data.15 Owners receive a significant discount on insurance premiums when they

register specific “named-drivers” with the TLC and the insurance provider. These named-drivers

are then the exclusive operators of that taxi (including the owner himself when he drives), and




13
   The English-language test is aimed to ensure that drivers can communicate with passengers, while the written
driving test is on New York City geography and DMV and TLC regulations.
14
   Taxi-driving license numbers are issued sequentially, which allows us to identify when a license was issued. We
thank Bruce Schaller for providing this algorithm.
15
   Taxis not in the driver-of-record file have “unspecified” drivers, and TLC officials and industry participants
indicate they are nearly always short-term lessees. Since short-term lessees operate different taxis every day, they
cannot be matched in the data to specific taxis and hence owner countries, and are excluded from the analysis.

                                                                                                                   13
these matches constitute the driver-of-record file.16 Taxis with such named-drivers represent

9,535 of the 12,779 taxis in 2005 and 9,025 of the 12,953 taxis in 2007. Since we only know the

driver-taxi match on these two dates, we restrict the majority of the analysis to the periods

surrounding these dates.

         For the long-term lessees, the driver-of-record files record the current lease period, which

typically are six months intervals (50 percent are between 177 and 183 days long, and 95 percent

are between 147 and 189 days long). We match the dates of offense for the summons,

convictions, and accidents to these lease periods to identify the drivers’ outcomes associated with

particular taxis. To make the driving outcomes comparable across drivers with different lease

period lengths, we use the recorded lengths to normalize the number of incidences to 182 days.

         We supplement the TLC data with Census data on driver/owner neighborhood

characteristics, most importantly the fraction of residents in the driver/owner Census tract from

the same country of birth (resident country of birth is only reported at the tract level), which we

match to drivers/owners using their addresses.17

         Table 1 reports summary statistics for the primary variables of interest for our sample. It

shows that drivers have 11 years of NYC taxi-driving experience on average, that almost half of

drivers lease in-network, and that approximately one in three drivers receives a summons, one in

six has a conviction, and one in twenty has a serious accident per six month period.

B.       Discussion of driving outcome measures



16
   Because of the large financial incentives to accurately report named-drivers, we believe these records are accurate.
Furthermore, summonses for inaccurate named-driver records are very infrequent.
17
   The country of birth recorded in the TLC data is occasionally more precise than the country of birth in the Census
data. For example, the Census and TLC data both record the European countries, England, Ireland, Sweden, Austria,
France, Germany, Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Czech Republic or Slovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia. However, the TLC data record the additional European
countries, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Moldova. These additional countries are
assigned to the Census categories, “Other western Europe,” “Other southern Europe,” and “Other eastern Europe.”

                                                                                                                    14
         Our data do not contain measures of vehicle maintenance, repair, and replacement costs

borne by the owner.18 Instead as mentioned above we examine three measures that either directly

or indirectly reflect costs generated by the driver but that are borne by the owner. One measure is

accidents, which, unlike maintenance and repairs, can be attributed directly to individual drivers.

The second measure is convictions for driving violations, such as speeding or disobeying other

traffic laws, which are enforced and processed in the same way as ordinary motorists’ driving

violations. Both accidents and convictions directly reflect driver ability and aggressiveness, and

hence are likely to reflect on average risk for owners from unsafe driving. In fact, Gebers (2003)

finds that prior violations more accurately predict future accidents than prior accidents

themselves (which is also a strong predictor of future accidents).

         Our third measure is summons, which are issued for TLC violations (as opposed to DMV

driving violations) based on a driver’s action for which owners receive fines directly, such as

when a required item is missing from the taxi like the driver’s taxi-driving license (as mentioned

above), and also for actions for which the owner does not directly receive a fine, for example for

failing to satisfy a reasonable passenger request or smoking in the taxi, which reflects a general

tendency regarding conscientious versus careless driving. We believe some types of summons

better reflect a driver’s driving style and conscientiousness than others. However, we have no

way to identify precisely which summons types are most reflective, and hence we aggregate all

summonses for the primary analysis. However we also provide results broken out by summons

type to show that individual types indeed conform to our expectations of which are more likely

to be susceptible to moral hazard.

C.       Availability of country-of-birth data


18
  This data would not reveal directly the costs generated by the lessee-driver anyway since attributing repair costs to
the owner-driver versus the lessee-driver would be challenging given both operate the taxi nearly every day.

                                                                                                                    15
         Our primary analysis relies on country-of-birth data being available for both the lessee-

driver and also the owner from whom he leases. Country data for both parties must be present to

identify whether the driver is leasing from a same-country owner. Table 2 reports the numbers of

drivers with available country data for both the driver and owner, along with mean New York

City taxi driving experience of these drivers.19

         The table shows that country data for both the lessee and owner are available for 1,955

and 2,053 lessees in the 2005 and 2007 data respectively, and that lessees with country data have

only slightly more experience than lessees without data. Drivers with country data also have a

similar distribution over race than drivers without country data (not shown in the table),

suggesting that the distribution over countries is similar for drivers with and without country

data.20 Drivers with and without country data also have similar English-language and driving-test

results (also not shown). Therefore, based on the observable driver characteristics that are

available to us, we have no reason to believe that the drivers that we analyze are systematically

different than the drivers for which country data are missing.

         Most lessee-drivers with available country data for both the driver and the owner share a

taxi with an owner-driver (that is, they operate owner-driver taxis, as opposed to non-owner-

driver taxis).21 Thus, the sample we analyze consists primarily of lessee-drivers who lease from

owner-drivers. This sample is attractive for studying social networks because owner-drivers are

most likely to be invested in the condition of their vehicle (since they drive most days) and



19
   Note that Table 1 reports slightly fewer observations than Table 2 because Table 1 reports summary statistics only
for observations for which country-level data are available and data are non-missing for all other variables used in
the regression analysis, while Table 2 only examines the number of drivers for which country data are available
regardless of the availability of other variables.
20
   Fifty-four, 23, and 13 percent of drivers with country data were Asian (including South Asian), Black, and White,
respectively, while 58, 22, and 8 percent of drivers without country data were Asian, Black and White.
21
   The reason country data are available primarily only for lessee-drivers on owner-driver taxis is because country
data are available for most drivers, including owner-drivers, but not for non-driving owners.

                                                                                                                  16
interact with the lessee regularly, thereby facilitating a social connection, as opposed to non-

driving owners, who often own many hundreds of taxis, and hence likely have more anonymous

relationships with drivers regardless of whether they share a common country of birth. Table 2

shows that a small fraction of lessee-drivers that have country-level data available lease from

non-driving owners and hence are included in our sample. The results throughout are similar and

modestly stronger when they are excluded.22



                                   4. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

        There are two important potential benefits of in-network driving. The first is better

screening such that owners can better assess the ability of drivers from the same country and as

such are more likely to hire drivers from the same country. The second is that drivers from the

same country exert higher levels of effort than drivers who lease from owners from a different

country (we explain reasons for this in greater detail below).

A.      Potential benefits of in-network leasing

        Even in the case where in-network drivers do not exert more effort than out-of-network

drivers, one might observe high rates of in-network leasing and different driving outcomes on

average for in-network drivers versus out-of-network drivers. This would be due to screening.

i. The screening technology may be better in network. Specifically, due to information flows

     about prospective drivers via the country-of-birth network, owners may be better able to

     determine the ability of same-country drivers versus different-country drivers, and therefore

     select different ability drivers for in-network versus out-of-network.



22
  Note that we do not examine owner-driver outcomes in the main text of this study because we are interested in
comparing in-network versus out-of-network lessee-drivers. However, owner-driver results are available in
Schneider (2010) as well as the online appendix.

                                                                                                                  17
There are a few reasons why all else equal drivers who lease from an owner from the same

country of birth might exert higher levels of effort than drivers who do not.

ii. Social preferences on the part of drivers may lead drivers to exhibit more altruistic behavior

     toward owners from the same country versus owners from a different country. It is well

     documented that people tend to be willing to give up some of their own material self-interest

     in order to improve the welfare of others with whom they have close social ties.23

iii. Social ties may create social collateral (Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Szeidl 2009) such

     that individuals derive positive utility from ties and have a disincentive to behave in ways

     that harm them. Benefits may be non-pecuniary, such as enjoying a friendship or gaining

     spousal prospects, or arrive in the future, such as having a resource for job information or a

     loan in times of need. Persons from the same country are much more likely to have a strong

     social tie and hence have significant social collateral than persons from different countries.

iv. Individuals are better able to impose social sanctions on others from the same group versus a

     different group. For the same reasons that social collateral creates a disincentive to behave in

     ways that harm a relationship, group membership creates disincentives to behave in ways that

     lead others to exclude one from the benefits of membership. In the current context, owners

     have more leverage over drivers from the same country versus a different country, leading

     drivers to exert more effort toward the objectives of same-country owners, all else equal.

v. Owners’ costs of monitoring the behavior of drivers might be lower for drivers from the

     same country versus a different country given the more frequent interactions between driver



23
  For example, Fong and Luttmer (2009) find in a charitable-giving experiment that respondents who report feeling
close to their racial or ethnic group give substantially more when victims are of the same race and Hungerman
(forthcoming) finds that the charitable activity of all-white religious congregations decreases in the fraction of
blacks in the community. It has even been documented that food giving is much more common in the animal
kingdom among kin (Stevens and Gilby (2003)), suggesting that affinity for group members is a basic instinct.

                                                                                                                18
     and owner through network ties. Specifically, drivers may have a higher chance of being

     caught driving with insufficient care when they lease in network versus out-of-network,

     giving in-network drivers greater disincentive to exert insufficient care, all else equal.24

B.       Theoretical model

         We now present a simple theoretical model of how owners choose which drivers to hire.

The model provides testable implications that will help us disentangle the effort effects versus

the screening effects.

         Using a modified version of a standard job search model, we consider the owner’s

decision of whether to lease to a potential driver to whom he has come in contact. This is a

discrete time, infinite-horizon model, where, for simplicity, the owners are infinitely lived and

have discount factor . As long as the owner has not hired a driver, the owner comes in contact

with one potential driver per period. The potential driver’s ability, α, is drawn i.i.d. from a

continuous distribution F with mean α+>0 and support A, and represents the innate attributes of

the driver that may limit the owner’s costs.25

         If the owner hires a driver with ability α, he gets a payoff of α+e each period forever,

where e 0 represents the level of effort exerted by the driver to limit the owner’s costs. If the

owner rejects the driver, the owner receives a payoff of 0 this period and draws again next
                                                                                          +
period. We also assume that the probability of drawing an ability α<                          is greater than zero.

This condition guarantees that some drivers will be rejected in equilibrium.



24
   We list this possibility because it has been used in the micro-credit loan market to argue that individuals may be
able to monitor borrowers from the same group better than a large bank can monitor borrowers (for example, Stiglitz
(1990)). However, later we will argue that this channel is unlikely to be important in the taxi market.
25
   To keep the model simple, we assume a new pool of potential drivers enters each period such that we have a
stationary distribution over the abilities of potential drivers. This implies that if a driver is rejected, he does not come
in contact with another owner-driver from whom he could lease (although of course he may remain in the industry
and lease from a non-driving owner).

                                                                                                                         19
           Owners and drivers belong to one of at least two networks. Each period, the probability

that the potential driver being considered by an owner from network j is from the same network

is   j   (again, the distribution over ability within network is the common distribution F).

Effort effects

           We now solve the model in the case that owners fully observe the abilities of both in-

network and out-of-network drivers. The importance of the network in this case comes from the

additional effort that driving in-network induces. We normalize in-network effort to be e=e’>0

and out-of-network effort to be e=0. To solve for an equilibrium, we set up the standard Bellman

equation,

           Vj(α+e) = max{((α+e)/(1-β)), βδj∫AVj(α’+e’)f(α’)dα’ + β(1-δj)∫AVj(α’)f(α’)dα’}

The value function, V( ), which is bounded and weakly increasing, has a unique solution.26

           The decision rule for an owner is simple. The owner will hire the potential driver if his

ability plus effort is greater than the expected payoff of waiting for another potential driver.

Thus, the owner uses a minimum cutoff level of his payoff α+e in deciding whether to hire a

potential driver. The expected payoff of waiting will be the same regardless of whether the

potential driver is in-network or not. However, conditional on ability level, in-network drivers

generate a higher payoff for the owner due to the positive in-network effort effects. Therefore,

the owner will use a lower cutoff for ability for in-network drivers relative to out-of-network

drivers in the hiring decision. The opportunity cost of searching for another driver, and this lower

ability cutoff, generates a lower average ability of in-network relative to out-of-network drivers.




26
  The transformation TVj( +e) = max{(( +e)/(1-β)), βδj∫AVj( ’+e’)f( ’)d ’ + β(1-δj)∫AVj( ’)f( ’)d ’}
satisfies Blackwell’s (1965) sufficient conditions to be a contraction mapping. Therefore the value function has a
unique solution.

                                                                                                                 20
Proposition 1: Under effort effects, the average ability of in-network drivers is lower than the

average ability of out-of-network drivers.



Proof: The lowest ability driver that an owner will hire will be K(1-β)-e, where

K=βδj∫AV(α+e’)f(α)dα+β(1-δj)∫AV(α)f(α)dα. This cutoff value is smaller for in-network drivers

since in-network drivers exert higher effort. Therefore the average ability of in-network drivers

will be lower that the average ability out-of-network drivers.



Screening effects

       We now consider the effect of screening. For simplicity, we assume that effort is the

same for both in-network and out-of-network drivers and normalized to e=0 (however, it will be

straightforward to see that the prediction also holds under in-network effort effects). Under

screening, owners can still observe the ability of potential in-network drivers (which he learns

about through contacts within the network), but now cannot observe the ability of potential out-

of-network drivers. Thus, if the owner comes in contact with an out-of-network driver in some

period, the owner treats the driver as if he has the average ability for the population, α+. The

Bellman equation representing the owner’s problem is now,

       Vj(α) = max{(α/(1-β)), βδj∫AVj(α’)f(α’)dα’ + β(1-δj)Vj(α+)}

which again satisfies the conditions for a unique solution.

       As before, an owner will hire a potential driver if the driver’s ability is above some

threshold. This threshold may lie above or below the average ability of out-of-network drivers.

This implies that, depending on the parameter values, owners hire either all out-of-networks or

no out-of-network drivers that they encounter. The owner’s knowledge about the ability of



                                                                                                   21
drivers in their network allows the owner to be more selective regarding drivers in their network.



Proposition 2: If out-of-network drivers are hired, they will have the same average ability as the

population of potential drivers. The average ability of in-network drivers who are hired,

however, will be higher than the average ability of the population of potential drivers.



Proof: To show this we need only to show that some in-network drivers will be rejected. Let us

show this by contradiction. Suppose that all applicants are hired. This implies that Vj(α)=(α/(1-

β)) for all α. Therefore it is better to hire the lowest ability type αL than to reject and draw again.

Accepting every applicant implies ((αL /(1-β))≥ β(α+/(1-β)). But this contradicts the earlier
                                                                           +
assumption that there are some possible ability types that lie below β         . There must be some

ability types low enough that they are rejected in equilibrium. The average ability of in-network

drivers accepted must be above the average ability of population of potential drivers.



As before, information about a driver’s ability is useful to the owner. Some in-network drivers

have sufficiently low ability that in-network owners reject them. Thus, the average ability of in-

network drivers that are accepted is higher than the average ability of potential drivers. Since

out-of-network drivers appear to the owner to have average ability, owners hire all out-of-

network drivers they encounter if his hiring cutoff level is below the average ability in the

population, and rejects all out-of-network if his cutoff level is above the average ability in the

population. Thus, if there is an owner who accepts out-of-network drivers, the average ability of

such drivers will be lower than in-network drivers.

        Finally, note that we have not specified the arrival rate of in-network versus out-of-


                                                                                                      22
network drivers. However, it is apparent that proportionally more in-network owners arrive

versus out-of-network owners compared to their ratio in the population, as we might expect, then

many or most hired drivers will be in-network, in particular under effort effects. We also expect

that networks with higher ratios of drivers to owners have a higher arrival rate of in-network

drivers. As Table 3 shows, these ratios vary considerably across countries, and the fraction of

drivers who are in-network appears to be closely related to these ratios.

C.     Disentangling screening versus effort effects

       From the model it is clear that the high rate of in-network leasing could be due to either

effort effects or to screening, depending on the arrival rate of in-network versus out-of-network

drivers and the parameter values. However, we also know that better in-network outcomes

conditional on ability can only be due to effort effects. From Propositions 1 and 2, we now also

know that in-network drivers will have higher average ability than out-of-network drivers under

screening (assuming out-of-network driving occurs at all, and regardless of effort effects) but

lower average ability than out-of-network drivers under effort effects but no screening. Thus, the

outcomes of in-network drivers conditional on ability should be better than the outcomes of in-

network drivers unconditional on ability under no screening but worse than the outcomes of in-

network drivers unconditional on ability under screening. In summary, the effect of in-network

driving on outcomes conditional on ability provides a test of effort effects, while the effect of

conditioning the outcomes on ability provides a test of screening.



                                  5. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY

       Among the aims of this paper are (1) to document the degree and direction of any

selection on driver ability into driving a taxi owned by someone from the same country, and (2)



                                                                                                    23
to remove any selection bias to uncover the causal effect (the effort effect) of driving a taxi

owned by someone from the same country. To identify the casual effect of in-network driving,

we use three distinct sources of arguably exogenous variation in in-network driving. Results

from these separate sources of variation provide a robustness check on each other.

A.      Baseline model

        Our basic empirical strategy is to compare the driving outcomes of drivers who lease

from an owner from the same country of birth to the driving outcomes of drivers who lease from

an owner from a different country of birth. Specifically, we estimate the following model by

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS),

[1]             Yit =   Sameit + ln(Expit) +      i   +   it


In [1], Yit is the outcome of driver i at time t, which is the number of accidents, convictions, or

summons, Sameit is an indicator variable denoting whether driver i leases from an owner from

the same country of birth at time t, Expit is the experience level of driver i at time t, αi is the

unobserved time invariant ability level of driver i, and εit is the idiosyncratic error term. Because

driver ability is not observed, the total error term is αi+εit.

        OLS estimates of [1] are unlikely to yield the causal effect of in-network driving because

owners may select the drivers to which they lease based on unobserved driver ability. As such,

OLS estimates of β may be biased depending on the nature of the selection. In the presence of

screening, where owners can better observe ability for same-country drivers such that same-

country drivers are higher ability, there would be positive selection and the OLS estimates of β

would be biased downward (more negative). Alternatively, if owners know that same-country

drivers will exert more effort, making owners more willing to hire same-country drivers of lower

ability, there would be negative selection and the OLS estimates of β would be biased upward


                                                                                                      24
(less negative). As such, comparing the OLS estimates to estimates obtained from a model that

isolates the casual effect of being a same-country driver will be informative about the selection

process. We propose three strategies to remove the effects of selection, which we describe now.

B.      Cross-country identification strategy

        The first strategy to isolate the effort effect is to aggregate driving outcomes to the

country level and to use cross-country variation in leasing rates to test whether countries with

relatively higher in-network lease rates have relatively better driving outcomes. Aggregating

driving outcomes to the country level controls for any selection on ability into in-network leasing

that occurs within groups of individuals from the same country of birth. This strategy will

uncover a causal effect so long as differences in in-network driving across countries are not

systematically related to differences in unobserved driver ability across countries. To implement

this strategy we estimate the following model by OLS,

[2]             Yct =    Samect + (ln(Expt))c +   ct


where the c subscript indicates a country-level mean. Since the model assumes that mean driver

ability by country ( c) is uncorrelated with in-network lease rate by country (Samect ) after

conditioning on mean experience by country ((ln(Expt))c), the estimate of the network effect

isolates the effort effect.

C.      Within-driver identification strategy

        The second strategy to isolate the effort effect is to use within-driver variation in same

versus different-country leasing. Specifically, with two observations per driver over time, in

2005 and 2007, we can compare the outcomes of drivers who leased from a same-country owner

in one period and a different-country owner in another period. By comparing the outcomes of the

same drivers over time we effectively remove the contribution of time-invariant ability on


                                                                                                     25
driving outcomes (the contribution due to selection), thus isolating the effort effect. Specifically,

we estimate the following differenced (within-driver) model by OLS,

[3]                Yi =       Samei + ln(Expi) +            i


All variables are defined as before, but now the time-invariant ability component is differenced

away, so that the error term Δεi does not reflect the effects of selection. Identification of the

effort effect β comes from drivers who switch from leasing from a same-country owner to a

different-country owner (and vice versa). The identifying assumption is that any changes in

unobserved characteristics that affect driving outcomes are orthogonal to changes in same-

country driving status over time. It is worth noting that this model estimates a local treatment

effect for switchers who make up only 3.2 percent of the sample (58 drivers), so while the effect

may be well identified it does not necessarily generalize to all drivers (note that this limitation

applies to all within-entity models). This is one motivation for our use of two other completely

different sources of variation to identify effort effects.27

D.       Cross-sectional instrumental variables strategy

         Finally, we exploit the variation in leasing from a same-country owner that is due to the

residential locations of drivers versus same-country owners. The idea is that drivers may be more

likely to lease from an owner who lives nearby versus far away all else equal. Thus a driver who

happens to live near a same-country owner should be more likely to lease from a same-country

owner simply because he lives close to that owner. Using the 2005 addresses of drivers and

owners, we compute the minimum distance of each driver to a same-country owner in the data.



27
  Nevertheless, the observed characteristics of switchers are unremarkable. On average, switchers have 10.9 years
of experience and are 44.4 years old versus 11.1 years of experience and 44.5 years old for non-switchers. Sixteen,
12, 11, 9, and 9 switchers are from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Haiti, and other countries, respectively, which is
proportionally similar to non-switcher countries of birth. Twenty-five drivers switched to in-network leasing
between 2005 and 2007 while 33 drivers switched away from in-network leasing between 2005 and 2007.

                                                                                                                  26
We then use this distance as an exogenous instrument for in-network leasing to isolate the causal

effect of in-network driving.

         To be a valid instrument, this distance measure must (a) be correlated with in-network

driving, (b) not be correlated with unobserved ability, (c) have a monotonic relationship with

being a same-country driver. Figure 1 shows clearly that distance to the closest same-country

owner predicts leasing from a same-country owner. The effect however is most pronounced for

distances of less than two-tenths of a mile, and for this reason we specify our instrument as an

indicator for whether the driver lives in the same Census block as a same-country owner.28

Figure 1 also shows that distance to a same-country owner is unrelated to driving experience,

which is the best measure of driver ability in our data. It is also clear from the figure that the

relationship between distance to a same-country owner and being a same-country driver is

monotonic. We present formal econometric tests of the validity of the instrument in Section 6. 29

         In summary, we exploit this variation in residential locations of drivers vis-à-vis owners

to predict network status, and then use these predicted values in a regression on driving

outcomes. Specifically we estimate the following system of equations by 2SLS,

[4]               Samei = Disti     1+   ln(Expi)   2   + θ1c +   1i


[5]               Yi =    Samei + ln(Expi) + θ2c +          2i


In [4] and [5] all variables are defined as before (but there is no longer any time variation), θc is a

country of birth fixed effect, and the error term ν includes both the idiosyncratic variation and




28
   Using same Census tract or log of distance to the nearest same-country owner gives similar though modestly
weaker results due to a weaker first stage.
29
   A slightly different interpretation of the instrumental variable estimate is that leasing from a same-country owner
who also lives nearby facilitates stronger network effects, for example, because an owner can better enforce social
sanctions. However, the OLS estimates of the network effect are similar for drivers living nearby the owner versus
far away from the owner, indicating that the existence of network effects is not predicated on geographic proximity.
Regardless, the alternate interpretation would still indicate the presence of network effects.

                                                                                                                    27
driver ability. This model exploits variation in residential locations of drivers who come from the

same country of birth to remove selection to in-network driving.

        To present evidence that our instrumental variables model is valid, we tests whether our

distance measure is correlated with both our observed measures of driver ability and an estimate

of the unobserved component of driver ability. In most situations where instrumental variables

are used, authors cannot directly test the identifying assumption of their model (that is, that the

instrument is uncorrelated with the unobserved error term). In our context, because we have

longitudinal data but our instrument relies on cross-sectional variation, we can identify driver

ability and then test whether our estimates of unobserved ability are correlated with our

instrument. Specifically, we can obtain estimates of driver ability (αi) from our driver fixed

effects model and then see if these estimates are correlated with the instrument.30



                                                 6. RESULTS

A.      Determinants of in-network driving

        One of the principal predictions of the model is that where there are screening effects or

effort effects there will be much more in-network driving observed in the data than would be

predicted by random chance or by residential sorting alone. In this sub-section, before

presenting evidence on the effects of in-network driving on outcomes, we provide compelling

evidence that this central prediction of our model holds in the data.




30
   We also use a mixed effects estimator to obtain the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) of driver ability and
find that these are also not correlated with our instrument. This mixed effects method for identifying BLUPs is used
in Jackson (2010) and Woodcock (2009). See Woodcock (2009) for detailed discussion of their properties.

                                                                                                                 28
           Table 3 reports the number of lessees by lessee country broken out by the corresponding

owner country.31 The patterns suggest that owners lease to drivers within their network when

they can. For countries with more drivers than owners, owners mostly lease to drivers from the

same country, but many drivers do not lease from same-country owners. For example, there are

291 Bangladeshi drivers but Bangladeshi owners lease to only 148 total drivers total, and

consequently only 133 of 291 Bangladeshi drivers lease from Bangladeshi owners, while 133 of

148 drivers leasing from Bangladeshi owners were Bangladeshi. For countries with fewer drivers

than owners, owners often lease to different-country drivers, while most drivers lease from same-

country owners. For example, there are 12 Greek lessees but Greek owners lease to 52 drivers,

and 10 of 12 Greek drivers lease from Greek owners, while only 10 of the 52 drivers to whom

Greek owners lease are Greek.

           These patterns are consistent with drivers being more likely to lease in-network than

would be predicted by random chance, and with there being a benefit to in-network driving.

However, this is not a conclusive test. Given that many drivers may live in ethnic enclaves, a

preference for proximity would also generate more in-network leasing than random chance.

Given that 24 percent of drivers in our data lease from an owner who lives in the same Census

block, it is plausible that the patterns are picking up a "proximity" effect rather than an "in-

network" effect. As such, showing that the pattern of in-network driving is not determined by

proximity alone is key to showing that all else equal the likelihood of leasing is higher in-

network than out-of-network.

           To show this we test the hypothesis that the patterns observed in the data are driven by

proximity alone and that the leasing decisions are not affected by the network status of the



31
     The table reports 2005 data, but 2007 patterns are similar.

                                                                                                      29
drivers and owners. To do this we create an indicator variable equal to one if a driver leases from

an owner who lives in the same Census block as themselves and zero otherwise. Under the null

hypothesis that the countries of birth of the owners and drivers have no effect on the decision of

from whom to lease, then conditional on having any owners in the same Census block, the

country of birth of the owners should have no effect on the likelihood of leasing from an owner

who lives in the same block.

       Table 4 shows results from a regression where the dependent variable is an indicator for

whether the driver leases from an owner in the same block and the explanatory variables are

indicators for having any owners in the same block and any in-network owners in the same

block. The results show that the likelihood of leasing from a neighbor is 32 percentage points

higher (p < .01) when there is an owner from the same country in the block. Also, conditional on

whether there is an owner from the same country in the same block, having any owner in the

block has a relatively small effect on leasing from that owner. The results provide a clear

indication that the prevalence of in-network driving cannot be explained by proximity alone ─

indicative of there being benefits to leasing in-network. Having established the high prevalence

of in-network driving (a central prediction of our model), we now turn to our estimates of driving

in-network on outcomes.

B.     Baseline analysis

       Table 5 provides regression evidence regarding the effect of in-network driving on

driving outcomes. Column (1) shows OLS results for a driver’s number of summonses. Drivers

leasing in-network have 0.09 fewer summonses (p < .01), which is a moderate-size effect relative

to the standard deviation of the number of summonses per driver of 0.72. Driver country-of-birth

fixed effects are included in column (2) to address the possibility that drivers from some



                                                                                                 30
countries are systematically better or worse in ways that are correlated with the probability of in-

network leasing and the results are similar.32 In the OLS and all other specifications, when driver

age is included, the estimate of the age effect is small in magnitude and not statistically

significant after controlling for experience, nor does it affect the estimate of in-network driving

effect. Including Census neighborhood characteristics, such as median income and education

level, also does not affect the estimate of the in-network driving effect (although Census data are

only available for 2005 outcomes due to address data being available only for this year). We

therefore use the more parsimonious specification that includes only experience.

C.      Country-level analysis

        We begin by showing in Figure 2 the relationship between the mean numbers of

summonses per driver by country versus the fraction of drivers from that country leasing from an

owner from the same country.33 The figure shows clearly that driving outcomes are better for

drivers from countries with more in-network leasing, with a switch of all drivers from out-of-

network to in-network leasing corresponding to 0.35 fewer summonses per driver.

        We can investigate the relationship more formally however by estimating equation [2] in

order to control for the effect of any differences in average driver experience across countries.

Column (3) of Table 5 provides these results, showing that the in-network leasing effect is

substantially larger than in columns (1) and (2) and is statistically significant (p=.01). As

discussed in Section 5, the country-level estimates identify the true causal effect of social ties on

driver effort (separate from selection on ability) by eliminating any within-country correlation



32
   Results are similar when the models are estimate with 2005 and 2007 data separately, and with Poisson and the
more flexible negative binomial regression models, and are available in an online appendix.
33
   Data for countries with at least five drivers are included (55 countries) with the area of the bubble being
proportional the number of drivers. Country labels for the points in the figure are not included because the TLC
requested that country-level driving outcomes not be reported.

                                                                                                                   31
between unobserved driver ability and in-network leasing. The identifying assumption is that any

country-level differences in ability are uncorrelated with country-level in-network lease rates

after controlling for country-level differences in driving experience. The estimate indicates that a

country with all in-network driving will have 0.35 fewer summonses per driver than a country

with no in-network driving.

D.      Within-driver analysis

        Column (4) exploits the panel nature of the data to include driver fixed effects. The effect

is substantially larger than the OLS estimate and is statistically significant (p < .01). As

discussed in Section 5, this estimate is likely to isolate the true causal effect of social ties on

driver effort as it controls for time-invariant driver ability, and hence removes any bias due to (a)

selection across countries into in-network driving, and (b) selection within countries but across

drivers into in-network driving.

        As a check of the identifying assumption that changes in in-network status between 2005

and 2007 are not associated with unobserved changes in factors that may affect driving

outcomes, we break out the effect separately for drivers switching from in-network to out-of-

network leasing between 2005 and 2007 versus from out-of-network to in-network leasing

between 2005 and 2007. If the switching process is endogenous (for example, drivers tend to

switch taxis after an accident but subsequently have safe driving outcomes), then the effect of

switching into versus away from in-network driving might be different. Column (5) breaks out

the effect for drivers switching away from in-network driving between 2005 and 2007 (“Lease in

network”) versus switching into in-network leasing between 2005 and 2007 (“Lease in network x

lease out of network in 2005,” which is additive to the “Lease in network” estimate). While

drivers switching away from in-network driving show a larger effect, the estimates for both types



                                                                                                      32
of switchers are much larger than the OLS estimates, and the two types are not statistically

different (p=.18).34

E.       Instrumental-variables analysis

         Column (6) and (7) contains the instrumental variables results, where the instrument for

in-network driving is an indicator for whether the driver lives in the same Census block as an

owner from the same country. The first-stage F-statistic for the excluded instrument is 131 and

41 depending on whether driver country fixed effects are included, indicating a strong

instrument. Again the estimate of the effect of in-network leasing is statistically significant and

substantially larger than the OLS estimates (p=0.05). When driver country fixed effects are

included, the estimate is very similar, though not surprisingly is less precise given the weaker

first stage F-statistic.35,36

         In Table 6, we provide evidence from falsification tests that the instrument is

uncorrelated with driver ability. In columns (1)-(6) we find no evidence of a systematic

relationship between the instrument and observed measures we expect to reflect driver ability.

Columns (1) and (2) show in a regression of experience, the strongest predictor of driving

outcomes in our data, versus the instrument, that the instrument has approximately zero effect on

experience. Columns (3)-(6) show that the instrument also has essentially no effect on driver test

outcomes we might expect to predict driver ability, which is whether the driver passed an

English language test and the driver’s score on a driving test (these tests are described in Section

3). Finally, we examine a direct measure of unobserved driver ability, the estimate of                     i   from the

34
   Note that even though all drivers in the panel have two additional years of experience in 2007 versus 2005, the
effect of log of experience is identified due to the nonlinearity of the measure. The nonlinear measure of experience
is suitable given that the marginal benefit of experience almost certainly decreases with experience.
35
   Columns (6) and (7) also report the estimated coefficients on the excluded instrument in the first stage regression,
showing that the instrument to be a very strong predictor of network status.
36
   Note that the sample size for these specifications is smaller than previous specifications since the instrument is
based on driver and owner addresses, which are only available in the 2005 data.

                                                                                                                     33
within-driver model. This puts us in the unusual position of being able to test directly the

identifying assumption of the instrumental variables model, that the instrument is uncorrelated

with the unobserved error term. Columns (7) and (8) show the effect to be approximately zero.

F.      Analysis by summons type and alternative driving outcomes

        If effort effects are indeed driving the observed network effects, we would expect

network effect to be largest for the types of summonses that directly impact owners’ costs. For

example, we expect to find a relatively large effect for hazardous driving summonses since they

may reflect more reckless driving and hence higher associated costs from accidents and

mechanical defects for the owner; and for trip sheet, vehicle condition, and missing items

summonses since owners receive a fine when drivers to whom they lease incur these summonses.

        These results are more speculative since we cannot identify precisely the level of moral

hazard associated with each summons type and because test power is significantly lower when

analyzing individual summons types. Nevertheless, the results in Table 7, which reports both

OLS and instrumental variables estimates, are generally consistent with effort effects.37 In-

network driving has the most significant effect on the three summons types that directly result in

an owner violation: trip record violations, vehicle condition violations, and missing item

violations. While the t-statistics for hazardous moving violations and for using the taxi unlawful

purposes, which may also directly generate costs for the owner, are smaller, they have the correct

sign, and the instrumental variables estimates are among the most negative.38

        For the reasons discussed in Section 3, we have focused our analysis on summonses.

However, we can also examine accidents and convictions for driving violations as alternative


37
   We do not include country fixed effects, nor country-level or within-driver estimates, since there is even less
power to identify these models when summons are broken out by type. The general patterns however appear similar.
38
   Results from t-tests and not coefficient estimates are reported since the baseline numbers of summonses across
types varies and hence are not directly comparable.

                                                                                                               34
driving outcomes, albeit with less power for tests, and without a panel data component since only

2005 outcomes are available. Accident rate in particular is an attractive measure because it

captures an outcome that affects owners directly.

       Columns (1)-(4) of Table 8 report results where the dependent variable is number of

accidents by the driver during the lease period. Columns (5)-(8) report results where the

dependent variable is number of convictions for driving violations. For each measure, we report

baseline OLS estimates, OLS estimates with fixed effects for driver country, country-level

estimates, and instrumental variables estimates. Reassuringly, all of the estimates have the

correct sign and a reasonable magnitude (although the country-level accident effect is somewhat

larger). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the effects of same-country leasing on accidents,

convictions, and summonses are all approximately proportional to their relative frequencies in

the data. The country-level and instrumental variables estimates, which are likely to isolate the

causal effect of in-network driving on driver effort, while imprecise, are again larger than the

OLS estimates, indicating an important network effect and also that in-network drivers are lower

ability on average than out-of-network drivers.

G.     Discussion of sample selection

       Given that we only have data on individuals who became drivers, but not on prospective

drivers not already in the industry, readers may wonder whether our findings are driven by some

sample selection bias (as distinct from selection into in-network driving conditional on being in

the sample). Specifically, given that our sample consists of drivers in the industry and not

prospective drivers, readers may wonder if the better outcomes among in-network drivers are

driven by high-quality prospective drivers being more likely to enter the industry as in-network

drivers, while low-quality prospective drivers not entering the industry at all. Such sample



                                                                                                    35
selection could potentially bias the driver-level cross-sectional results (OLS and 2SLS).

However, it is important to note that it would not drive the aggregate country-level results as

long as the sample selection process was the same across countries (because this selection within

country-of-birth will be averaged out at the country level), and it would not drive the within-

driver results (because all comparisons are within the same driver over time). Given the

robustness of our central findings across models that are, and are not, susceptible to sample

selection bias, we are confident that our results uncover a real causal effect. Moreover, all of our

strategies that account for selection (conditional on being in sample) indicate that the selection

into in-network driving is negative rather than positive, which is generally inconsistent with

sample selection driving our results.



                             7. EXPLORATION OF MECHANISMS

       The preceding section provides a range of evidence indicating that social ties between

owners and drivers lead to significantly better driving outcomes in the NYC taxi-leasing market.

However, as discussed in Section 4, there are at least five mechanisms through which social

networks can operate, including screening, monitoring costs, social sanctions, social preferences,

and social collateral, and we would like to know more about which mechanisms are important.

       First, we consider screening and monitoring costs. As discussed in Section 5, the

estimates of the effect of in-network driving from the country-level, within-driver, and

instrumental variables models are likely to reflect the true causal effect of in-network driving on

outcomes, while the estimates of the effect of in-network driving from the OLS model represent

both the causal effect of in-network driving and the effect of any selection of drivers into in-

network driving based on ability. Since the OLS estimates show a significantly smaller benefit of



                                                                                                     36
in-network driving versus the other estimates, we have evidence that selection leads to in-

network drivers having lower ability on average than out-of-network drivers. As the predictions

from the theoretical model in Section 4 indicates, under screening, there should be selection of

higher ability drivers into in-network leasing; while under no screening, there should be selection

of lower ability drivers into in-network leasing. Since in-network drivers appear to have lower

average ability than out-of-network drivers, screening is unlikely to be an important determinant

of driver-owner matches and outcomes.

         There are several reasons why monitoring costs are unlikely to explain the better in-

network driving outcomes. First, taxis are operated primarily in Manhattan and typically far from

the location of owners and members of the community (which are primarily in Brooklyn and

Queens), and hence direct monitoring of lessee driving is infeasible at reasonable cost regardless

of network status.39 Second, most drivers in the sample lease from an owner-driver who himself

regularly drives the taxi, giving the owner-driver some ability to regularly monitor vehicle

condition again regardless of network status.

         Second, we examine the effect of network density on driving outcomes to learn about

social sanctions, social collateral, and social preferences. Following Bertrand, Luttmer, and

Mullainathan (2000) and Gil and Hartman (2011), we use Census data on the density of residents

from a particular country in a neighborhood as a measure of the network strength among

residents from that neighborhood and country. Specifically, we measure driver/owner network

strength as the fraction of residents in the driver/owner Census tract from the same country of



39
  One might argue that other drivers from the same country could observe a driver’s driving style while on the road
and report this information to the owner. However, we believe this scenario is very unlikely because of the small
chance that any single driver while operating his taxi would observe another driver he knows exhibiting poor driving
style out of the approximately 40,000 drivers that are actively driving in the industry (short-term lessees, long-term
lessees, and owner-drivers), also happen to know the owner of that taxi, and be interested in reporting the observed
driving style to that owner.

                                                                                                                   37
birth. While this measure may not capture network strength completely, it nonetheless should

reflect the level of communication and ties between residents, for example, through the number

of community organizations and events. The idea is to test whether denser owner or driver social

networks generate larger improvements in outcomes, which may tell us about which mechanisms

are important.40

           Consider social sanctions, which would take the form of community-enforced

punishments against an offending group member. These social sanctions would most likely

operate through the owner’s network (and not a driver’s network) and hence a relatively dense

owner network is likely central to facilitating social sanctions. Social collateral could operate

similarly to social sanctions in that owners may provide or withhold favors to drivers based on

driving outcomes and these favors could operate through the owner’s network. Hence the effect

of social sanctions and possibly social collateral would be reflected in an owner network strength

effect. In contrast, social preferences would likely operate independently of an owner’s or

driver’s network.

           In Table 9 we report regression results where the dependent variable is a driver’s number

of summonses and the explanatory variables of interest are an indicator for in-network leasing

and the interaction of in-network leasing and network strength. Columns (1), (2), and (3) report

results driver network strength, owner network strength, and both, respectively. Comparing the

estimates of the interaction terms indicates that owner networks are far more important than

driver networks for generating good outcomes. This result can be seen most clearly in column

(4), where a stronger owner network leads to significantly better outcomes for in-network

drivers. Furthermore, driver network strength has no effect on summonses after conditioning on

                                                                                                                   38
owner network strength, and when fixed effects for driver country are included, the standalone

in-network effect approaches zero, suggesting that network effects rely in large part on the

density of the owner’s social network.41

         In columns (5)-(8), the continuous measure of network strength is replaced with an

indicator variable for whether at least 15 percent of residents in the owner/driver Census tract

have the same country of birth. The idea is that a minimum density of residents might be

necessary for a mechanism that operates through a local community to be effective, but that

increasingly dense networks have marginally smaller benefits. Indeed, results from this measure

are similar, but are now significantly more pronounced.42

         The result that network effects appear to operate in large part through owner networks

and not driver networks, and that the in-network effect is weak when the owner network is weak,

suggests that social sanctions may be driving the observed effort effects. Social collateral could

also play a role since there are ways in which social collateral could depend on owner network

strength.43 The limited stand-alone and driver network effects, however, are inconsistent with an

important role for social preferences.



                                        8. CONCLUDING REMARKS

         Moral hazard plays a central role in our understanding of numerous contractual

relationships, and researchers have found evidence consistent with moral hazard in many

contexts. However, much less is known about how one might mitigate moral hazard problems



41
   The number of observations varies slightly across specifications due to differences in the availability of addresses.
42
   Fifteen percent was chosen because it corresponds to the level at which the marginal effect of network density
appears to begin leveling off.
43
   One way that social sanctions and social collateral might operate is by making it easier for owners to collect
damages from drivers with bad outcomes since damages may often be identifiable but not legally recoverable.

                                                                                                                     39
where contract are necessarily incomplete. While there is some mixed evidence that social ties

can mitigate moral hazard problems in group lending schemes in developing countries, little is

known on the potential role of social ties in mitigating moral hazard outside of this particular

developing-country context.

        In this study we investigate the role of social networks in aligning the incentives of

economic agents in a United States labor market setting with incomplete contracts. Specifically,

we compare the driving outcomes of drivers who lease from owners from the same country of

birth to the driving outcomes of drivers who lease from owners from a different country of birth.

        We find that across three models that exploit three distinct plausibly exogenous sources

of variation to account for selection, drivers have better outcomes when driving in-network

versus out-of-network ─ indicative of a real causal effort effect. Consistent with social ties

reducing moral hazard, we find that these effects are largest for outcomes that impose a cost to

the owner. Also the marginal effects of driving in-network increase with the strength of the

owner network but not the driver network, and appear to be weak when the owner network is

weak. This is consistent with social sanctions, in the form of community-enforced punishments,

playing a primary role in facilitating the network effects.

        Given the prevalence of in-network driving and the strength of the observed network

effects in the taxi industry, our results indicate that social ties have incentive benefits in addition

to any positive selection effects. In many labor markets, jobs are frequently obtained through

referrals via social ties. It is commonly thought that the main benefit of these referrals is to

overcome asymmetric information over candidate quality. However, our results suggest these

referrals may also help to overcome the moral hazard problem. More generally, our findings

provide direct evidence that even in developed nations with strong institutions, social



                                                                                                     40
connections can play a valuable role in achieving better economic outcomes.

       Finally, an interesting policy implication of the literature on micro-credit group lending is

the possibility of introducing a joint liability program among groups of taxi drivers from the

same network when there is an insufficient number of in-network owners from whom to lease.

Given that responsibility for mechanical defects typically cannot be contractually assigned to any

single driver, and that the costs of bad outcomes like accidents often cannot be recovered from

individual drivers, group liability may induce a higher level of effort among these drivers and

allow more flexibility in which owners and drivers can optimally form business relationships.

      APPENDIX: SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS (FOR ONLINE REFERENCE ONLY)

Drivers leasing from a family member

         Previous work in the context of micro-credit group lending finds evidence that network

effects are weaker in groups where members have sufficiently close relationships, such as family

members, suggesting a breakdown of the social sanctions mechanism (Sharma and Zeller (1997),

Ahlin and Townsend (2007), and Karlan (2007) provide empirical evidence and Rai and

Sjostrom (2004) have a theoretical analysis). We examine this issue in the taxi industry by

comparing the outcomes of drivers who lease from a family member versus the outcomes of

drivers who lease in-network but not from a family member and drivers who lease out-of-

network. Family member are identified as drivers who are registered as leasing from an owner

with the same last name.44 The sample consists of 326 drivers who lease from a family member

(9 percent), 1,290 lessees who lease in-network but not from a family member (35 percent), and

2,085 lessees who lease out-of-network (56 percent). The categories are defined to be mutually

exclusive such that in-network and family member do not overlap.

         The regression results are provided in Table 10 and show that drivers leasing from a

family member have 0.13 and 0.10 fewer summons than out-of-network drivers versus non-

family in-network drivers having 0.08 and 0.08 fewer summons than out-of-network drivers,

depending on whether fixed effects for the driver’s country of birth are included. Thus, the

results suggest that family members have even better driving outcomes than non-family in-

network drivers, and that the effect of social ties is monotonic in the strength of that relationship,


44
  This method of identifying family members is imperfect: Drivers identified as family members are very likely to
actually be family members since sharing a last name with drivers operating the same taxi is unlikely to be
coincidental. However, some drivers who are family members may not be identified as such since drivers related to
owners by marriage, for example, would not have the same last name. Nevertheless, family members classified in
the data as non-family members are likely to represent only a small fraction of total lessees, and hence this
misclassification is unlikely to affect the results meaningfully (and if anything will bias the estimate of the family
effect towards zero).

                                                                                                                    51
although of course it is possible that the selection process by which drivers come to lease from a

family member versus a non-family member but same-country owner may differ in systematic

ways.

In-network drivers versus owner-drivers

        Table 11 shows how in-network lessees fare versus the owner-drivers from whom they

lease, both relative to out-of-network lessees. As expected, the owner-drivers show somewhat

better outcomes in terms of fewer summonses for driving violations. Note however that the

selection process based on ability by which drivers come to lease in-network versus become an

owner-driver may be very different, and hence a comparison of the magnitudes of these

estimates is only suggestive.

Alternative models and samples

        Table 12 reports results from the basic model of number of summons versus in-network

leasing, but uses alternative modeling functions, including a Poisson regression model and a

more flexible negative binomial regression model. Estimates for the later two models are

reported as marginal effects. The results are nearly identical. The estimates in Table 13 provide

results regarding the effects of in-network leasing for alternative samples. Columns (1)-(4)

provide results for the 2005 and 2007 samples individually, showing that the in-network leasing

effect appears robust to the sample period.
