Investment Dispersion and the Business Cycle

JEL No. E2,E22,E3,E32

                                            ABSTRACT

We document a new business cycle fact: the cross-sectional standard deviation of firm-level investment
(investment dispersion) is robustly and significantly procyclical. This makes investment dispersion
different from the dispersion of productivity and output growth, which is countercyclical. Investment
dispersion is more procyclical in the goods-producing sectors, for smaller firms and for structures.
We show that a heterogeneous-firm real business cycle model with countercyclical idiosyncratic firm
risk and non-convex adjustment costs calibrated to match moments of the long-run investment rate
distribution, produces a time series correlation coefficient between investment dispersion and aggregate
output of 0.58, close to the 0.45 in the data. We argue, more generally, that cross-sectional business
cycle dynamics impose tight empirical restrictions on the physical environments and the structural
parameters of heterogeneous-firm models.

1 Introduction

Investment at the micro level is lumpy and infrequent (Doms and Dunne, 1998, Cooper and
Haltiwanger, 2006). The distribution of investment rates is positively skewed and has excess
kurtosis (Caballero et al., 1995). Motivated by these facts about the long-run cross-sectional
distribution of micro-level investment, researchers have studied models with non-convex cap-
ital adjustment costs and asked whether “getting the micro facts right” matters for aggregate
(investment) dynamics.1
      In this paper we show that lumpy investment models have important and thus far unex-
plored implications for the dynamics of the cross-section of investment rates. Conversely, we
show that the joint dynamics of the cross-section of firm-level investment, output growth and
productivity growth provide important parameter restrictions for heterogeneous firm models.
      We start with the data and establish a new business cycle fact: the cross-sectional standard
deviation of firm-level investment rates is procyclical.2 Figure 1 and Table 1 on the next page
illustrate this new cross-sectional business cycle fact. The scatter plot reveals a positive corre-
lation between the cross-sectional investment rate dispersion and the cyclical component of
aggregate output.
      Relatedly, a recent literature has documented that, across different countries and data sets,
the dispersion of changes in firm- (or plant-) level output, productivity and prices is counter-
cyclical.3 We find the same negative association with the cycle also for the dispersion of firm-
level employment growth. Table 1 shows that the signs of the correlation between aggregate
output and the cross-sectional dispersion of core economic variables are statistically signifi-
cant at conventional levels (see Appendix A.2 for extensive robustness checks and a time series
graph of the investment rate dispersion).
      These findings together are incompatible with a simple frictionless model of the firm. Such a
physical environment implies that the distributions of firms’ decision variables comove over the
cycle. We propose a heterogenous-firm real business cycle model with fixed capital adjustment
costs to explain qualitatively and quantitatively the procyclicality of investment dispersion, even
when the dispersion of firm-level productivity growth is countercyclical.

     There is an ongoing debate in the literature about this issue: Gourio and Kashyap (2007) and Bachmann et al.
(2010) answer in the affirmative, Khan and Thomas (2008) negatively.

     Our main data source is the Deutsche Bundesbank balance sheet data base of German firms, USTAN. The lit-
erature has documented several related facts: Doms and Dunne (1998) show that between 1973 and 1988 the
Herfindahl index of U.S. plant-level manufacturing investment is positively correlated with aggregate investment.
Beaudry et al. (2001) show that cross-sectional investment dispersion between 1970 and 1990 in an unbalanced
panel of roughly 1,000 U.K. manufacturing plants is negatively correlated with conditional inflation volatility. Eis-
feldt and Rampini (2006) document that capital reallocation in U.S. Compustat data is procyclical.

Notes: the rows refer to the cross-sectional standard deviations, linearly detrended, of, respectively, the investment
rate, the log-change of real gross value added, the log-change of Solow residuals and the net employment change
rate, all at the firm level. We have removed firm fixed and 2-digit industry-year effects from each variable. The
first column shows the time series correlation coefficient with the cyclical component of the aggregate real gross
value added of the nonfinancial private business sector, detrended by an HP(100)-filter. The columns ‘5%’ and
‘95%’ refer to the top and bottom 5-percentiles in a parametric bootstrap of the correlation coefficient, using an
unrestricted VAR with one year lag (a nonparametric overlapping block bootstrap gives similar results).

   Fixed capital adjustment costs lead to nonlinear, two-step investment rules at the firm-level.
First, firms have a discrete decision whether to adjust or not to adjust (extensive margin). Sec-
ond, conditional on adjustment, firms decide by how much (intensive margin). The cross-
sectional investment dispersion is in general a complicated nonlinear function of both steps.
To fix ideas, eliminate the intensive margin decision and consider the case where firms can
only increase their capital stock by a given percentage or let it depreciate. In this case, both the
cross-sectional average and dispersion of investment are solely determined by how many firms
adjust. Average investment is increasing in the fraction of firms adjusting. And so is the disper-
sion of investment if less than half of the firms invest. Hence, as long as average investment is
procyclical, the cross-sectional investment dispersion is procyclical, too.
   Of course, in reality and in realistic quantitative models both the extensive and the intensive
margins of capital adjustment are operative and multiple shocks hit the economy. We calibrate
our model (i) to match the deviations from normality in the steady-state investment rate dis-
tribution, and (ii) to the observed joint stochastic process for aggregate Solow residuals and
firm-level productivity growth dispersions, and show in Section 5 that such a model can quan-
titatively match the procyclicality of investment dispersion in the data.
   This important result provides a new validation of the lumpy investment model. More gen-
erally, we argue that a fully fledged business cycle theory from the bottom up has to and can -
as we show - successfully speak to the dynamics of more than just the cross-sectional means of
the distributions underlying macroeconomic aggregates. We view this paper as a step towards
such a research program.
   Why is this direction of research important? Heterogenous-firm models have seen increased
use in the macroeconomic and international finance literature. This paper argues (see Sec-
tion 5) that cross-sectional dynamics impose tight restrictions on physical environments and
structural parameters in these models. For instance, we show that procyclical investment dis-
persion – generated by a procyclical extensive margin effect – requires curvature in the firm’s
revenue function, for this procyclical extensive margin effect to be quantitatively relevant. Only
with substantial curvature rely firms mostly on the extensive margin for capital adjustment, as
large investments would put the firm too far off its optimal scale of operation (see Gourio and
Kashyap (2007) for a related observation). We also argue that matching jointly the cyclicality of
the dispersion of investment and output growth restricts cyclical fluctuations in firm-level pro-
ductivity risk, which have been recently studied in a variety of models by Arellano et al. (2010),
Bloom et al. (2010), Chugh (2009), Gilchrist, Sim and Zakrajsek (2009) as well as Schaal (2010).
We finally show that general equilibrium price movements are crucial to match quantitatively
cross-sectional firm dynamics, a conjecture by Khan and Thomas (2008).




                                                 4
2 The Facts
When cross-sectional dispersion is concerned, Davis et al. (2006) show that studying only pub-
licly traded firms (Compustat) can lead to wrong conclusions. Therefore, we use the Deutsche
Bundesbank balance sheet data base of German firms, USTAN. USTAN is a private sector, an-
nual, firm-level data set that allows us to make use of 26 years of data (1973-1998), with cross-
sections that have, on average, over 30,000 firms per year. USTAN has a broader ownership, firm
size and industry coverage than the available comparable U.S. data sets from Compustat and
the Annual Survey of Manufacturers. This allows us to study industry and size differences in the
behavior of the cross-section of firms over the business cycle.4
      The evidence presented in the Introduction derived from the entire nonfinancial private
business sector, which includes firms that are in one of the following six 1-digit industries: agri-
culture, mining and energy, manufacturing, construction, trade, transportation and communi-
cation. This Section provides additional evidence that is highly suggestive of the mechanism
we exploit in this paper. 1) Across 2-digit industries there is a positive association between the
cyclicality of the extensive margin of investment and the cyclicality of the investment rate dis-
persion. 2) In the goods-producing sectors, like manufacturing and construction, where we
would expect non-convex capital adjustment to be most important, the investment rate dis-
persion is particularly procyclical. 3) The procyclicality of investment dispersion is declining
in firm size, consistent with the view that larger firms can partially outgrow adjustment costs.
4) Investment dispersion is less procyclical for equipment than it is for structures, which often
constitute by their very nature large and indivisible investment projects.
      For firm-level employment adjustment rates we use the symmetric adjustment rate defini-
                                                           ∆n i ,t
tion proposed in Davis et al. (1996),                0.5∗(n i ,t −1 +n i ,t ) ;   and, analogously, for firm-level investment
                 i i ,t
rates:   0.5∗(k i ,t +k i ,t +1 ) .   To compute firm-level Solow residuals, we start, in accordance with our
model in Section 3, from the following Cobb-Douglas production function:

                                                       y i ,t = z t ²i ,t k iθ,t n iν,t ,

where ²i ,t is firm-specific and z t aggregate productivity. We assume that labor input n i ,t is im-
mediately productive, whereas capital k i ,t is pre-determined and inherited from last period.
This difference is reflected in the different timing convention in the definitions of the invest-
ment and employment adjustment rates. We estimate the output elasticities of the production
factors, ν and θ, as median factor expenditures shares over gross value added within each in-
dustry.

    For details on the data set and the sample selection see Appendix A.1 as well as Bachmann and Bayer (2011).
See Appendix A.2 for evidence on the cyclical behavior of investment dispersion from the UK DTI and the U.S.
Compustat data bases.

                                                                       5
    We remove firm fixed and 2-digit industry-year effects from all four first-difference variables
in Table 1 to focus on idiosyncratic changes. We thus eliminate differences in industry-specific
responses to aggregate shocks as well as permanent ex-ante and predictable heterogeneity be-
tween firms.
    We combine these firm-level data with annual national accounting data from Germany
(VGR) on gross value added, investment, capital and employment from two-digit industries.
We use these same VGR data to compute aggregate and industry-level Solow residuals.
    We start by showing that across 2-digit industries there is a positive association between
the procyclicality of investment dispersion and the procyclicality of the extensive margin of
investment. Figure 2 shows on the x-axis the correlation coefficients of the investment rate
dispersion with the cyclical component of own-industry output.

Notes: the x-axis displays the correlation coefficient between the investment rate dispersion (linearly detrended)
and the business cycle frequency component of 2-digit industry real gross value added. The y-axis displays the
same correlation coefficient for the extensive margin (linearly detrended), i.e. the fraction of adjusters (‘Frac. of
                                             i i ,t
adj.’) with an investment rate of | 0.5(k                       | > 0.01 (see Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) for this convention).

Larger dots represent 1-digit industries, smaller ones 2-digit industries. The acronyms mean: ‘AGR’ (agriculture),

                                                                        6
        On the y-axis Figure 2 displays the correlation coefficients of the fraction of adjusters with
the same output measure. Using the convention in Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), we define
“adjusters” as those firms with annual investment rates of absolute value larger than 1%.5
        Table 2 provides numbers on how the dispersion of investment and Solow residual growth
as well as the fraction of (“lumpy”) adjusters comove with output across one-digit industries.
It shows that investment dispersion and the extensive margin of investment are strongly pro-
cyclical in the goods-producing sectors, manufacturing in particular. Trade exhibits lower pro-
cyclicality, while in the primary sectors the cross-section of firm-level investment is by and
large acyclical. To put these findings in perspective, we also display the cyclicality of the cross-
sectional Solow residual growth dispersion, which is strongly countercyclical in manufactur-
ing and trade. Manufacturing, an industry the literature has focused on to find evidence for
non-convex adjustment technologies (Doms and Dunne, 1998, Caballero and Engel, 1999, and
Cooper and Haltiwanger, 2006), exhibits the most countercyclically disperse productivity growth
as well as the most procyclical investment dispersion.

Notes: see notes to Table 1 and Figure 2. The table displays correlation coefficients of four cross-sectional variables
(in columns 2-5) with the cyclical component of aggregate real gross value added of the nonfinancial private busi-
ness sector in the first row, thereafter with the real gross value added of the corresponding 1-digit industry. The
fraction of lumpy adjusters (‘Frac. of lumpy adj.’) is defined as the fraction of firms with an investment rate of:
           i i ,t
| 0.5(k                       | > 0.2 (see Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) for this convention). The latter is linearly detrended.

        Table 3 shows the cyclicality of investment dispersion by firm size, according to three dif-
ferent size criteria: employment, value added and capital. Just as for the aggregate numbers
in Table 1 we use the cyclical component of the aggregate output of the private nonfinancial
    5
   This positive association is robust to using the fraction of lumpy investors – with investment rates larger than
20% or 10% in absolute value – or the fraction of lumpy investors with positive investment rates. It is also ro-
bust to using the nonfinancial private business sector’s aggregate output as a cyclical indicator, although owing to
industry-specific components in the industry cycles this association is somewhat weaker.



                                                                                         7
business sector as the cyclical indicator. We find procyclical investment dispersion mainly for
the smaller firms, especially when size is measured by employment or value added. The very
large firms, in contrast, have an almost acyclical investment dispersion. This distinction is sta-
tistically significant in the sense that if size is measured in terms of employment or value added,
neither the point estimate for the smallest size class lies in the [5%, 95%]−bands of the largest
size class nor vice versa.

with the cyclical component of the aggregate real gross value added of the private nonfinancial business sector.


    This is at least consistent with the view that larger firms can smooth the effects of non-
convex capital adjustment costs and the extensive margin over several production units. Ta-
bles 2 and 3 also show that, while there is considerable variation in cross-sectional dynamics
across industries and firm sizes, our main empirical result that investment dispersion is pro-
cyclical is not driven by one large industry or the very large firms. We also find no evidence that
a large industry or the large firms have procyclical Solow residual growth dispersions, in which
case they could generate procyclical investment dispersion without any frictions (Bachmann
and Bayer (2011) documents this in more detail).

Notes: see notes to Table 1. The table displays correlation coefficients of the investment rate dispersion by
type of capital good with the linearly detrended cross-sectional average investment rate by type of capital good:
               i i ,t
mean( 0.5∗(k                       ).
               i ,t +k i ,t +1 )




    Finally, Table 4 shows the cyclicality of investment dispersion by type of capital good. Since
the average investment rate for structures is not very correlated with the overall business cy-
cle, we now use the linearly detrended cross-sectional average investment rate for equipment
and structures, respectively, as cyclical indicator. We find that the investment dispersion of

                                                                 8
structures is almost perfectly correlated with the cycle in aggregate structural investment. We
interpret this as evidence that the extensive margin effect on cross-sectional investment disper-
sion is larger for structures, consistent with the available evidence that investment in structures
is subject to higher fixed adjustment costs (see Caballero and Engel, 1999).
   Altogether, we view the evidence gathered in this section as at least suggestive that non-
convex capital adjustment costs have a role to play in explaining procyclical investment dis-
persion. We show next that quantitatively realistic fixed capital adjustment costs can indeed
generate procyclical investment dispersion, in the magnitude observed in the data.



3 The Model
Our model follows closely the real business cycle models in Khan and Thomas (2008) as well
as Bachmann et al. (2010). The main departure from either paper is that we introduce a sec-
ond aggregate shock, namely to the the standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
Such a shock is a convenient way to generate the observed countercyclicality of the dispersion
of firm value added growth. Moreover, it is required by the quantitative nature of our exercise,
as we will show that without it, even for very small fixed costs of capital adjustment, the ex-
tensive margin effect is so strong that the business cycle and investment dispersion are almost
perfectly correlated.



3.1 Firms
The economy consists of a unit mass of small firms. There is one commodity in the economy
that can be consumed or invested. Each firm produces this commodity, employing its pre-
determined capital stock (k) and labor (n), according to the following Cobb-Douglas decreasing-
returns-to-scale production function (θ > 0, ν > 0, θ + ν < 1):

                                             y = z²k θ n ν ,                                    (1)

where z and ² denote aggregate and idiosyncratic revenue productivity, respectively.
   The idiosyncratic log productivity process is first-order Markov with autocorrelation ρ ² and
a time-varying conditional standard deviation, σ(²). The trend deviation of the natural log-
arithm of aggregate productivity and σ(²) evolve jointly according to an unrestricted VAR(1)
process, with normal innovations v that have zero mean and covariance Ω:
                              Ã                  !          Ã                !
                                   log z 0                      log z
                                                     = %A                        + v,           (2)
                               σ(²00 ) − σ̄(²)              σ(²0 ) − σ̄(²)

                                                        9
      where σ̄(²) denotes the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
We make a timing assumption that gives shocks to σ(²) the interpretation of uncertainty shocks:
firms today observe the standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks tomorrow.6 The
shocks to the exogenous aggregate states, v, and idiosyncratic productivity shocks are indepen-
dent. Idiosyncratic productivity shocks are independent across productive units. In contrast,
we do not impose any restrictions on Ω or % A ∈ R2×2 .
      We denote the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity by (1 − θ)(γ − 1), so that aggregate
output and capital grow at rate γ − 1 along the balanced growth path. From now on we work
with k and y (and later aggregate consumption, C ) in efficiency units.
      Each period a firm draws its current cost of capital adjustment, 0 ≤ ξ ≤ ξ̄, which is denom-
inated in units of labor, from a time-invariant distribution, G. G is a uniform distribution on
[0, ξ̄], common to all firms. Draws are independent across firms and over time, and employ-
ment is freely adjustable.
      Upon investment, i , the firm incurs a fixed cost of ωξ, where ω is the current real wage.
Capital depreciates at rate δ. We can then summarize the evolution of the firm’s capital stock
(in efficiency units) between two consecutive periods, from k to k 0 , as follows:

                                               Fixed cost paid           γk 0
                                  i 6= 0:              ωξ            (1 − δ)k + i
                                  i = 0:                0              (1 − δ)k

      Given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, it is sufficient to describe differences across
firms and their evolution by the distribution of firms over (², k). We denote this distribution by
µ. Thus, z, σ(²0 ), µ constitutes the current aggregate state and µ evolves according to the law
         ¡           ¢

of motion µ0 = Γ(z, σ(²0 ), µ), which firms take as given.
      To summarize: at the beginning of a period, a firm is characterized by its pre-determined
capital stock, its idiosyncratic productivity, and its capital adjustment cost. Given the aggregate
state, it decides its employment level, n, production and depreciation occurs, workers are paid,
and investment decisions are made. Then the period ends.
      Next we describe the dynamic programming problem of a firm. We will take two shortcuts
(details can be found in Khan and Thomas, 2008). We state the problem in terms of utils of the
representative household (rather than physical units), and denote the marginal utility of con-
sumption by p = p z, σ(²0 ), µ . Also, given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, continuation
                  ¡           ¢

values can be expressed without future adjustment costs.
  6
    We have experimented with the other timing assumption, where σ(²) and z are jointly observed. The quantita-
tive differences are small. Investment dispersion tends to be slightly more procyclical under this alternative timing
assumption.



                                                         10
   Let V 1 (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), µ) denote the expected discounted value - in utils - of a firm that is in
idiosyncratic state (², k, ξ), given the aggregate state (z, σ(²0 ), µ). Then the firm’s expected value
prior to the realization of the adjustment cost draw is given by:

                                                    Z     ξ̄
                           0               0
                         V (², k; z, σ(² ), µ) =               V 1 (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), µ)G(d ξ).     (3)
                                                      0

With this notation the dynamic programming problem becomes:

                 V 1 (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), µ) = max{CF + max(Vno adj , max[−AC + Vadj ])},             (4)
                                                n                                  k0

where CF denotes the firm’s flow value, Vno adj the firm’s continuation value if it chooses inaction
and does not adjust, and Vadj the continuation value, net of adjustment costs AC , if the firm
adjusts its capital stock. That is:

                            CF = [z²k θ n ν − ω(z, σ(²0 ), µ)n]p(z, σ(²0 ), µ),                      (5a)
                        Vno adj = βE[V 0 (²0 , (1 − δ)k/γ; z 0 , σ(²00 ), µ0 )],                     (5b)
                            AC = ξω(z, σ(²0 ), µ)p(z, σ(²0 ), µ),                                    (5c)
                           Vadj = −i p(z, σ(²0 ), µ) + βE[V 0 (²0 , k 0 ; z 0 , σ(²00 ), µ0 )],      (5d)

where both expectation operators average over next period’s realizations of the aggregate and
idiosyncratic shocks, conditional on this period’s values, and we recall that i = γk 0 − (1 − δ)k.
The discount factor, β, reflects the time preferences of the representative household.
   Taking as given ω(z, σ(²0 ), µ) and p(z, σ(²0 ), µ), and the law of motion µ0 = Γ(z, σ(²0 ), µ), the
firm chooses optimally labor demand, whether to adjust its capital stock at the end of the pe-
riod, and the optimal capital stock, conditional on adjustment. This leads to policy functions:
N = N (², k; z, σ(²0 ), µ) and K = K (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), µ). Since capital is pre-determined, the optimal
employment decision is independent of the current adjustment cost draw.



3.2 Households

We assume a continuum of identical households that have access to a complete set of state-
contingent claims. Hence, there is no heterogeneity across households. They own shares in
the firms and are paid dividends. We do not need to model the household side in detail (see
Khan and Thomas (2008) for that), we just use the first-order conditions that determine the
equilibrium wage and the marginal utility of consumption.



                                                               11
      Households have a standard felicity function in consumption and labor:7

                                                U (C , N h ) = logC − AN h ,                                                        (6)

where C denotes consumption and N h the household’s labor supply. Households maximize the
expected present discounted value of the above felicity function. By definition we have:

                                                                                         1
                                       p(z, σ(²0 ), µ) ≡ UC (C , N h ) =                           ,                                (7)
                                                                                  C (z, σ(²0 ), µ)

and from the intratemporal first-order condition:

                                                            U N (C , N h )       A
                                     ω(z, σ(²0 ), µ) = −                   =               .                                        (8)

         omy, µ0 = Γ(z, σ(²0 ), µ), is induced by K (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), µ) and the exogenous processes for
         z, σ(²0 ) as well as ².

   Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 define an equilibrium given Γ, while step 5 specifies the equilibrium
condition for Γ.



3.4 Solution

It is is well-known that (4) is not computable, because µ is infinite dimensional. We follow
Krusell and Smith (1997, 1998) and approximate the distribution, µ, by its first moment over
capital, k̄, and its evolution, Γ, by a simple log-linear rule. In the same vein, we approximate the
equilibrium pricing function by a log-linear rule, discrete aggregate state by discrete aggregate
state:

                                   log k¯0 =a k z, σ(²0 ) + b k z, σ(²0 ) log k̄,
                                               ¡         ¢     ¡         ¢
                                                                                                      (9a)
                                    log p =a p z, σ(²0 ) + b p z, σ(²0 ) log k̄,
                                               ¡         ¢     ¡         ¢
                                                                                                      (9b)

Given (8), we do not have to specify an equilibrium rule for the real wage. As usual with the
Krusell and Smith procedure, we posit the log-linear forms (9a)–(9b) and check that in equilib-
rium they yield a good fit to the actual law of motion.
   Substituting k̄ for µ into (4) and using (9a)–(9b), (4) becomes a computable dynamic pro-
gramming problem with policy functions N = N (², k; z, σ(²0 ), k̄) and K = K (², k, ξ; z, σ(²0 ), k̄). We
solve this problem by value function iteration on V 0 . We do so by applying multivariate spline
techniques that allow for a continuous choice of capital when the firm adjusts.
   With these policy functions, we can then simulate a model economy without imposing the
equilibrium pricing rule (9b). Rather, we impose market-clearing conditions and solve for the
pricing kernel at every point in time of the simulation. We simulate the model economy for a
large number of time periods. This generates a time series of {p t } and {k̄ t } endogenously, on
which the assumed rules (9a)–(9b) can be updated with a simple OLS regression. The proce-
dure stops when the updated coefficients a k z, σ(²0 ) to b p z, σ(²0 ) are sufficiently close to the

4 Calibration
The model period is a year. This corresponds to the data frequency in USTAN. Most firm-level
data sets that are based on balance sheet data are of that frequency. The following parameters
then have standard values: β = 0.98 and δ = 0.094, which we compute from German national
accounting data for the nonfinancial private business sector. Given this depreciation rate, we
pick γ = 1.014, in order to match the time-average aggregate investment rate in the nonfinancial
private business sector: 0.108. γ = 1.014 is also consistent with German long-run growth rates.
The disutility of work parameter, A, is chosen to generate an average time spent at work of 0.33:
A = 2. We set the output elasticities of labor and capital to ν = 0.5565 and θ = 0.2075, respec-
tively, which correspond to the measured median labor and capital shares in manufacturing in
the USTAN data base.8
      We measure the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks as σ̄(²) =
0.1201. Since idiosyncratic productivity shocks in the data also exhibit above-Gaussian kur-
tosis - 4.4480 on average -, and since the fixed adjustment costs parameters will be identi-
fied by the kurtosis of the firm-level investment rate (together with its skewness), we want to
avoid attributing excess kurtosis in the firm-level investment rate to lumpy investment, when
the idiosyncratic driving force itself has excess kurtosis. We incorporate the measured excess
kurtosis into the discretization process for the idiosyncratic productivity state by using a mix-
ture of two Gaussian distributions: N (0, 0.0777) and N (0, 0.1625) - the standard deviations are
0.1201 ± 0.0424, with a weight of 0.4118 on the first distribution. Finally, we set ρ ² = 0.95.
This process is discretized on a 19−state-grid, using Tauchen’s (1986) procedure with mixed
Gaussian normals. Heteroskedasticity in the idiosyncratic productivity process is modeled with
time-varying transition matrices between idiosyncratic productivity states, where the matrices
correspond to different values of σ(²0 ).
      To calibrate the parameters of the two-state aggregate shock process we estimate a bivariate,
unrestricted VAR with the linearly detrended natural logarithm of the aggregate Solow residual9
and the linearly detrended σ(²0 )-process from the USTAN data. The parameters of this VAR
are:10                              Ã                     !         Ã              !

This process is discretized on a [5 × 5]−state grid, using a bivariate analog of Tauchen’s proce-
dure.

     If one views the DRTS assumption as a mere stand-in for a CRTS production function with monopolistic com-
petition, than these choices would correspond to an employment elasticity of the underlying production function

of 0.7284 and a markup of θ+ν   = 1.31. The implied capital elasticity of the revenue function, 1−ν  is 0.47.

     We use ν = 0.5565 and θ = 0.2075 in these calculations.

     With a slight abuse of notation, but for the sake of readability, Ω has standard deviations on the main diagonal
and correlations on the off diagonal.

      Given the aforementioned set of parameters β, δ, γ, A, ν, θ, % A , Ω, σ̄(²), ρ ² , we calibrate the
adjustment costs parameter, ξ̄, to minimize a quadratic form in the normalized differences be-
tween the time-average firm-level investment rate skewness produced by the model and the
data, as well as the time-average firm-level investment rate kurtosis:11

As can be seen from (11), the distribution of firm-level investment rates exhibits both substan-
tial positive skewness – 2.1920 – as well as excess kurtosis – 20.0355. Caballero et al. (1995)
document a similar fact for U.S. manufacturing plants. They also argue that non-convex capital
adjustment costs are an important ingredient to explain such a strongly non-Gaussian distri-
bution, given a close-to-Gaussian shock process. With fixed adjustment costs, firms have an
incentive to lump their investment activity together over time in order to economize on these
adjustment costs. Therefore, typical capital adjustments are large, which creates excess kurto-
sis. Making use of depreciation, firms can adjust their capital stock downward without paying
adjustment costs. This makes negative investments less likely and hence leads to positive skew-
ness in firm-level investment rates. We therefore use the skewness and kurtosis of firm-level
investment rates to identify ξ̄.

Notes: ‘BL’ denotes the baseline calibration. Skewness and kurtosis refer to the time-average of the corresponding

    The normalization constants in (11) are, respectively, the time series standard deviation of the cross-sectional
investment rate skewness and the time series standard deviation of the cross-sectional investment rate kurtosis in
the data.

    Table 5 shows that ξ̄ is indeed identified in this calibration strategy, as cross-sectional skew-
ness and kurtosis of the firm-level investment rates are monotonically increasing in ξ̄. The min-
imum of Ψ is achieved for ξ̄ = 0.25, which constitutes our baseline case. This implies average
costs conditional on adjustment equivalent to roughly 13% of annual firm-level value added,
which is in line with estimates from the U.S. (see Bloom (2009), Table IV, for an overview).



5 Results

5.1 Baseline Results
Can a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with persistent idiosyncratic productivity
shocks, countercyclical aggregate shocks to their dispersion and fixed capital adjustment costs,
calibrated to the long-run non-Gaussianity of the investment rate distribution, reproduce the
cyclicality of important cross-sectional dispersion measures? Table 6 says “yes”. The model
matches the cyclicality of the dispersion of firm-level investment rates, of value added growth
and of employment growth as well as the cyclicality of the extensive margin reasonably well.12

    A basic, albeit only partial intuition why lumpy capital adjustment is a suitable candidate to
explain procyclical investment dispersion, can be gleaned from a simple Ss-model as in Caplin
and Spulber (1987):




  12
     Figure 4 in Appendix A.2 shows a simulated time path of investment dispersion from the baseline model that
displays positive comovement with aggregate output.

Proposition:
    In a one-sided Ss-model with a fixed optimal adjustment policy (conditional on adjustment),
                                                                                        ∆k
S − s, and where the fraction of adjusters is given by                                  S−s
                                                                                            ,    the variance of adjustments increases
with average adjustment if and only if the fraction of adjusters is smaller than 0.5.
Proof: Average adjustment in this environment ³ is obviously

                                                   ∆k
                                                                    ¢2 ∆k
variance of adjustment is given by: (0 − ∆k) 1 − S−s + (S − s) − ∆k S−s
                                            2
                                                                             = ∆k(S − s − ∆k),
                                                            ∆k
which is increasing in ∆k if and only if                    S−s
                                                                  < 0.5.

    This example shows that with sufficient inertia procyclical investment dispersion is gener-
ated by a procyclical extensive margin, as in this simple model all aggregate dynamics are driven
by the extensive margin. The intensive margin of adjustment, S − s, is fixed by assumption. Of
course, this example is rather stylized and our quantitative model has both an extensive and an
intensive margin of investment operating and two aggregate shocks hitting the economy.
    To investigate the mechanism quantitatively, Table 7 displays the cyclicality of the invest-
ment rate and output growth dispersions that our model generates for various levels of adjust-
ment costs, both with and without shocks to the dispersion of productivity growth.

                                                                           i ,t +k i ,t +1 )

                                                                          17
      Two findings are important: the third and last column of Table 7 show that without second
moment shocks neither the procyclicality of the investment dispersion nor the countercycli-
cality of the output growth dispersion can be quantitatively replicated. Already a very small
non-convex capital adjustment cost generates procyclical investment dispersion – the gradient
of procyclicality in the adjustment cost factor, ξ̄, is steep. The model overshoots the number in
the data considerably. Also, without countercyclical second moment shocks the dispersion of
value added growth is essentially acyclial. Countercyclical second moment shocks are thus an
important part in understanding cross-sectional firm dynamics.
      Secondly, in the presence of countercyclical second moment shocks, the procyclicality of
investment dispersion is a gradually and monotonically increasing function of the adjustment
cost parameter. What is perhaps surprising is that the same level of adjustment costs that best
matches the time average of the cross-sectional skewness and kurtosis of firm-level investment
rates - two statistics closely related to the extent of non-convexities at the micro-level as we have
explained in Section 4 - also makes the model match almost exactly the extent of procyclicality
of investment dispersion in the data, as measured by its correlation coefficient with the cyclical
component of output.
      By contrast, in the frictionless case, ξ̄ = 0, the dispersions of investment and output growth
merely mirror the countercyclicality of the dispersion of the idiosyncratic driving force, namely
idiosyncratic productivity. As the output growth dispersion is slightly too countercyclical for
ξ̄ = 0, incidentally, non-convex capital adjustment costs help to align model and data also in
this dimension.
      We view these results as a good validation of our mechanism and an example of the larger
premise of this paper that cross-sectional dynamics are an important aspect of the data that
heterogeneous firm models should address. In the presence of quantitatively realistic coun-
tercyclicality in the dispersion of firm-level Solow residual shocks, it is one level of adjustment
costs that jointly matches the time-average skewness and kurtosis of the investment rate distri-
bution and the time series correlation between the standard deviation of investment rates and
aggregate output. Moreover, such a model replicates the cyclicality of the cross-sectional dis-
persions of other important firm-level quantities. Table 7 shows that this identification is rather
tight.
      Table 8 illustrates how the procyclicality of the investment dispersion and the procyclical-
                                                                                         θ

and of the investment rate dispersion. With larger revenue elasticities or “closer to” linear pro-
duction functions, the intensive margin of investment is more flexible and thus more used to
adjust the firm-level capital stock (see Gourio and Kashyap, 2007). In long model simulations,
the range of the target levels of capital that firms adjust to is the wider the closer the revenue
elasticity of capital is to unity. In the baseline scenario the target levels of capital range from
0.0241 to 42.0646. They span, for the third column, 0.0180 to 99.7068, and 0.0072 to 177.4022
for the last column. Note that all three cases have the same process for idiosyncratic productiv-
ity.

Notes: see notes to Tables 6. ‘GE’ stands for general equilibrium and refers to a model simulation with market
clearing real wages and interest rates. ‘PE’ stands for partial equilibrium and refers to a model simulation, where
the real wage and interest rate are held constant at the average level in the ‘GE’-simulation.


       Table 9 shows the effect of general equilibrium on the procyclicality of the extensive mar-
gin and the cross-sectional investment rate dispersion. It is real wage and interest rate move-
ments that lead to coordination of micro-level adjustment and therefore, to the extent that this
is done mainly through the extensive margin, to procyclicality of the fraction of adjusters. A
more procyclical extensive margin increases the cyclical comovement of the investment rate
dispersion. Since both cross-sectional moments are strongly procyclical in the data, we thus
provide a first confirmation of the conjecture in Khan and Thomas (2008) that general equi-

Notes: see notes to Table 6. For the ‘Double Volatility of st d (∆ log ²i ,t )’-case, we use the data time series of
st d (∆ log ²i ,t ) multiplied by a factor 2 to reestimate the aggregate shock process (2) and recompute the equilib-
rium with an otherwise unaltered model specification. For the ‘Quadruple Volatility of st d (∆ log ²i ,t )’-case, we
multiply by a factor of 4.


    With the final Table 10 we argue that it is important to match the cyclicality of the invest-
ment and the output growth dispersions jointly, and that the procyclicality of investment dis-
persion places tight bounds on the volatility of the second-moment shocks. If we increase this
volatility and make second moment shocks “more important”, the procyclicality of investment
dispersion is eliminated rather quickly.
    In summary, both the procyclicality of investment dispersion as well as the countercycli-
cality of the dispersion of firm-level value added growth imposes rather tight restrictions on
important structural parameters, such as adjustment costs, factor elasticities in the production
function and the volatility of second moment shocks. This makes the study of cross-sectional
business cycle dynamics important for the calibration of heterogenous-firm models. We also
show that the nature of the aggregate environment - market clearing with flexible prices or not
- and cross-sectional business cycle dynamics are linked and should be jointly used to disci-
pline models.


5.2 Results from Industry Calibrations
We next use the one-digit industry variation in the procyclicality of investment dispersion and
the extensive margin depicted in Figure 2 in Section 2 and check whether the model can gener-
ate a similar variation. Instead of calibrating and computing a six-industry general equilibrium
model of the entire German economy, which would be computationally too burdensome, we
run six variants of our baseline model, where we adjust the important parameters to industry-
specific moments, but otherwise treat the corresponding industry as if it was the aggregate
economy. With this caveat in mind, we view this exercise as a useful additional test for the
extensive margin mechanism and its effect on cross-sectional dynamics.

      Specifically, we calibrate the factor elasticities in the production function to the median in-
dustry income shares in USTAN and use the industry cuts from USTAN to compute the long-run
average and the time series process of the standard deviations of the firm-level Solow residual
shocks. We calibrate the depreciation rates to match the industry-specific long-run aggregate
investment rate from German national accounting data. The industry national accounting data
also allow us to compute industry-specific Solow residuals and then reestimate the VAR in equa-
tion (2). Finally, just as in the baseline calibration, we calibrate the adjustment costs parameter,
ξ̄, to minimize a quadratic form in industry-specific skewness and kurtosis of the firm-level
investment rates, analogous to (11).14

      Table 11 displays the results for the correlations of investment dispersion and the extensive
margin with own-industry output.15 The correlation coefficients between model simulations
and data are 0.471 for the investment rate dispersion and 0.901 for the extensive margin. The
corresponding rank correlations are 0.4 and 0.9, respectively. The model captures the overall
variation rather well, with mining and energy not displaying any cyclicality of either investment
rate dispersion or the extensive margin, transportation and communication taking up a middle
position and manufacturing and construction having the strongest procyclicality. The biggest
exception is trade, where the model produces an almost perfect procyclicality of investment

    For computational reasons we leave out agriculture, for which we estimate a revenue elasticity of capital of
0.935. This would require extremely fine and large grids for firm-level capital. Given this low curvature of the
firm’s revenue function and our results in Table 8 from Section 5.1, the slightly negative correlation of investment
dispersion in agriculture supports the extensive margin mechanism ex negativo, making the cumbersome compu-
tation unnecessary. For similar reasons, in the computation for the mining and energy sector we scale down the
measured factor elasticities by a factor of 0.9.


                                                                  21
rate dispersion and the extensive margin, which is inconsistent with the data. We estimate the
revenue elasticity of capital for trade to be 0.403, the lowest value for any of the six one-digit
industries. This low curvature facilitates the extensive margin mechanism to an extent that
is obviously at odds with the data. We nevertheless view the industry-specific results overall
as additional support for the extensive margin mechanism and its relation to cross-sectional
dynamics, although, clearly, other things are going on, too.



6 Final Remarks
This paper establishes a new business cycle fact: the cross-sectional standard deviation of
firm-level investment is robustly and significantly procyclical. Investment dispersion is more
procyclical in the goods-producing sectors, for smaller firms and for structures. This paper
also shows that important structural parameters such as capital adjustment costs, the curva-
ture of the firms’ revenue function or the heteroskedasticity of the firm-level productivity pro-
cess have important implications for the dynamics of the cross-section of firms. This means,
conversely, that cross-sectional dynamics should be used in the calibration and evaluation of
heterogeneous-firm models. In such models the nature of the aggregate environment - mar-
ket clearing with flexible prices or not - and cross-sectional business cycle dynamics are tightly
linked and should be jointly used as a disciplining device.
   We view this paper as just the beginning of a new research program that attempts to un-
derstand more comprehensively the time-series behavior of the entire cross-section of firms,
not merely the cyclicality of second moments. This will, hopefully, lead to a better microfoun-
dation and identification of structural heterogeneous-firm models and contribute to making
them better suitable for policy analysis.

A Appendix - Data

A.1 Description of the Sample
Our firm-level data source is USTAN (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) of Deutsche Bundesbank,
which is a large annual firm-level balance sheet data base. It provides annual firm level data
from 1971 to 1998 from the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of over 60,000 firms
per year. It originated as a by-product of the Bundesbank’s rediscounting and lending activities.
Bundesbank law required the Bundesbank to assess the creditworthiness of all parties backing
a commercial bill put up for discounting. It implemented this regulation by requiring balance
sheet data of all parties involved. These balance sheet data were then archived and collected
into a database (see Stoess (2001) and von Kalckreuth (2003) for details).
   Although the sampling design – one’s commercial bill being put up for discounting – does
not lead to a perfectly representative selection of firms in a statistical sense, the coverage of the
sample is very broad. USTAN covers incorporated firms as well as privately-owned companies.
Its industry coverage – while still somewhat biased towards manufacturing firms – includes the
construction, the service as well as the primary sectors. The following Table 12 displays the
industry coverage of our final baseline sample.


                                  Table 12: I NDUSTRY C OVERAGE

           Mining & Energy                                 4,165                 0.49
           Manufacturing                                 405,787                47.50
           Construction                                   54,569                 6.39
           Trade (Retail & Wholesale)                    355,208                41.59
           Transportation & Communication                 22,085                 2.59



   While there remains a bias towards larger and financially healthier firms, the size coverage
is still fairly broad: 31% of all firm-year observations in our final baseline sample have less than
20 employees and 57% have less than 50 employees. In terms of ownership structure, only 2%
of firm-year observations are from publicly traded firms, just under 60% from limited liability
companies and just under 40% from private firms with fully liable partners. Finally, the Bun-
desbank itself frequently uses the USTAN data for its macroeconomic analyses and for cross-
checking national accounting data. We take this as an indication that the bank considers the
data as sufficiently representative and of high quality. This makes the USTAN data a suitable
data source for the study of cross-sectional business cycle dynamics.


                                                 26
   From the original USTAN data, we select only firms that report information on payroll, gross
value added (before depreciation) and capital stocks. Moreover, we drop observations from East
German firms to avoid a break of the series in 1990. We deflate all but the capital and investment
data by the implicit deflator for gross value added from the German national accounts.
   Capital is deflated with one-digit industry- and capital-good specific investment good price
deflators within a perpetual inventory method. Similarly, we recover the amount of labor inputs
from wage bills (we calculate an average wage for cells of firms described by industry, year, firm-
size, and region and then divide the payroll by this average), as information on the number
of employees is only updated infrequently for some companies. Finally, the firm-level Solow
residual is calculated from data on real gross value added and factor inputs.
   We remove outliers according to the following procedure: we calculate log changes in real
gross value added, the Solow residual, real capital and employment, as well as the firm-level
investment rate and drop all observations where a change falls outside a three standard devia-
tions interval around the year-specific mean. We also drop those firms for which we do not have
at least five observations in first differences. This leaves us with a sample of 854,105 firm-year
observations, which corresponds to observations on 72,853 firms, i.e. the average observation
length of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years. The average number of firms in the cross-section of
any given year is 32,850. Details on the implementation as well as the representativeness of the
resulting sample can be found in Bachmann and Bayer (2011).




                                                27
A.2 Robustness
We start by showing in Table 13 that the cross-sectional averages of investment as well as out-
put, productivity and employment growth, computed from USTAN, are strongly positively cor-
related with the cyclical component of the real gross value added of the nonfinancial private
business sector. This means that USTAN represents well the cyclical behavior of the sectoral
aggregate it is meant to represent.

                           mean(∆ log ²i ,t )                                                  0.592

Notes: the table shows the time series correlation coefficient of cross-sectional averages, linearly detrended, with
the cyclical component of the aggregate real gross value added of the nonfinancial private business sector, which
we detrend using an HP(100)-filter. The rows refer, respectively, to the investment rate, the log-change of real gross
value added, the log-change of Solow residuals and the net employment change rate. We have removed firm fixed
and 2-digit industry-year effects from each variable.


    The next two tables provide robustness checks for our main empirical result that the cross-
sectional investment rate dispersion is procyclical. We start by varying the cyclical indicator in
Table 14, while Table 15 deals with robustness related to the choice and treatment of the cross-
sectional dispersion measure as well as robustness with respect to general data treatment.

all firms with 2.5 (instead of 3) standard deviations above or below the year-specific mean in either Solow residual
growth, value added growth, investment rates or employment change rates. The next two rows explore two more
liberal outlier removal criteria. ‘Outlier removal - 1% largest’ refers to a scenario, where observations are removed
if they belong to the smallest or to the largest 1% of the observations in a given year. The next row applies a 5% cri-
terion. ‘Outlier > 3 std means merger’ refers to a scenario, where we treat an observation of 3 standard deviations
above or below the year-specific mean as indicating a merger and mark the firm henceforth as a new one. ‘Shorter
in sample (2 obs.)’ refers to a scenario, where we require firms to have two observations in first differences (instead
of five) to be in the sample. The next row requires 20 observations. ‘Selection correction’ refers to a scenario where
we estimate a simple selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selection and the firm-
level investment rate is modeled as a mean regression. We use the maximum likelihood estimator by Heckman
(1976) to infer the selection-corrected variance of the residual in the firm-level investment rate equation.




                                                                              29
    Perhaps most importantly, Table 15 shows in the last and next to last row that the cyclical
effects we find are not due to cyclical variations in the sample composition. In the scenario ‘Se-
lection correction’ we control for sample selection in the following way: we estimate a simple
selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selection and the firm-level
investment rate is modeled as a mean regression. We use the maximum likelihood estimator by
Heckman (1976) to infer the selection-corrected variance of the residual in the firm-level in-
vestment rate equation. The latter is very close to the sample variance of firm-level investment
rates, indicating that our results are not influenced by systematic sample drop-outs. Interest-
ingly, the correlation we receive from this procedure is almost identical to the one we obtain
when we restrict the analysis to firms that are almost always in the sample.
    Table 16 shows that the ownership structure matters for cross-sectional results (focussing on
publicly traded firms in Germany would eliminate the procyclicality of investment dispersion),
making it important to use broader data sets for the study of cross-sectional facts (see Davis et
al. (2006), for a similar point).

Notes: see notes to Table 1. The table displays correlation coefficients of the investment rate dispersion by legal
form with the cyclical component of the aggregate real gross value added of the nonfinancial private business
sector, detrended by an HP(100)-filter. ‘Publicly Traded’ means the German legal forms of AG and KGaA. ‘Lim-
ited Liability Companies’ means the German legal forms of GmbH and GmbH& Co KG. ‘Fully Liable Partnerships’
means the German legal forms of GBR, OHG and KG.




Other Data Sources - Cross Country Evidence
    To asses whether procyclical investment dispersion is specific to Germany, we compare our
findings with results obtained from the UK DTI-database and from Compustat data in the U.S.
The UK data covers the period 1977-1990 and stems from a sample of firms in the manufactur-
ing and some selected non-financial service sectors in Britain. It oversamples large firms, but
is otherwise meant to be representative. For the U.S. we use Compustat annual accounts from
1968-2006.
    We apply the same data treatment criteria as for USTAN. Then the UK data comprises 10,966
firm-year observations after removal of outliers and constraining the sample to firms with at
least 5 observations in first differences. The same procedure yields for the U.S. a final sample of
67,394 firm-year observations.



                                                        30
    Table 17 shows that investment dispersion is robustly procyclical in UK and U.S. data sets,
very much in line with our findings for the German USTAN data. For the Compustat sample,
we find a slightly mitigated (though positive) cyclicality of the investment rate dispersion. This
reflects that, in contrast to both the DTI data base and USTAN, Compustat covers only publicly
traded and mostly large companies. The firms in the Compustat sample are typically larger than
even the top 5% largest firms in the USTAN data. That they nevertheless display a procyclical
investment rate dispersion and the fact that in Germany publicly traded and very large firms
have an investment dispersion that is basically acyclical (see Tables 3 and 16), suggests that in
the U.S. investment dispersion may overall be even more procyclical than in Germany.

Notes: aggregate output data, Y , for the U.S. refers to real gross value added in the nonfinancial private business
sector. For the UK we use aggregate real gross value added instead, as the corresponding sectoral data is not
publicly available for the relevant time period. Dispersion measures are linearly detrended.


    The following Figures 3 and 4 depict the time series of the cross-sectional investment rate
dispersion and cyclical aggregate output, respectively, for the data and from a simulation of the
baseline model.
