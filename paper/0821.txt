                    NEW MEASURES OF LABOR COST:
   IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMAND ELASTICITIES AND NOMINAL WAGE GROWTH

                            ABSTRACT


     This study develops alternative quarterly measures of labor costs

that refine the published data on hourly earnings and hourly compensation

for the period 1953—1978. These new series account for deviations of

hours paid for from hours worked, for the tax treatment of wages under

the corporate income tax, and for variations in the user cost of train-

ing. They generally produce somewhat higher elasticities of labor demand,

and explain variations in employment over time slightly better than do

the published series. They also provide a different view of the recent

path of wage inflation in the United States, suggesting that nominal

wage growth has been more responsive to variations in the rate of price

inflation than the published labor—cost series indicate. A data appendix

lists the values of these new series; one series (that which adjusts for

the hours paid/hours worked distinction) can be updated with readily avail-

able data by persons interested in using these more appropriate measures

of the cost of labor facing employers.

I. Introduction

     There is no single measure of labor costs that is appropriate for

all purposes. Surely the measure appropriate to the employee relates

his take—home pay plus the probabilistically weighted future stream of

benefits deriving from his taxes to the disutility of the hours he works.

This is clearly different from the measure that a profit—maximizing em-

ployer will use in her hiring decisions. While I do not claim that the

measures developed here are ideal descriptions of the aggregate variable

characterizing the typical employer's decisions, they seem far better

than those used in the voluminous literature that employs measures of

labor costs either as indicators of the price of labor or (still less

appropriately) as indicators or workers' well—being.

     In Section II I develop alternative quarterly time series of labor

costs and show how their time paths over the past quarter century differ

from that of average hourly earnings. Section III examines the general

issue of whether replacing average hourly earnings by these labor cost

measures in standard labor demand models affects the estimates of the

demand elasticities that are produced. These models are estimated using

payroll employment data for four major industries and for the entire pri-

vate nonfarm sector. Finally, Section IV examines the extent to which

the insensitivity of the growth rate of nominal wages in the U.S., to

which others have pointed, is real or merely an artifact based on too

narrow a measure of labor costs. Though these two sections and the dis-

cussion in the concluding Section V show the value and importance of

using better measures of labor costs, such demonstrations are only part

of my purpose here. As important is the construction of the new measures

of labor costs themselves. To facilitate their use by others I present

the values of these series in the Appendix.

II. Measures of Labor Costs

       Series on average hourly earnings (see Employment and Earnings,

any issue) are based on all regular payroll, including paid vacations,

holidays, etc., but excluding irregular payments, such as Christmas and

other bonuses, and required or nonmandatory fringe benefit charges. The

measure is clearly quite far from the employer's average cost of an hour

of labor input into production. Even the Bureau of Labor Statistics'

measure of average hourly compensation only includes employers' payments

for fringes such as Social Security, workers' compensation, health, retire-

ment, etc. Despite commonly—held views to the contrary (see, eg., Sachs,

1979), the distinction between hours worked and hours paid for does not

enter into this measure, and bonuses are excluded:

                 Hours of wage and salary workers in nonagricultural
               establishments refer to hours paid for all employees
               ——production workers, nonsupervisory workers, and
               salaried workers.
                 Compensation per hour includes wages and salaries of
               employees plus employers' contributions for social
               insurance and private benefit plans. (Employment and
               Earnings, February 1981, p. 181).

       The user cost of training, which surely must be considered part of

the average cost of labor, also does not appear in either of these measures,

nor does the net (after—tax) cost of labor) In this section I develop

a series of increasingly complex measures of labor costs that take account

of these omissions from the commonly used series on wages and compensation.

These include measures of the cost of an hour of work (COSTWK); that mea-

sure adjusted for the tax treatment of labor costs (COSTTAX); cost per

hour worked plus the user cost of training (ECNT); and this last measure

adjusted for the tax treatment of labor costs (EC). All the calculations

are presented separately for manufacturing and the private business sec-

tor (because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce data, on which many of the
                                 3



calculations are based, have a sufficiently large sample of firms only

in manufacturing among the individual industries analyzed).2

       I start with the first three series whose trends are presented

in Table 1——straight—time average hourly earnings (AHES); average hourly

earnings (AHE), and compensation per hour (HCONP).3 For both manufactur-

ing and the private business sector I present the trend rate of growth

of each series between 1953:1 and 1978:IV, and the actual growth rate

between 1968:IV and1978:IV.4 The values of AHES for manufacturing, ATTE,

HCO, and those of all the series derived here, are presented in Appendix

Tables A.1 and A.2. The growth rate of each series in Table 1 is in

real terms: The deflator for manufacturing is the producers' price index

of manufactured goods, that for private business is the deflator for

output from the private business sector.5 Not surprisingly, given the

sharp increases in mandatory social insurance payments, and in bargained

and unilaterally granted retirement and health benefits, real hourly com-

pensation has increased far more rapidly, both in the entire postwar pe-

riod and in the last decade, than have average hourly earnings. Clearly,

even the slightly more comprehensive measure, hourly compensation, may

produce substantially different views of phenomena relating to labor cost.

       As the first step in modifying the existing cost series, I account

for the existence of irregular payments, such as bonuses and the distinc-

tion between time paid and time worked. This latter distinction accounts

for clean—up time, vacations, holidays, etc., though not for on—the—job

leisure. I define the cost per hour worked as:


       COSTWK = (HC0MP + OTH*AHE)/(1_s1),
                                  4



where HCOMP is the BLS compensation per hour paid; 0TH is the fraction

of payroll in theChamber of Commerce surveys for irregular payments to

labor; and s1 is the fraction of payroll in the surveys that goes for

time not worked.6 As Table 1 shows, this series has increased somewhat

more rapidly than even hourly compensation (almost entirely because of

increases in the length of paid vacations and the number of paid holidays).

The differences between the trends in the two series seem fairly constant

over the twenty—six year period 1953—78. It is worth noting, though, that,

while the postwar trends in manufacturing and the entire private business

sector are nearly identical, real labor costs in the rest of the private

business sector have increased far more rapidly recently than those in

manufacturing.

       Like interest payments and material costs, labor costs are an expense

that corporations can deduct when calculating their profits for tax purposes.

As such, a lower corporate income tax rate raises the net cost of labor to

the firm. (It will change the price of labor relative to that of capital,

since capital costs cannot be expensed, so long as investment tax credits

and allowable depreciation rates are not changed.) Since 1953 the highest

marginal corporate tax rate has been steadily lowered: It was 52 percent

from 1953—63; 50 percent in 1964, and 48 percent from 1965—78. This

reduction has raised the net cost of labor by lowering the fraction of labor

costs than can be subsidized through reduced taxes.   I calculate COSTTAX as

one minus the marginal corporate income tax rate times COSTWK.7 The long—

term and recent trends in COSTTAX are presented in the fifth row of Table 1;

they reflect the extra fillip to net labor costs that has been induced by

the steady reduction in corporate income tax rates over the years.
                                 5


       When an employer hires a worker, the costs of hiring and training

are presumably justified by the higher productivity expected. Insofar as

the training is entirely general, the workerts earnings will reflect the

costs of training. However, to the extent that the training is specific,

the firm will bear part of the costs of training, and any measure that

does not account for this will be incomplete.8 Such costs must be in-

cluded in an expanded labor cost measure. Materials costs obviously

belong; and since the time of instructors is included in the denominator

of COSTWK though it does not add to production directly, it must be sub

tracted out implicitly by adding it to the cost per hour of those workers

actually engaged in production. Essentially, instructors' time is a

fixed cost to be allocated over that part of total hours worked accounted

for by persons engaged in production.

       The degree of bias resulting from ignoring this problem may have

changed over time, both because the amount of training relative to the

value of the raw labor may have changed, and because the time horizon

over which the training costs can be amortized (the expected length of

the worker's stay with the firm) may have changed. While we cannot mea—

sure changes in the relative costs of training and raw labor, we can

account for changes that may have occurred in the time horizon. So too,

we can adjust a training cost series to account for cyclical variations

that do not affect long—term calculations of training costs.

       The time horizon over which the employer's share of the cost of

specific training can be amortized depends on the number of hours worked

per time period and the expected length of the worker's stay with the firm.

This latter in turn is a function of the expected quit rate. To derive

measures of the firm's expectations about hours worked, H*, and the quit

rate, Q*,   I   estimate:
                                            6



                     (la) Q = a0 + a1t + a2U

    and


                     (ib) H =
                                  b0 + b1t + b2U + b3PTTIME

where Q is the aggregate quit rate (measured as the fraction quitting); H

is the length of the average workweek (in manufacturing or in the entire

private business sector); t is a time trend; U is the unemployment rate

of males 25—54 (a cyclical indicator); PTTIME is the fraction of workers

(in manufacturing or the private business sector) who work part—time; and

the a. and b. are regression coefficients to be estimated.9 Equation (la)

is estimated using quarterly data, 1953:1 —               1978:IV, for manufacturing only
because of the lack of good data for most of nonmanufacturing; because the

data on part—time employment are not available before 1957, equation (lb)

is estimated on quarterly data for manufacturing and private business,

1957:1 —     l978:IV.1°    The estimates are used to derive series on Q* and H*

that are free of cyclical variations and changes induced by the changing

part—time——full—time composition of the labor force. In particular, Q* =

Q
    —              and H* = H —              —        (PTTIME — PTTINE), where the superior
        a2(U—U),                  b2(U—U)        b3
bar denotes the sample mean and the carat denotes an estimate. Q* and H*

are thus the adjusted quit rate and average weekly hours respectively.

           The second input into the calculation of the user cost of training

is a measure of the amount of specific training embodied in the average

worker. We cannot derive a time series on the user cost, but we can mea-

sure it at a point in time for use with the time—varying Q* and H*. I

rely on the assumption that the cost of specific training is split evenly

between the worker and the employer while general training cost is borne

by, and all benefits reaped by the worker. (The former is a reasonable
                                       7



outcome under certain symmetry assumptions about the underlying bilateral

monopoly.) I estimate S/(S+G), the ratio of specific to total (specific

plus general) training, as the ratio of the effect of job tenure relative

to that of total experience on the wage in a sample of typical workers.

Using the estimates of Nincer—Jovanovic (1981) for a representative sample

of male workers in 1975 from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics,

this ratio is .324 at the mean wage.11 Under the assumption that the

cost of specific training is split evenly between the employer and the

worker, the employer's share of total training costs for the typical work-

er is .5 S/S+G), or .162. Assume that the amount of training can be de-

rived as the difference in earnings between the average person with no

experience and the average person.         (To the extent that wages of inex-

perienced workers are depressed because they are paying for specific train-

ing, this will overstate its true cost.) Then we can use Mincer's (1974)

estimates for white, nonfarm males in 1959 to derive the amount of annual

earnings due to training as .162 [W—W0}, where W is the average annual

earnings in a sample of workers, and          is the earnings of the average

worker with zero experience.

       Assuming further that the rate of return to specific training equals

the rate of return to education, the present value of the employer's return

to the specific—training investment relative to average annual earnings is:

       T =                     .   1
             {.162[W_W0]/re}

where re is the rate of return to education. I estimate T = 1.076.         In

any given year, then, the value of the employer's cost of specific train-

ing of full—time worker equivalents is (2000t) AHEt. To find the cost of

amortizing this investment, convert adjusted weekly hours,           to monthly

hours (4.33 Hg), and divide it into the adjusted monthly quit rate, Q
                                        8


to derive the fraction of the investment expected to disappear each hour.

Then the emp1oyers cost of specific training per hour paid is:


            —    Q       [2000T] AHEt
       Tt       4.33H*

Tt is multiplied by (l+s1) to convert it to a per hour worked basis; the

result is added to COSTWKt to derive ECNTt. These series reflect differ-

ences between hours paid and hours worked, all nonwage payments, and the

user cost of training. The long—term and recent trends in these series

for manufacturing and for private business are presented in the penultimate

row of Table 1. The differences in the trends between these series and

COSTWK are slight. It is interesting to note that ECNT has been rising

more rapidly than COSTWK in manufacturing since 1968, though it rose less

rapidly until 1968.

       The fifth and final measure of labor costs simply takes the measures

ECNT and multiplies them by one minus the marginal corporate income tax

rate to derive after—tax employment cost measures, EC, that include the

user cost of specific training. The last row of Table 1 shows the trends

in these series. Since they differ little from those in COSTTAX, they do

not merit special comment.

       Are these new measures consistent with ones that might be constructed

from other sources of data? Consider the ratios in the two rows of Table 2.

Those in the first row are based on averages for the second and third quar-

ters of each year from Appendix Table A.2. (The data for 1979:11 are based

on updates of the series made possible when the 1979 Chamber of Commerce

data became available.) The ratio shows the rapid rise in fringe benefits

and the ratio of hours paid to hours worked. Most remarkably, it is strik-

ingly close to the ratio of total compensation to pay for time worked based

on the Employer Expenditures on Employee Compensation (EEEC) survey
                                 9



(calculated from Smeeding, 1981). Not only are the increases very similar,

but the levels are within 1 1/2 percent of each other. This suggests that

the adjustments that led from ABE to COSTWK are reasonable, and that our new

series are fairly free of errors that might result from the unrepresenta—

tiveness of the Chamber of Commerce sample. Also, unlike series based on

the EEEC data, ours can be constructed beginning In the early 1950's rather

than in 1966.


III. Estimates of Labor Demand Elasticities Based on Alternative Measures
      of Labor Costs

       Numerous studies have attempted to estimate tIthe elasticity of de-

mand for labor.   (See Hamermesh, 1976, for a review of this literature,

and Solow, 1980, for a discussion of its importance in analyzing the be-

havior of the macro economy.) We know fairly conclusively that short—run

(perhaps one—year) elasticities for all labor are quite low, perhaps no

greater than .3; that the lags of employment behind changes in the demand

for output are short——an average length less than six months; and that the

lags in response to changes in factor prices are somewhat longer——average

lags between six months and one year.

       All of the studies that comprise this literature are based on mea-

sures of factor payments to labor that either consist simply of average

hourly earnings, or that include the slightly broader definition, compen-

sation per hour paid. Assuming, as seems reasonable, that productivity per

hour worked has not increased proportionally, other things equal, as hours

worked have declined relative to hours paid since 1954, on a priori grounds

the broader measures can be expected to produce higher estimated elastici-

ties. But, in fact, do the estimates depend very greatly upon these def in—

itions? That is, will a broader, and presumably more appropriate definition

produce sharply different estimates of these elasticities? Do the more
                                  10


theoretically appropriate measures explain variations in employment demand

better than the simpler measures that have been used in the literature?

This section examines these questions.

        I use a fairly standard model of employment demand in which

changes in output demand reflect a scale effect; changes in factor prices

reflect substitution along an isoquant; and a time trend reflects changes

in factor productivity. The basic equation is:

                             N1             N2
              (2) Et =cz
                       0
                         + E .Q . + E .W
                             1 t—i+l   i. t—i+l
                                            .
                                                         +t+E     t
                                            i=l


where E is employment demand; Q is output; W is a labor cost measure, t is

time, and c is a disturbance term. No current wage or output terms are

included in order to avoid any potential simultaneity; further lagged

measures of wages and output are included to reflect the finding in the

literature that there is a lagged response of employment to these. They

are specified in relatively free form because of the consensus that the

lags in the responses to changes in output and factor prices are not identical.

The lengths of the lagged responses to changes in Q and W, N1 and N2, will

be determined by varying these and finding the lengths that fit the data

best. Though some studies have included a measure of the user cost of

capital, we do not include it in this section. (This follows the finding

of Clark—Freeman, 1980, for the U.S. that its inclusion has little effect on

the coefficients of the other variables in (2), apparently because of the

large amount of measurement error in the user cost of capital included in

previous studies. See also Kollreuter, 1980, for West Germany.)

       The labor—cost series measure average, not marginal costs; fixed

costs, such as the training included in ECNT and EC, and part of the social

insurance, health insurance and pension costs included in all the series

other than ABE, are spread over all hours worked. A complete labor demand
                                      11



model would estimate the responses of demand for persons and hours separ-

ately, and allow for asymmetry in the responses of each to changes in the

labor costs. Thus the short—run elasticities of demand for employees, the

y 1,   are not correctly estimated; but the long—run elasticities, the Ey
                                                                        1
on which I concentrate here, are.

         The data are quarterly time series, l953:I—l978:IV; because of the

need to allow sufficient observations to measure lagged adjustments, the

first data points on E used in estimating (2) are from 1955:1. The data

cover the private nonfarm sector; in addition, separate equations are estimated

for the goods—producing sectors, manufacturing, transportation and public

utilities, and mining and construction. (These latter two are aggregated

because the time series on output was only available for this aggregate.)

The employment measure in each case is payroll employment from the monthly

BLS—790 data, averaged to produce a quarterly series.
                                                          l   Output is gross

domestic product originating in the sector, and, except for manufacturing,

this and the labor cost series are deflated by the implicit deflator for

gross domestic product in the sector. (In manufacturing I use the producers'

price index for manufactured goods.) For each sector the estimates of (2)

are produced separately for each of four labor cost series discussed in

Section II: ARE., COSTWK., COSTTAX., and ECNT..13 The latter three

measures are in each case based upon the average hourly earnings in the
                                 14
particular sector under study.

         Equations (2) are estimated using polynomial distributed lags to

produce the coefficient estimates          and y.. Quadratics were used in all

cases, and N1 and N2 were set equal to 4 and 8 alternatively.15 Since in

all cases I find that the shorter lag structure performed better than the

longer, the results are presented for N1 =           4. The equations are
                                                N2
estimated adjusting for possible autocorrelation in the error structure of

(2) using the Cochrane—Orcutt iterative technique.
                                12


       The results of estimating (2) for the total private nonfarm sector,

and for the three smaller aggregates separately, are presented in Tables 3

through 6. Let us consider first the peripheral issues before concentrating

on the two questions raised earlier in this section that provide the rationale

for examining these results.    I find in all cases that there is, as is

usual in time series studies of employment demand, substantial autocorrelation

in the residuals even when a time trend is included. This suggests that

those studies (the majority) that have failed to adjust for this problem

have likely produced inefficient estimates of wage and output elasticities

of employment demand.   I also find, somewhat disturbingly, that there is

no significant negative time trend in employment demand, ceteris paribus,

in transportation and public utilities, and in the entire private nonfarm

sector. Since I would expect labor—saving technical progress to have

occurred in these sectors, and to see it reflected in a negative trend term,

this result is disturbing. Perhaps, though, previous authors' findings

on this have been clouded by their failure to account carefully for serial

correlation in the residuals.

       Consider which of the labor cost measures produces the lowest standard

error of estimate in the aggregate of the private nonfarm sector and in the

three separate subaggregates. We see from Table 3 that in the aggregate

COSTWK gives the best fit, as it does too in manufacturing. COSTTAX produces

the best fit in mining and construction, while ECNT gives the best results

in transportation and public utilities. The differences in the fits across

the equations using the different series are not great; nonetheless, it is

apparent that, at the least, there are gains to basing the compensation mea-

sure on hours actually worked rather than hours paid for to describe employ-

ers' labor demand.16 While various of the labor cost measures perform best

in the various sectors, in each case the measure that does best is based on
                                13


hours worked. This suggests that the literature on labor demand, based

as it is on measures of earnings or compensation per hour paid for, has

problems.

       If we view the incomplete measure of labor costs, AHE, as embodying

an error of measurement, we should expect previous work to have underesti-

mated the true elasticity. In fact, in the samples used here I find that,

with the exception of transportation and public utilities (in which the wage

terms are not significantly different from zero), using better measures of

labor costs increases the absolute values of the wage elasticities. For

example, in the private nonfarm sector the elasticity increases from .40

in the equation using ARE to .47 in the equation that gives the best fit,

that using COSTWK. Similarly, in manufacturing the estimated elasticity in-

creases from .23 to .29; in mining and construction the estimate goes from

.22 to .36 in the best—fit equation, that based on COSTTAX. Though the differ—

encesareless than one standard error in all cases, it appears reasonable

to conclude that labor—demand elasticities produced in previous time—series

studies are underestimates because of the failure to include a sufficiently

comprehensive measure of labor costs.

       Basing the equations on better measures of labor costs also affects

the estimated trend terms and the employment—output elasticities. In the

latter case, the effects are very minor. For example, in the private

nonf arm sector and in mining and construction there is a tiny increase, while

in manufacturing and transport and public utilities there is a decrease, The

time trend becomes more positive, except in transport and public utilities,

when the better labor cost measures are included; in manufacturing, though,

the only industry in which this trend was significant, it remains negative.

       Perhaps the best conclusion from this evidence is that there is some

payoff to greater attention to the variables used to reflect labor costs in

studies of employment demand. A more careful specification improves slightly
                                14


the ability to track variations in employment, and it increases the esti-

mated responses of employment demand to exogenous changes in labor costs.

One would suppose in complete systems of factor demand equations, where

incorrect data series might interact with powerful estimators to produce

greater errors, that an even larger payoff would exist.17

IV. Do Nominal Labor Costs in the U.S. Respond to Short—term Price
     Variations?

       Several authors (Sachs, 1979; and Grubb, et al, 1981) have pointed

to the apparent nonresponsiveness of nominal changes in labor costs in the

U.S. as the rate of price inflation varies. Both use narrowly defined

labor costs (the former, private nonf arm compensation per hour paid, the

latter, manufacturing average hourly earnings). It is claimed that this

apparent rigidity in the growth rate of nominal wages has enabled the U.S.

to maintain real wage flexibility when exogenous price shocks occur and

thus avoid the sharp increases in unemployment that plagued other Western

nations in the mid— and late l970s. Is this observation correct, though,

or is it merely an artifact produced by defining labor costs too narrowly?

       We can write the true costs per hour worked, C, as:


              (3) Ct =   w[l + Mt}
where W is a more narrowly defined measure of labor costs (wages or

compensation per hour paid for), and Mt is the percentage by which true

costs per hour of labor input differ at time t from the narrower measure.

Taking logarithms and differentiating with respect to time:


              (4) c=w+i

where lower—case letters denote logs, and the dot () denotes the time

derivative. For the pattern of true labor costs to vary more closely with

short—term price fluctuations than do earnings, the mark—up over earnings
                                   15


must itself change over time with the rate of price inflation. Is this

likely to occur? Remembering that C and W differ by hours of paid leisure

and (mostly untaxed) health, pension and other contributions, a tentative

affirmative answer seems reasonable. Given the nature of the U.S. tax

structure in the l970s, more rapid price inflation raised the marginal

tax rate facing the average worker, thus lowering the price of nonwage

elements of compensation. It has been shown that workers do react to the

tax price of different components of compensation (Woodbury, 1981); that

being the case, we should not be surprised to see that c varies more closely

with price changes than does the narrower £r.

       Annual percentage changes in five labor—cost series are presented

in Table 7 along with their coefficients of variation and changes in the

CPI for the period beginning with the oil shock. Especially in manufactur-

ing, ARE and HCOMP are far less variable than are the broader measures I

have derived, as simple inspection of their values for 1975—78 and consider-

ation of the standard deviation of these four values shows. More important,

the broader measures seem to vary with changes in the CPI during this period

substantially more closely than do hourly earnings or compensation per hour

paid in manufacturing. In the entire private business sector even ARE and

HCOMP do show some signs of varying with the CPI during the mid—1970s; how-

ever, their variability is less, and apparently less closely related to

that of the CPI, than is the variation in the broader labor—cost measures

I have derived.

       Additional light on the relation between ih and inflation is shown

by estimates of:


(5) COSTWKt - AREt = a + b CPI, t        l973,...,l979.

For manufacturing b from (5) is .28 (t =    1.40);   for the private business

sector it is .04 (t =   .47).   This provides some confirmation, though, perhaps
                                16


because of the size of the post—shock sample, hardly overwhelming evidence,

of a positive relation between inflation and the divergence between growth

in labor costs per hour and average hourly earnings.

       My purpose here has not been to demonstrate that the coefficient on

labor—market slack in an equation relating changes in labor cost to expect-

ed price changes and the extent of slack increases when one defines labor

costs more broadly (though i think that is the case). Rather, it has been

the narrower one of pointing out the pitfalls of basing one's view of macro-

economic adjustment on inappropriate measures of labor costs. The rate of

change of nominal labor costs may perhaps have been less responsive to price

inflation in the U.S. than in other countries in the l970s; but its lack

of variability was less than is indicated by commonly used measures of the

demand price of labor.


V. Conclusions and Other Uses

       There is no perfect measure of labor costs; but in this study I

have presented calculations leading to the construction of easily usable

alternative measures beyond the published ones on average hourly earnings

and hourly compensation. These new series account for deviations of hours

paid for from hours worked, for the tax treatment of wages under the corpor-

ate income tax, and for variations in the user cost of training. When used

in place of the published series in regression equations describing the

demand for labor in the United States, they generally produce slightly

better fits and somewhat higher wage elasticities. This is to be expected

insofar as they purge the published series of additive errors of measurement.

The new series also provide a somewhat different view of the recent path

of wage inflation in the United States, suggesting that nominal wage growth

has been more responsive to variations in price inflation than the published

labor—cost series indicate.
                                17


       I have not given the potential user of these series any guide about

which one is in any sense the "best't to use for various purposes; in fact,

no such guide is possible. However, the results on labor demand, and a

consIderation of the concept of the employer's cost of labor, suggest at

the very least that a series that adjusts for the hours paid/hours worked

distinction is required. Thus the series COSIWK, that adjusts hourly

compensation and average hourly earnings to account for this distinction,

would seem a good choice for use in any research requiring a measure of

the demand—price of labor. It has the additional virtue of being easy

to update from readily available information using very simple techniques,

as I have done in the Appendix for 1979; and it is much "cleaner" than the

more complex series I have constructed.

       There is substantial scope and need for using these new series or

refined versions of them in other empirical work in labor economics. I

have shown that they add to our ability to understand empirical aspects

of labor demand; though their effects in the simple equations I have

presented are not major, they may well be far greater in the very closely

specified equations (see Sargent, 1978) that have used only the average

earnings per hour paid for. Similarly, studies of the behavior of layoffs

in the aggregate (eg., Brechling, 1981), which are important for analyzing

the impact of unemployment Insurance, for testing the theory of implicit

contracts, and for examining unions' effects on the employment relation,

should be based on these newer series rather than the earnings or compensation

measures now used. Some of the complicated testing of recent theoretical

results in macroeconomics, for example tests of disequilibrium in aggregated

markets (Rosen—Quandt, 1978) or of the intertemporal substitution hypothesis

 (Altonji—Ashenfelter, 1980) would be better examined using the new series

derived here. Finally, though the conventional wisdom in the hoary debate

of the cyclical behavior of real wages is that they are procyclical (Tobin,
                                18


1980), a view supported by the most recent empirical work (Chirinko, 1980),

the issue has not been examined using proper measures of the price per hour

worked. In all these cases, then, there is a need for basing empirical work

on a measure of labor costs more closely related to the concept being examined

than are the average earnings or compensation measures that have been

used. Though the trends in our series do not differ that greatly from

those In the standard series, even slight differences are likely to have

major impacts on estimates from tightly—fitting time—series equations.

      The measures are not true reflections of the price of an efficiency

unit of labor, as they have not made two corrections. First, they do not

account for changes in the composition of hours within aggregates because

of changes in the industrial mix of employment. (This is, though, done

by the new Employment Cost Index series produced by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.) Second, they do not adjust for cyclical and secular changes

in labor quality (nor does any other series). Thus, though representing

an improvement over what is available, they must be viewed as a step on

the road between the series now available and the ideal series.

                             FOOTNOTES

       *
        This paper is based partly on research done in fulfillment of the

terms of Contract No. J—9—M—O—0078 from the Minimum Wage Study Commission

to the National Bureau of Economic Research. All findings and conclusions

are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect the official

views of the Commission or the National Bureau. Helpful comments and essen-

tial data were provided by Curtis Gilroy, Ed Lazear, and Walter Oi and

Jack Triplett. Charles Brown provided encouragement and guidance throughout

the project. Excellent research assistance was given by Paul Koch and

Paul Wendt.

       1Chinloy (1980) includes some fringe benefits, such as employer con-

tributions for social insurance, in his calculation of labor costs, but

ignores the distinction between hours paid and hours worked.


       2The source for these series is U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Employee

Benefits, a biennial survey through 1977 that has been conducted annually

since then. Though sample sizes were smaller in the early years of the sur-

vey, in 1978 the data are based on 497 manufacturing firms, and 361 nonmanu—

facturing companies. These surveys clearly overrepresent large firms (though

decreasingly so), for firms with fewer than 100 employees are excluded.

Since larger firms do offer higher fringes relative to wages, the levels of

the measures I produce are biased up from what a representative sample would

produce. There is, though, no reason to expect their growth rates to be

biased up for this reason, andthe discussion below suggests this is the case.

       3Straight—tiine AHE and AHE are monthly published BLS data gleaned

from the CITIBASE data file. These data were averaged to provide quarterly

series for use in this study. Unpublished data on compensation per hour of

employees were provided to me by Randy Norsworthy of the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.
                               22




       4These trends are derived from a bivariate regression of the log-

arithm of the labor cost series on a time trend.


       5The deflator and the producers' price index for manufacturing are

taken from the CITIBASE data file. The latter series was averaged to put

it on a quarterly basis.


       6Because the Chamber of Commerce data are available only biennially,

I interpolated linearly between observations in this series, treating each

observation as having been made in the middle of the calendar year to which

the survey is attributed. (Thus I assume implicitly that the surveys were

taken on July 1 of the years in question.)

          recognize that not all employers in the private business sector

are incorporated; that not all corporations pay the highest marginal tax

rate; and that the average tax rate may be more appropriate than the mar-

ginal for some purposes. Nonetheless, many of the largest employers do pay

the highest rate; marginal rates paid by others are correlated with the

top marginal rates and average rates are likely to be correlated over time

with marginal rates. I therefore base the COSTTAX series on the highest

marginal corporate income tax rate payable in the calendar year. In doing

so I also ignore any issue of tax incidence.

       8Thj distinction and the conclusions about the burdens of the costs

of training of different types stem from Becker (1964).

       9Data on the number of voluntary part—time workers are from BLS,

Handbook of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 2000, and Employment and Earnig,

January 1979.

      '°For manufacturing the parameter estimates are: a0 = .0294; a1 =

.000047; a2 = —.0037; b0      43.59; b1 =   .028; b2 = —.40; b3 = —1.46.   The

coefficients of determination for the two equations are .753 and .615;

the equations were estimated by ordinary least squares. For the private

business sector the estimates are: b0 = 44.58; b1 = '-.0067;           —.21;
                                                             b2

b3 = —.31.    The R2 for this equation was .956.

      11.
       W is     calculated from Mincer s regression (1974, p. 92) as $5636

and W* as $1633. The implied rate of return to education is .107. In

regressions from the NLS adult women's sample in Mincer—Jovanovic (1981)

SIS+G is .349, while in similar regressions for older inles in the NLS

sample in 1973 the same calculation yields .638.      I use the Michigan esti-

mates because they are the only ones that are representative of the entire

population of adult male workers.


      12Equations like (2) were estimated for manhours also. The results

in manufacturing were similar to those found for employment: The series

based on AHE never fit as well as other series, and the wage elasticities

produced with the more complex series were higher. For the private business

sector the results were remarkably insensitive to the specification of the

labor cost variables.

      13Since the equations using HCOMP or EC never produced a lower

than those listed in the tables, and since I include equations based on

AHE for comparison purposes, I do not present the equations using these

two measures.


      14The inclusion of AHE., C0STWK and ECNT. is straightforward (though

the calculation of ECNT1 for the non—manufacturing sectors requires that Tt

be deflated by the ratio of the sector's AHEt to manufacturing AHE). In-

cluding COSTTAX1 in a labor—demand equation is justified, as it reflects the
                               24


net price of labor relevant to the movements along an isoquant implied

when output in physical units (Q) is held constant.

      15Choosing the appropriate N reduces to finding the best fit, since

the degrees of freedom in the regression are the same (dependent on the

degree of the polynomial used) for any N.

      16The importance of the distinction between hours paid and hours

worked has been stressed in the context of measuring cyclical changes in

labor productivity by Fair (1969).

             payoff is evident in the estimation of a system of equations

for adult and teen labor in Hamermesh (1981).
