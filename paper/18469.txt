                                            ABSTRACT

Humans run on a fuel called food. Yet economists and other social scientists rarely study what people
eat. We provide simple evidence consistent with the existence of a link between the consumption
of fruit and vegetables and high well-being. In cross-sectional data, happiness and mental health rise
in an approximately dose-response way with the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables.
The pattern is remarkably robust to adjustment for a large number of other demographic, social and
economic variables. Well-being peaks at approximately 7 portions per day. We document this relationship
in three data sets, covering approximately 80,000 randomly selected British individuals, and for seven
measures of well-being (life satisfaction, WEMWBS mental well-being, GHQ mental disorders, self-reported
health, happiness, nervousness, and feeling low). Reverse causality and problems of confounding
remain possible. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis, how government policy-makers
might wish to react to it, and what kinds of further research -- especially randomized trials -- would
be valuable.

      Is Psychological Well-being Linked to the Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables?


1. Introduction


Thousands of papers have been published on the important topic of what determines
people’s happiness and psychological health. Little is known, however, about the potential
influence of the different kinds of foods that people eat. The well-known review papers of
Diener et al. (1994, 1999), Clark et al. (2008) and Dolan et al. (2008), for example, do not
mention the role of human diet.


An electronic search on the history of the journal Social Indicators Research uncovers only
one research article (Farnworth 2009) in which the consumption of fruit and vegetables is
mentioned in the Abstract or Key Words. That article is not concerned with potential links
to subjective well-being or mental health. Similar searches on the journals Psychological
Medicine and the Journal of Health Economics produce only one article (Capacci and
Mazzocchi, 2011), and that article is not about the consequences of healthy eating but
rather how that might be advertised to the public. In the journal Social Science & Medicine
there is a larger number of published articles (approximately 30), but almost none deals
with connections between well-being and healthy food.          One partial exception is the
interesting work of Dave and Kelly (2012). However, its focus is on how movements in the
business cycle affect both people’s consumption of fruit and vegetables and their mental
health. Carter et al. (2011) examines the influence of ‘food security’, rather than the direct
consumption of healthy food, upon psychological distress. Recently, a small literature in
public health has begun to find results suggestive of some form of correlation between
depression and lack of fruit and vegetables (for example, Piqueras et al. 2011, Jacka et al.
2010, and Tsai et al. 2012).


One reason why this lacuna in the well-being literature is paradoxical is that so much
attention has been paid -- in sub-literatures across science and social science -- to possible
links between physical well-being and human diet. That is reflected in policy. For more
than 20 years, western governments have recommended a diet in which people are advised
to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. This policy stemmed originally from a

                                            2
proposal in 1988 by the California Department of Health Services. The objective was to
reduce the incidence of cancer among Americans who, at that time, were eating fewer than
3 portions a day (Ness and Powles 1997). A 5-a-day policy for physical health has become
part of World Health Organization guidelines and been adopted by many nations. To our
knowledge, no government has advocated fruit and vegetables as part of a mental-health
policy.


Could the nature of food have an important potential role in humans’ psychological, and not
just bodily, well-being?      The background is that there is current interest among
governments in the measurement of psychological well-being (an official project is being
run, for example, by the UK’s Office for National Statistics entitled Measuring Subjective
Well-being in the UK, with large-scale data collection currently being undertaken). There is
a still-burgeoning statistical literature on the determinants of human happiness and mental
well-being (Diener et al. 1999, Easterlin 2003, Graham 2005, Layard 2005, Propper et al.
2005, Shields and Wheatley Price 2005, Blanchflower and Oswald 2008). Nevertheless, with
some important exceptions, such as Graham (2008) and Powdthavee (2009), there has been
less work on exactly how happiness interacts with health, although it is known that people’s
physical health conditions enter significantly in well-being equations. There has been
particularly little research in the modern well-being literature on the consequences of
people’s dietary choices (except indirectly as part of research into the effects of obesity).


The present study lies at the borders between a number of areas of social science. Its
specific focus is the role of fruit-and-vegetable consumption in well-being regression
equations. By using recent data, this study provides evidence of a positive association with
psychological well-being, and one that often reaches a peak at or above 5 portions a day or
more (in many of our equations, at approximately 7-8 portions of fruit and vegetables per
day). We explore the nature of this relationship in a number of data sets and for a range of
measures of human well-being -- life satisfaction, WEMWBS mental well-being, General
Health Questionnaire GHQ mental disorders, self-reported health, happiness, nervousness,
and feeling low. We show the relationship is robust to controls for a large set of possible
confounders.    That is important in this setting, because so many ‘healthy’ attributes,


                                             3
including high levels of education and income, are likely to be correlated with the eating of
fruit and vegetables.


The study employs a variety of measures -- they are defined individually in the appendix --
under the umbrella of subjective well-being. This is to make the point that a statistical link
with healthy eating appears a rather general one and does not depend on the use of one
particular well-being variable.


A limitation of our analysis should be made clear from the beginning. Our data sets are
cross-sectional. This implies that, as in some other parts of the well-being literature, we
cannot draw firm inferences about causality. It is perhaps natural, nevertheless, to begin
with cross-sectional associations. Here these are sufficiently marked, and robust to a
plethora of controls for confounding influences, that the associations seem to us potentially
of interest to a range of researchers in well-being, and to suggest that it will be valuable to
create future longitudinal data sets in which fruit-and-vegetable portions are measured.


2. Methods


Many social-science surveys do not record people’s consumption of fruit and vegetables.
That is probably one reason why, on this issue, the well-being literature remains small. To
try to make progress, we obtained a number of British data sets in which dietary variables
have become available.


The data sets used are the Welsh Health Survey of 2007-2010, the Scottish Health Survey of
2008, and the Health Survey of England in 2008. Each is a random sample of the adult
population so is representative of the respective nations. Together these samples, which
are cross-sectional, provide information on approximately 80,000 randomly selected
individuals.


We follow a now-long tradition -- surveyed in for example Dolan et al. 2008 -- in well-being
research of estimating regression equations on observational data. In such equations, the
dependent variable is a measure of subjective well-being or mental health. Much is known

                                            4
about the kinds of variables that enter statistically significantly in such equations (for
example, Blanchflower and Oswald 2004 and Clark et al. 2008). To allow for these possible
confounding effects, we incorporate independent variables and estimate equations of the
general form:


Psychological well-being = f(daily portions of fruit and vegetables consumed, age, gender,
education, income, etc)


and we are then interested in the size and level of statistical significance on the variable for
fruit and vegetable consumption.


The means and standard deviations of the study’s dependent variables are given in the
appendix of the paper. A long set of independent variables is included in the regression
equations. Because they are standard in the research literature, they are not defined in full
each time, and vary slightly from one data set to another, but they include banded dummy
variables for variables such as the age of the person and his or her level of education and
marital status. Body mass index is represented by the acronym BMI. Income is entered in
the regressions in a way that has been normalized (it is so-called equivalized income) for the
number of people living in the household. To check robustness, many other personal
characteristics are included in the equations.


3. Results from a range of well-being regression equations


The first results, given in Table 1, are for a sample of approximately 14,000 individuals from
the Scottish Health Surveys of 2008 and 2009. Table 1 reports regression equations -- one in
each of three columns -- in which the dependent variable is a person’s life satisfaction on an
eleven point integer scale from zero to ten. This estimation method treats the data as
cardinal; switching to an ordinal estimator makes no substantive difference. The mean of
life satisfaction is 7.6 and its standard deviation is 1.9. The question’s wording is given in
the Appendix.




                                             5
As independent variables in the fullest life-satisfaction equation of Table 1, we include 7
banded-dummy variables for people’s age; 1 gender dummy; 4 dummies for different racial
groups; 6 dummies for people’s different labour force status, such as unemployed or
retired; 5 marital-status dummies; dummy variables for the number of children, whether
the person has a long-standing illness, is sexually active, is a non-smoker, is religious;
variables for the person’s BMI and the log of their income. These variables are known from
the literature to enter significantly in well-being equations, so we do not comment in detail
on each one.


In its first column, Table 1 provides estimates of the raw unadjusted correlation between life
satisfaction and the daily number of portions of fruit and vegetables. A strong positive, and
almost monotonic, correlation is evident. Those people who eat 8+ portions a day have a
life-satisfaction score approximately 0.9 points higher than those who eat almost no
portions (all the fruit-and-vegetable coefficients, in this and later tables, are normalized
relative to the base case of eating fewer than 1-2 portions per day). Column 2 of Table 1
then corrects for a range of demographic characteristics: this regression equation
incorporates variables for a person’s age, gender, and race. There is evidence here of a
strong U-shape in age, in accordance with earlier literature (such as Blanchflower and
Oswald 2008), and of low levels of life satisfaction among black people. The fruit-and-
vegetable gradient, however, is almost unchanged from that in column 1.


In column 3 of Table 1, a larger set of variables are included. These are designed to correct
for possible confounding factors. Importantly, because it is to be expected that fruit and
vegetable consumption is correlated with many aspects of socioeconomic advantage, we
choose to control here (and throughout later tables) for, among others, factors such as:
Disability
Being unemployed
Marital status
Having children
Major illness
Being sexually active
The amount of exercise

                                            6
Smoking
Body mass index (BMI)
Being religious
Income
Social class
Education
Region.


These variables again enter the study’s equations with coefficients that are familiar from the
broader well-being literature. The role of region in Scotland’s consumption of fruit and
vegetables has been studied before, for example by Shelton (2009), although with a primary
emphasis on cardiovascular disease.


What emerges in the third column of Table 1 is that even after adjustments a marked fruit-
and-vegetable gradient is visible in people’s scores for life satisfaction. Those individuals
consuming 8+ portions a day have an adjusted life satisfaction score approximately 0.27
points higher (the exact coefficient is 0.2743 with a t-statistic, testing against the null of
zero, of 2.85) than those who eat almost no fruit and vegetables.


It might be thought that the coefficient of 0.2743 is small. However, its size is best seen in
perspective of the whole regression equation. From the coefficients of column 3 of Table 1,
we can observe that this corresponds to a larger life-satisfaction increment than being a
non-smoker (0.1945), is only a little less than that from being married (0.3611), and in
absolute size is more than half the coefficient of having a longstanding illness (-0.4368).
Being unemployed, which is known from well-being research to have routinely one of the
largest effects in happiness equations, is associated with approximately -0.9 points.


Might there be confounding with the consumption of other foods? Perhaps there is no
beneficial effect from eating fruit and vegetables, but rather it is simply that large numbers
of portions signal that someone eats less meat and drinks less alcohol, and that meat and
alchohol, say, are somehow harmful to well-being. Later we use a further data set to adjust
for other dietary factors. That check is not possible in these Scottish data.

                                             7
Table 2 moves to an equation that uses the new WEMWBS well-being measure. This is
closer to a positive well-being score and includes hedonic and eudaimonic perspectives. The
constituent parts (such as “I have been feeling optimistic” and “I have been feeling useful”)
are discussed in Tennant et al. (2007) and the appendix.


The mean of the dependent variable in Table 2 is 49.8 with a standard deviation of 8.5.
Once again, there is a positive association between eating fruit and vegetables and having
high mental well-being. In the fully adjusted estimates of column 3 of Table 2, those people
who eat 7-8 portions a day have a well-being score approximately 3 points greater than
those who eat tiny amounts of fruit and vegetables. In absolute size, this is notably large. It
exceeds the coefficient on being unemployed (-2.4302) and is almost half that from being
disabled (-6.4178). This intriguing result suggests that further research with WEMWBS
measures is desirable.


Table 3 moves to a psychiatric ill-being measure, a General Health Questionnaire GHQ score.
This has been widely used in the mental health literature as an indicator of psychological
morbidity (Goldberg et al 1997, Hu et al. 2007). It is scored here on a 36-point scale and has
a mean of 10.8 and a standard deviation of 5.0.


In each column of Table 3, there is again a fruit-and-vegetable gradient. In this case, mental
health runs fairly flat once a person reaches 5 or more fruit and vegetable portions per week
(at a coefficient in the third column, after full adjustment, of approximately 0.6). The
estimated effect is slightly smaller in size, when compared to coefficients on variables such
as unemployment (4.6055), than in equations with the earlier well-being measures.


The final set of regressions using Scottish data is in Table 4. Here, for completeness, the
dependent variable is self-reported health (How is your health in general? Would you say it
was Very Good, Good, Fair, Bad, or Very Bad). Its mean is 4.0 and its standard deviation is
0.96. In column 2 of Table 4, where there is a limited set of controls for confounding
influences, those who eat large amounts of fruit and vegetables have a better self-reported
health score than other people by a substantial amount, namely, by approximately one half

                                            8
a point out of a possible five.       Column 3 of Table 4 adjusts for the other possible
confounders. Now self-reported health reaches its maximum at 7-8 portions of fruit and
vegetables a day. Its coefficient is rather lower at 0.1650, with a t-statistic of 3.84, but again
an approximately monotonic relationship exists.


4. Controlling for meat, fish and alcohol consumption


People who are healthy in one kind of behaviour are likely to be healthy in others. A
potential criticism of the equations so far is that the data set makes it impossible to control
for other dietary factors such as fish- and meat-eating.


To check whether this is a difficulty, Table 5 switches to a different source of data, the 2008
Health Survey of England, in which more information about food intake is available. This
HSE provides a sample of approximately 14,000 individuals who report, among other things,
both their daily consumption of other foods and their alcohol intake.


Table 5 estimates GHQ mental distress equations for England. The key finding is that the
existence of a fruit-and-vegetable gradient in mental well-being is unaffected by the
inclusion of variables for the consumption of fish, meat and alcohol. For example, in column
3 of Table 5, those consuming 6-7 portions of fruit and vegetables a week have the best
mental health (the coefficient is -0.8576 with a t-statistic of 3.56). The meat and fish
dummy variables are not as strong in a well-being equation as might have been anticipated.
Eating no fish whatsoever, however, is associated with worse mental well-being. We tried
various specifications, and all of them left the fruit-and-vegetable gradient essentially
unaffected.


As perhaps might be expected, there is a non-linear relationship between mental well-being
and the consumption of alcohol. Those who drink on one-to-two days a week have the
lowest level of GHQ psychological disorders (in Table 5’s final column).            There is no
statistically significant difference between the GHQ score of a non-drinker and someone
who drinks alcohol almost every day.


                                              9
5. Further replication using other kinds of well-being measures


Table 6 offers evidence from a third source of data. Here the sample is approximately
50,000 men and women who live in Wales, using merged data from the four years 2007-
2010 of the Welsh Health Survey. Three new dependent variables are employed in Table 6.
They are coded from people’s answers to: How much of the time during the past 4 weeks
....1) Have you been happy? 2) Have you been very nervous? 3) Have you felt downhearted
and low? - None of the time; a little of the time; some of the time; most of the time; all of the
time? Here the means and standard deviations are, for the three well-being measures, as
follows:
Happiness                             Mean = 3.7, SD = 0.91
Nervous                               Mean = 1.7, SD = 0.97
Downhearted and low                   Mean = 1.9, SD = 1.01.


Despite the fact that these are different well-being dependent variables from those
employed earlier, the three columns of Table 6 reveal a fruit-and-vegetables gradient of the
previous kind. Well-being peaks at 7-8 portions for the happiness variable, at 4-5 portions
for the nervousness variable, and at 7-8 portions for the downhearted variable.


6. Conclusions


Human beings, like all animals, are fuelled by the food and liquid they consume. Yet the
literature on well-being has largely ignored the nature of people’s diets.


This study is an examination of the possible connections between healthy eating and human
well-being. Its results are suggestive. In each of three data sets, and for seven different
measures of mental well-being, we find evidence for the existence of a positive association
between well-being and fruit-and-vegetable consumption. This relationship holds both
before and after correction for a large number of possible confounders. Our data sets come
from Great Britain and it will be important to check such findings in a wide range of other
nations (a start on that is made in US data in Blanchflower and Oswald 2011, Table 2).


                                            10
This study complements a large literature on, and evidence of a long-known connection
between, physical health and the consumption of fruit and vegetables. For well-being
researchers, a contribution of the current study is to direct attention towards the potentially
important area of variety in food consumption -- and especially to the nature of different
foods.   In retrospect, such a point might appear a natural and even obvious one.
Nevertheless, as explained earlier, it has not figured in the tradition of research on
subjective well-being stretching back to, for example, the writings of Edward Diener and
Richard Easterlin.


The estimated coefficients in our study are substantial. When comparing small and large
levels of fruit and vegetable consumption per day, the effect corresponds -- for example in
the third column of Table 1 -- to between one quarter and one third of a life-satisfaction
point.   To put that in perspective, the known (huge) effect of being unemployed
corresponds to -0.9 of a life-satisfaction point. Some of our estimated effects are larger.


For policy-makers and researchers, various reactions are possible. One way to respond to
this evidence is to argue that the present results act to buttress the importance of the
status-quo policy of so-called 5-a-day healthy-eating targets. Our findings are consistent
with the need for high levels of fruit-and-vegetable consumption for mental health and not
merely for physical health. In some of our regression equations, the coefficients continue to
increase up to 7-8 portions a day. In a few they flatten off at, or above, 5 portions a day. In
particular instances in our regression-equation tables, it is not possible to reject the null
hypothesis that the coefficients in a well-being regression equation are the same between,
for example, 5 portions a day and 7 portions a day. More research will be required here.
Another potential response, and one that the authors of this study would themselves
favour, is to argue that the present study is suggestive, that there are grounds for informing
health professionals of the strength of this correlation (with caveats about the lack here of
clinching causal evidence), and that the pattern deserves scrutiny in longitudinal data. A
further potential reaction, and one consistent with the third, is to argue that there seem
grounds here for the funding of randomized trials to explore the consequences for mental
health of different levels of fruit-and-vegetable consumption.


                                            11
Because of the cross-sectional nature of our data, it is sensible to emphasize, first, the need
for extreme caution in the interpretation of this study’s findings, and, second, the likely
desirability in the long-run of randomized controlled trials of different kinds of diets. Our
findings can be at best only suggestive of any causal relationship. Nevertheless, the general
avenue explored here -- that of thinking harder about the types of foods consumed by
human beings -- appears to be a potentially valuable one for social scientists and perhaps
also eventually for governments concerned with the ultimate happiness of their citizens.
These issues seem to merit future inquiry.

               GHQ Definition

               In the GHQ measure, individuals answer 12 separate mental-distress questions: “Have you
               lost much sleep over worry?”; “Been able to concentrate on things?”; “Felt you are playing a
               useful part in things?”; “Felt capable of making decisions about things?”; “Felt constantly
               under strain?”; “Felt you could not overcome your difficulties?”; “Been able to enjoy your
               normal day-to-day activities”; “Been able to face up to your problems”; “Been feeling
               unhappy and depressed?”; “Been losing confidence in yourself?”; “Been thinking of yourself
               as a worthless person?”; “Been feeling reasonably happy all things considered?”. People in
               the surveys are asked to answer on a scale from ‘much more than usual’ down to ‘much less
               than usual’.
