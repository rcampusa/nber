                 Should   Social Security Be mans   Tested?




                                  ABSTRACT




      The provision of social security benefits to retirees distorts the saving
 decisions of workers who are rational enough to save for their future. Since the
 implicit rate of return in an unfunded social security program is less than the
 marginal product of capital, the resulting decline in saving causes a welfare
 loss. It has been suggested that this welfare loss could be reduced, while still
protecting those who lack the foresight to save for their retirement (the
 "myopes" and "partial myopes" of the paper), by replacing the current universal
social security program with a means-tested program that pays benefits only to
the "myopic" individuals who have little or no other retirement income or
assets.
      The present paper evaluates this suggestion with the help of an explicit
steady-state welfare comparison of the optimal universal and optimal
means-tested programs. The relative welfare levels depend on characteristics of
the economy (the growth rates of population and real wages and the productivity
of capital) and of the population (the frequency and degree of myopia with
respect to saving for retirement).
      The analysis shows that, although a means tested program is generally
superior, it does not always dominate the best alternative universal program.
A universal program can be preferable under conditions which imply that the
optimal means-tested program would induce rational savers to stop saving. The
analysis also implies that overall welfare can be increased by using different
social security programs for different groups of workers if the working
population as a whole can be divided into two or more subgroups with different
mixes of myopes, partial myopes and rational life-cycle savers.

      Every society must solve the problem of supporting those individuals who

 become too old to work but have not made adequate provision for their own old

age by saving when they were young. At the present time, the major

 industrial countries of the world have responded to this problem by creating

social security programs that tax the working population and use the proceeds

to provide a "universal" benefit to all retirees regardless of their

financial condition.

     This universal provision of social security benefits distorts the saving

decisions of those workers who are rational enough to plan for the future.2

Since the implicit rate of return that taxpayers get on their contributions

to an unfunded social security program is less than the return available on

    2For a discussion of the effect of promised retirement benefits on the
savings of employees, see Feldstein (1974, 1982a). Barro (1974, 1978) has
discussed an interesting special case in which social security would have no
effect on private saving. His conclusion requires that each individual acts
to maximize a utility function that has as one of its arguments the utility of
his children, and that the initial optimum behavior involves a positive amount
of bequest. Of course, if everyone exhibited such rationality, there would be
rio need or justification for social security retirement benefits. The Barro
conditions imply that social security does not change aggregate savings but
some individuals may save more while others save less. Every individual's
savings will be unchanged only if all individuals in each current and future
generation are alike. [Footnote continued on next page]

 savings invested in real capital,3 the individual who substitutes social

 security tax Contributions for private savings suffers a welfare loss equal to

 the present value of the difference between the social security benefits and

 the amount of future income that the displaced savings would have earned.4

 The basic problem of designing a social security program is to set the level

 of benefits (and the conditions for receiving benefits) in the way that best

 balances the desirability of protecting those who would otherwise make

 inadequate provisions for their old age against the cost of reduced saving by

 those who would otherwise save in a rational way.5



      Feldstein (1974) showed that the provision of social security benefits
that are conditional on retirement can increase personal saving if the effect
on saving of the induced increase in retirement outweighs the asset
substitution effect. Sheshinskj and Weiss (1981), Abel (1984) and Hubbard
 (1984) examine the implications of uncertain mortality and the absence of
perfect annuity markets f or the effect of social security on saving.
      Although there is a wide range of empirical estimates of the effect of
social security on private saving, the bulk of the evidence appears to this
author to support the conclusion that increases in social security benefits
reduce private saving. Studies supporting this conclusion include Blinder,
Gordon and Wise (1983) and Diamond and Hausman (1984). Those who find little
or no effect of social security on savings include Lesnoy and Learner (1982)
and Munnell (1975).

    3Paul Samuelson's (1958) classic article showed that the implicit rate
of return in an unfunded social security program is the rate of growth of
aggregate wages. Samuelson considered the special case in which real wages
per worker are constant, making the implicit rate of return on social
security equal to the rate of growth of population.

    4See Feldstejn (1982b). There is a further source of welfare loss to the
rational individual if the social security program distorts labor supply
either during working years (because the reward to working is reduced by the
social security tax to an extent that is not compensated by the present value
of future benefits) or at an age when retirement is possible (because
potential benefits are reduced in whole or in part if the individual
continues to work.) See Gustman and Steinmeier (1983) and Danziger et al.
(1981) for recent discussions of these issues. The present analysis
abstracts from these issues by assuming that the quantity of labor supplied
and the age of retirement are both fixed.

    5Feldstein(1985a) derives the optimal level of social security benefits in
a universal social security program for two alternative specifications of
                                       —3—


       Milton Friedman (1972) and others have suggested that the common system

  of universal eligibility for social security retirement benefits be replaced

 by a means-tested program that pays benefits only to those who lack assets

 or private pension income with which to finance adequate post-retirement

 consumption. Proponents of this change argue that limiting benefits only to

 those in financial need would reduce the size of the program and therefore

 the distortionary effect of the tax that is used to pay for it.   It is also

 argued that, since rational savers would receive no benefits, their
                                                                        saving
 would be influenced only by the presumably modest amount of tax that they pay

 to finance the means-tested benefits. Despite the potential magnitude of the

 welfare gain, the proposal for a means-tested program has not previously been

 the subject of theoretical or empirical analysis.

      Some social security specialists oppose switching to a means-tested

 program because, they argue, there is a stigma attached to accepting

means—tested benefits which is undesirable in itself and which discourages

eligible individuals from applying for benefits. In addition, eligible

individuals may fail to receive benefits because they do not understand that

they are entitled to benefits.6

     In assessing these arguments it is of course difficult to know how much

value to place on avoiding the stigma per se that accompanies means-tested

benefits. it is in principle easier to evaluate the welfare cost of

individuals' failure to apply for means-tested benefits because of such



imperfect foresight. For evidence on the significance of inadequate
retirement savings, see Diamond (1977) and Kotlikoff et al. (1982).

    6See Cohen (1972). For more general discussions of social security
policy and proposals for reform, see Boskin (1977), Feldstein (1975, 1977,
1985b), and Munnell (1977).

stigma or because of ignorance of eligibility. Moreover, experience with

other means—tested and conditional programs suggests that the utilization

rate of means-tested retirement benefits by eligible individuals would

increase over time and could be raised by education and advertising. The

potential gains to rational savers of switching the program to a means—tested

basis makes it worthwhile to look beyond the stigma issue and to evaluate

more formally the choice between universal and means-tested programs. That

is the purpose of the present paper.

     The analysis shows that there may be a strong case for a means-tested

program but that it is more ambiguous than the casual analysis of Friedman

and others would suggest. Although a means-tested program may be smaller in

total size than a universal program, it does not necessarily produce greater

social welfare even when the implicit return on social security taxes is

substantially lower than the return available on private saving. The analysis

in this paper shows two reasons why an optimal program of universal

unconditional benefits would, under certain conditions, provide a higher level

of social welfare than an optimal program of benefits conditioned by a

means-test.

     The principal reason that a universal program may be superior is that a

means-tested program with benefits set at the optimal level may induce some

utility—maximizing workers to save nothing. Although their resulting

consumption in retirement would then be less than they would have chosen

without a social security program, the utility value of the extra consumption

during working years more than offsets the reduced consumption during

retirement. For these individuals, the means-tested program distorts savings
                                     —5—


and reduces individual utility by more than a universal program. If that

group is large enough in the population, the universal program may be more

desirable than a means-tested program.

     It is also possible for the universal program to be superior even if the

benefits in the alternative means-tested program are set at a level that does

not induce any utility-maximizing workers to stop saving. This can occur

if, in order to avoid inducing the utility—maximizers to stop saving, the

level of the means-tested benefits has to be set substantially lower than

would otherwise be optimal. In this case, switching from a universal program

to a means-tested program reduces the welfare of those who receive the

constrained means-tested benefits by more than it increases the welfare of

the nonrecipients.

     In general, the choice between a means-tested program and a universal

program depends on the parameters of the economy (in particular the growth

rates of income and population and the rate of return on real investments)

and on the character and extent of economic shortsightedness among the

working population. The nature of this dependence is examined in the present

paper. The specific results in the very simple models examined here are of

course only suggestive but they do indicate some important qualitative

properties that may be robust and suggest a framework for a more realistic

detailed analysis.

     The fact that the optimal choice between a means-tested program and a

universal program depends on the character of the working population has an

important general implication for the design of social security programs. It

implies that, if the working population can be subdivided into groups that
                                        -6-•



differ in the relevant parameters, it may be optimal to have a means-tested

program for some groups and a universal program for others. The specific

implications of this are discussed in the final section of the present paper.



1.   The Optimal Program in a Two Class Society

     It is useful to begin the analysis with the simple case in which workers

are either fully rational life—cycle utility maximizers (or "cyclers" for

short) or completely myopic individuals who always consume their entire net

income ("myopes"). in this case, a means-tested program will produce higher

social welfare than a universal program unless the level of means-tested

benefits must be reduced substantially below the unconstrained optimum in

order to prevent the cyclers from becoming non-savers. Such a constraint may

be binding because allowing the cyclers to become non—savers would imply that

the means-tested program was no longer selective but provided benefits to all

retirees. The present section shows conditions under which such a constraint

causes the universal program to be optimal. It also develops the basic

structure of the analysis that is then extended in the next section to deal

with a more heterogeneous population in which an optimal means-tested program

will induce workers with limited myopia to stop saving.

     The analysis is set in an overlapping generations model of the type

developed by Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965). Individuals live for two

periods, working in the first and being fully retired in the second. At time

t there are Lt workers and Lt_i retirees. The population grows at rate n

per period, implying that Lt =                  Real wages per worker grow at rate
                                 (1+n)Lt...i.

               (1+g)w1.
                                               —7—


      It will simplify notation and interpretation in the analysis that follows

 if we define x =    (1+n)(1+g)/(1+r),       the ratio of "one plus the growth rate of

aggregate wages" to "one plus the rate of return on capital." Since the

growth rate of aggregate wages is the implicit rate of return on social

security, x measures the efficiency of social security "saving" relative to

savings invested in real capital.

      A fraction i   of   workers are myopes who always consume their entire

earnings during their working period. The remaining 1i choose a saving

level during their working years that maximizes lifetime utility, u(Cit,

C2t+i) where C1.     is   consumption in period t of workers and C2.1 is

consumption of retirees in period t+1. To be able to derive explicit values

of consumption and utility, I shall assume that the lifetime utility function

is loglinear: u(Cit,      C2t+i)   =   ln   C1. +   in

1.1 A Universal Social Security Program

      When there is a universal social security program, the government levies

a tax at rate e on wages and uses the proceeds to finance concurrent

benefits of b to each retiree. The budget constraint of a universal social

security program is

(1)      t'-t =   bLt_1
or

(2)      b = (1+n)8w.
      Myopes consume        =
                                (1—e)w during their working years and C21 =          b1
when they are retired. Cyclers choose C1 to maximize lifetime utility
subject to the personal budget constraint C21 = ((1—e)w- C1)(1+r) +

Optimal first period consumption is therefore C =                          +
                                                             o.5[(1-e)wt       b1/(1+r)]
                                        —8—


and the corresponding second period consumption is            =

0.5[(1—e)w(1+r) + b1]. Using the government's budget constraint (equation 2)
to write b1 =                 =
                  (1+n)8w+i (1+n)(1+g)ew and recalling that
x =   (1+n)(1+g)/(1+r) is the efficiency of social security savings,   yields

C 0.5[(1—e) + ex]w and C÷1= 0.5{(1—e) + ex](1+r)w.
      Total utility at time t is the sum of the utilities of the Lt workers and

the Lti retirees. With a program of universal social security benefits,

total utility at time t iS:


(3)      W = L[gi   ln(1_e)W + (1—ji) ln 0.5(1—8 + 8x)w]

            + Lt 1[t.i in b + (1—li) ln 0.5(1—8 + 8x)(1+r)w1]



After substituting b =
                          (1+n)8w and w1 =     w/(l+g).   it is possible to

factor out Lti and in w. and write


(4)      W = Lt   1[(1+n) .t1n (1—8) + (1+n)(1—ji) in 0.5 (1—8 + ex)

            + g.z ln(1+n)8 + (1—gi) in 0.5(1—8 + ex)(1+r)(1+g)]

            + L1(2+n) in


Since the terms including 8 are in the square brackets and do not change from

period to period, the value of e that maximizes W is the same as the value

that maximizes total utility in any other period.7 I shall assume that the

government wishes to choose 8 to maximize this total utility.8



    7Except for the initial period when the program is started. In that
period, retirees get windfall benefits that they never paid for. This is
discussed in Feidstein (1985a, pp. 310—314).

    8The government might instead choose 8 to maximize the discounted value of
utility in all years including the initial period. Ignoring the initial
period is equivalent to assuming that the discount rate that the government
applies in aggregating utilities is relatively low so that the initial period

       The first order condition for the value e* that maximizes total utility is9

 (5)
             e*         1_e*            1-(1_x)e*

 The qualitative implications of this condition are easily established by

 totally differentiating equation 5. It is easily shown in this way that

d9*/d > 0, dO*/dx > 0 and dO*/dn < 0.                   Before interpreting these it is useful

to derive also the effects of the parameters on the optimal value of the per
                                      u*
worker benefits. Since bt =                                 it follows immediately that db /di > 0
                                           e*(i+n)w,
       u*
and db /dx > 0.              The sign of db /dn is ambiguous and depends on the value of

the other parameters.

       It is easy to interpret these properties. Since an increase in the

fraction of myopes increases the number of individuals who gain from a higher

level of the universal benefit and decreases the number who lose, it raises

the optimal benefit level (db*/diA >                0) and therefore the corresponding tax
rate (d8*/dgi >        0).     An increase in the relative efficiency of social security

in comparison to real investment, i.e., a rise in the ratio of the implicit

rate of return on social security to the rate of return on real capital,

reduces the cost to the cyclers of the compulsory social security program and

therefore raises the optimal level of both benefits (db(*/dx >                   0) and taxes
(d8*/dgi >   0).       Finally, since an increase in the relative number of workers




gets little weight or that the sum does not converge so that it is only
meaningful to maximize the utility of a representative year. Feldstein
(1985a) develops the discounted value and discusses these issues more
explicitly. If the government's utility discount rate is less than
(1+g)(1+n)-1, the discounted sum of utilities does riotconverge and the
government must maximize the representative value of W.

    9The second order condition is satisfied for all feasible parameter
values.

permits a given level of benefits to be achieved with a lower tax rate,

d8*/d(1+n) <    0.
       Table 1 presents specific numerical values of 0* and of the resulting

level of welfare1° for a range of values of ii and x. To limit the dimension of

the table, the calculations are done for a single value of n based on U.S.

experience. The value of n represents the rate of labor force growth for a

generation, which I will take to be 30 years. Since the U.S. population

grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent for the three decades beginning

in 1950, I shall take (1+n) = (1.014)30 =         1.52.
       The value of x =   (1+g)(1+n)/(1+r)   that corresponds to U.S. experience

during these years to x =    0.115.     This reflects the annual labor force growth

of 1.4 percent, an annual rate of growth of real compensation per hour of

2.2 percent and a pretax real rate of return on U.S. nonfinancial corporate

capital of 11.4 percent.11         Together these imply x =   [(1.014)(1.022)I(1.114)]30
=   0.115.   Reducing the population growth rate to zero and the rate of real

compensation growth to 0.32 percent (the average for the most recent decade,

1974—84) cuts the relative efficiency of social security to x =        0.043.   In

contrast, maintaining the values of g and n but cutting the projected real

rate of return in half (from 0.114 to 0.057) raises the relative efficiency of

social security to x =    0.553.    The tabulations in Table 1 are presented for

these three values and for selected values of i between 0.1 and 1.0.

        The optimal tax rates shown in column 1 increase with the relative

frequency of myopes. With the historic value of x = 0.115, the optimal tax

rate increase from            =   0.044 when only 10 percent of the poulation are myopes
to       =    0.363 when 90 percent of the population are myopes. In the limiting

case in which everyone is myopic, e =            (2+n)   =   0.396; this corresponds to
the tax rate that distributes income equally between workers and myopes.

Although a lower efficiency of social security reduces the optimal value of

      the effect is not very substantial.



1.2 A Means-Tested Social Security Program

        If the social security program is means tested and the level of taxes and

benefits is set in a way that causes cyclers to save, benefits are paid only

to retired myopes and the budget constraint linking the tax rate (8) to the

level of means-tested benefits per beneficiary (bm) is


(6)          b =

since   only a fraction           of retirees receives benefits. The behavior of the

myopes is the same under a means-tested program as under the universal

program. They consume their entire disposable income while working

(C1t =       (l—e)w)   and depend exclusively on the benefits to finance consumption

during retirement (C2t+1 =
                                     bt+i).
      If the cyclers save, the level of means-tested benefits is irrelevant and

their behavior is affected only by the tax. They maximize u(C1. C2t+i) =

in       +
              lnL(1_8)w
                          —
                              Ci](1+r)   and therefore choose C =
                                                                      O.S(1-e)wt   and

C1 = O.5(1—9)w(1+r).
      Cyclers will save if the utility that results from this combination of
                                                            —12—



C1,              is greater than the utility of consuming their entire disposable

income while they are working and relying on the benefits to finance their

consumption. That is, cyciers choose to save if and only if


(7)       in O.S(1_e)wt +                 in   O.5(1_e)wt(1+r) >     in(1—8)w
                                                                                +   in
                                                                                         bt+j

Since bt =                            and w. =                     this inequality condition can be
              11'(1÷n)ew                            (l+g)wt_1
written


(8)       in 0.5(1—8) +              in   0.5(1—8)(1+r) > iri(1—8) +       in(1+n)(1+g)e        —   in   ji




After   rearranging terms, this implies that cyclers save if and only if

(9)       ln(1) > in                x + 2 in 2 —      in   ji




       This   inequality condition is important because it indicates the maximum

value at which 8 can be set in a means-tested program:


(10)      e        =
           max             i.t+4x



This maximum tax rate implies a maximum value for the ratio of the benefits

paid to myopes (and therefore their level of retirement consumption) to the

retirement consumption of cyclers. Since                            =   j2 e(1+n)    and

O.S(1—e)w1(1+r). the ratio of benefits to the retirement consumption of

cyclers iS:

              bt       = __________________
(11)
                            O.5(1_8)w1(1+r)
                       -       28x
                            (1-e)gi
                                               -13—


Substituting 8max from equation 10 yields

              bt
(12)                    =   0.5.
              2,t max

Thus the maximum level of benefits consistent with continued saving by the

cyclers is one-half of the level of consumption that the cyclers would obtain

by their optimal saving. While this simple result reflects the particular

loglinear utility, it illustrates how the level of benefits may have to be

constrained significantly in a means—tested program in order to keep cyclers

saving.

       The value of 8max increases with the relative number of myopes but less

than proportionately, implying that the maximum benefits in a means—tested

program varies inversely with the number of myopes. The value of e also

varies inversely with x, implying that the maximum tax is reduced as the

benefits produced by any level of tax increases. For example, with x = 0.115,

       rises from       = 0.30     at ji   = 0.2   to 8max =   0.52   at ji   = 0.5   and

8max =   0.63 at u = 0.8.      Similarly, with i =        0.2,   emax rises from emax = 0.083

at x =   0.553 to 8max = 0.30 at x = 0.115 and emax = 0.538 at x = 0.043.
       If the value 8* that maximizes total utility on the assumption that

cyclers save exceeds emax. the value 8* is irrelevant and the feasible

optimum value for a means-tested program is emax.12




   12A means-tested program in which cyclers do not save is, ex post, a
universal program. Such a program is dominated by an ex ante universal
program in which cyclers do some saving.
                                           —14—


       The analysis now proceeds by deriving, for different parameter

combinations, the optimal tax value (8*) on the assumption that cyclers save.

If 8*     8max' the total utility is calculated at 8*; if 8* >
                                                                        8max' total
utility is calculated at 8max These total utility values for a means—tested

program can then be compared to the total utility values for the universal

program to decides whether the means-tested program or the universal program

provides the higher level of total utility.

       Total utility at time t under the means-tested program can be written as

the sum of the utilities of the Lt workers and Lt_i retirees as:13


             =
(13)
                 Lt[i   ln(1—8)wt + (1—11) ln O.5(1_e)w]

             +
                 Lt1[i    ln b + (1—n) in O.5(1—8)(1+r)w1).



After substituting b =
                             J1(1+n)ew and w1 = w/(1+g)            total utility can be

written as


             =           in 8 + (2+n—i) in (1—8) — (2+n)(1—j.t)ln 2
(14)
                 Lti(M
             +   in   (1+n) — p in p - (1—p) in x] +
                                                       Lt_i(2+n)   in

                                       -15--




       Once again a constant value of e maximizes W1 in each period. The first

order condition for the means—tested program implies



(15)


and, since * =          =




(16)       m   2+n


This result is very striking. It implies that the optimal benefit—wage ratio

depends only on the rate of population growth and is independent of the

frequency of myopes in the population and the relative efficiency of social

security and real investment.

       This striking conclusion is easily explained. A means—tested social

security program is equivalent to a redistribution of income from all workers

to those retirees who have no private assets. As such, it is a problem in

optimal income redistribution. With no distorting effect of the tax or the

benefit on labor supply or saving,14 the tax should be used to redistribute

income until the marginal utility of a dollar of additional income for the

working generation equals the marginal utility of a dollar to the retired

myopes. The relative efficiency of private saving and social security at

converting present to future income (x) is irrelevant. And while the relative

number of myopes influences the tax rate required to support the benefits, it

does not alter the optimal level of benefits (* is independent of IA).




   14The tax reduces the saving of the cyclers by reducing their disposable
income but there is no substitution effect distortion.
                                                    -16-


        Substituting this value of 8* into equation 14 yields an expression for

 the optimal level of total utility in an unconstrained means—tested program:



 (17)       W= L1[(2+n-.) in (2+n—i) — (2+n) in (2+n)

                  —
                       (2+n)(1—i) in 2 + ln(1+n)      —
                                                           (1—ji) in x + (2+n) in


        Of course, if 8* =          i/(2+n)   >       of   equation 10, the feasible maximum
              m
value of              is lower than       and must be calculated by substituting 8max into

equation 14. Since °max =              i/(i+4x),    this saving constraint 8max <      8*   wili be

binding unless i/(i+4x) <             z/(2+n).     Equivalently, the unconstrained

0* =    ii/(2+n)      must be replaced by 8max =      /(4x) whenever i > 2+n-4x.            With
n =   0.52,   the constraint is binding only for high values of u or x. For

example, with x =          0.553,   the constraint is binding for gi         0.31. With
x     0.63, the constraint is always binding. While with x <                  0.38,   the

constraint is never binding.

        When the constraint -is not binding, total utility for the means tested

program -is always greater than total utility for the universal program.

Although this apparently cannot be shown analytically because the optimal

value of 8 for the universal program -is only defined implicitly by equation 5,

it can be shown by calculating the optimal values of 8u and 8m and the

resulting total utility measure numerically for all conceivable values of t

and x [0                1.0 and 0 <   x    1.0] and for values of n corresponding to

annual population growth rates between zero and three percent (0                      n     1.43).

        Even when the constraint on the optimal means-tested tax rate is binding

(8* >                 the total utility for the means tested program may still be
        8max'
                                        —17—


higher than total utility for the universal program. The universal program

provides a higher level of total utility only when the constraint on the level

of benefits given to the myopes in the means-tested program depresses their

utility below what they would get in an optimal universal program by more than

enough to outweigh the greater adverse effects on the cyclers of a universal

program.

     Explicit numerical comparison shows that the universal program is optimal

only for high values of x and relatively high values of j.t.    Moreover, the
greater the relative efficiency of social security (i.e., the higher the value

of x), the lower is the relative frequency of myopes in the population at

which the universal program becomes optimal. For example, although the

constraint on e can be binding at x =   0.4,   it is only binding if p >   0.92   and,

even then it is never optimal to use a universal program.15 When x =       0.6,    the

constraint on e is binding for p as low as 0.12 but the universal program is

only optimal at values of p greater than 0.22. Figure 1 shows the

combinations of x and p values at which the universal program is optimal (the

upper triangle) and the wider set of x and p values at which the constraint on

e is binding but the means-tested program remains optimal (including the upper

triangle and t e area between the two lines). The area at the bottom shows

the range of x and p values for which the constraint is not binding and the

means—tested program is optimal.

     Note that with the historic measure of social security efficiency




   15This calculation assumes the historic rate of population growth of 1.4
percent a year.
                                          —18-


 (x =    0.115),   the universal program is never optimal. This conclusion remains

 true for all rates of population growth. For the combinations of     ji   and x

 reported in Table 1, the universal program is optimal only for x = 0.553 and
   =    0.9.   Recall that x = 0.553 corresponds to cutting the real rate of return

 on capital in half. But even with this extreme assumption, the universal

 program is optimal only if myopes constitute nearly all of the population.

        This conclusion about the general dominance of the means—tested program

depends of course on the simplified characterization of the population as

either pure cyclers or pure myopes. In the richer model of the next section,

there is more scope for a universal program to dominate.



2. The Optimal Program When Benefits Distort Saving

        A social security program that pays means-tested benefits to only a

fraction of retirees cannot distort saving in an economy with only two types

of individuals. With only two types of individuals, the level of taxes and

benefits can be set in a way that achieves perfect separation between myopes

and cyclers. Nyopes save nothing and depend on benefits while cyclers save

in a way that is influenced by the level of potential benefits. Under these

circumstances, a means-tested program will be optimal unless achieving

separation requires a substantial restraint on the level of benefits.

       In an economy with more than two types of individuals, a separation that

does not distort saving is not always a characteristic of an optimal

means-tested program. The analysis in this section shows that the optimal

level of means-tested benefits may cause some individuals who are neither

completely myopic nor perfectly rational life-cycle utility maximizers to stop
                                      —19-


saving and rely exclusively on social security benefits. For these

 individuals, the reduction in saving is greater than it would be with a

universal program. If they are sufficiently important in the population, the

total utility of a means-tested program may be lower than the total utility

of a universal program. The current analysis examines the characterization

of the economy and of the population that influences this choice.

     The analysis of the previous section can be extended to deal with this

more general case by intoducing a third class of individuals who are

partially myopic, that is, who give too little weight to their future utility

when they make savings decisions during their working years. More

specifically, I will assume that a fraction TI of the population acts during

their working years to maximize inC1 +           with A <   1   even though their
                                         AlnC2
true lifetime utility is given by inC1 +
                                            inC2.   In Pigou's (        ) words,
these partial myopes have a "faulty telescopic faculty" that causes them to

give too little weight to future utility.

     As before, it is useful to begin by analyzing the effects of a universal

social security program and calculating the total utility level that results

from an optimal universal program. The optimal means-tested program can then

be derived and the resulting total utility level compared with that of the

universal program.


2.1 An Optimal Universal Social Security ProQram

     The budget constraint of a universal social security program is the same

in the current three-class economy as it was in the simple economy of the

previous section:
                                               —20-


 (18)                e(1+r).

        The fundamental difference between the previous section and the current

 one lies in the behavior of the partial myopes. The partial myopes choose

 their first period consumption by maximizing in C1. + A in C21 subject to

 the personal budget constraint         C21 = [(l_8)wt_Cit](11r)   +
                                                                       bt+1.   This

 implies first period consumption of



 (19)        C = (1+A)'[(1_e)w          +
                                            bi/(1+r)]
Using the government budget constraint (18) to eliminate bt and recalling

that x =    (li-g)(1+n)/(1+r)    measures the efficiency of social security, the

first-period consumption of the partial myopes can be written:



(20)             =   (1+A)[1—e     +
                                       ex]w.

Their consumption during retirement can be written:


                      =            —
(21)
                          E(1—ew       C](1+r)   +
                                                      bt+i
                     =
                          j-    (1+r)w(1_8 + ex)


        Although the partial myopes choose their consumption levels by

maximizing in C1. + A in                 the proper social valuation of the total

utility of the consumption of the partial myopes living at time t is

liLt in C+ II Lt_j in C where II is the fraction of partial myopes in the

population. The consumption behavior and utility level of the pure myopes

and the pure cyclers is the same as in the previous section. Total utility

at time t with the universal social security program can therefore be written

When there are no partial myopes (fl=O)., equation 24 is equivalent to equation 4

of the previous section.

        Consider now the value of e that maximizes totai utility with this

universal program. Since the terms in equation 24 that include e do not

involve either II or A, it follows immediately that the optimal value of e is
                                               —22-


 independent of the relative number of partial myopes or of their degree of

 myopia. It can be verified directly by differentiating W with respect to e

 that the optimal tax rate in the universal program satisfies


 '25'             —   (1+n)i   - (2+n)(1—ji)(1—x) ——
             0*        1-0*        1_(1_x)8*

 This is exactly the same as the optimum condition of equation 5 for an

economy with no partial-myopes.16

        The values of 8* corresponding to different values of   and x that are

presented in Table 1 can therefore be used to evaluate the total utility level

given by equation 24. These maximum values for the total utility achievable

with an optimal universal social security program can then be compared with

the corresponding maximum values that can be attained with a means—tested

program. Before presenting the total utility levels implied by equation 24,

it is therefore useful to analyze the means-tested program.


2.2 A Means-Tested Program With Partial Myopes

        A universal program of social security benefits reduces the saving of

all individuals who save to finance future consumption, including both pure

life—cyclers and partial myopes.17 In contrast, a means-tested program reduces

saving only if it induces individuals to cut their saving in order to qualify



   16This simplifying property is a result of the loglinear nature of the
utility function. It follows directly from equations 20 and 21 that changes
in 8 alter utility in a way that does not depend on the value of A. The
effect of B on utility is therefore the same for partial—myopes and for pure
life—cyclers. Therefore only the relative number of pure myopes is relevant
to determining the optimal value of 0.

   17This is in addition to the reduction in saving caused by the reduction
in disposable income that results from the tax. The discussion in the
remainder of the paragraph also ignores this tax effect and focuses on the
substitution of benefits for private wealth accumulation.
                                      —23—


 for the means—tested benefit. In order to analyze this possibility, I will

 assume that benefits are provided only to individuals who do not save at

 all.18 Interest then focuses on the possibility that the partial—myopes

 choose to stop saving and rely only on the benefits to finance retirement

 consumption. Since the level of benefits that induces such substitution may

 not be high enough to induce full life cyclers to stop saving, the result may

be a means—tested program in which only some retirees receive benefits but in

which a substantial number of people substitute social security benefits for

private saving.

     The analysis that follows shows that the means—tested program may be

preferred to a universal program even when partial myopes are induced to

become nonsavers. A means-tested program is preferable to a universal

program under a wide range of parameter values. But the possibility of

inducing partial myopes to become nonsavers does increase the range of

economic parameter values in which a universal program is preferred to a

means-tested program. The implications of this are discussed more fully in

the concluding section of the paper. But first the formal -results must be

derived and analyzed.

     In the simpler case in which individuals are either pure myopes or pure

cyclers, I derived the maximum value of B that was consistent with continued

saving by the cyclers. In the current context, two separate sets of

conditions must be derived in order to evalute total utility. In the first

case, the value of B is such that both the cyclers and the partial—myopes



   181f the means-tested program provided full benefits to partial-myopes,
there would be no basis for analyzing the substitution of benefits for
private saving. A more complex means—tested program that provided partial
benefits to individuals with private assets but with less than a 100 percent
effective tax rate would be worth analyzing.
                                                  —24-


 continue to save. In the second case, the value of e is such that only the

 cyclers continue to save and the partial myopes are induced to substitute

 benefits for private wealth accumulation. For each set of parameter values

 (jl,   x,   n, A and 11), both cases must be evaluated separately and the

 corresponding values of total utility calculated. The higher utility value

 indicates the optimum means-tested program. This total utility value can

 then be compared with the value of the corresponding universal program.

        Consider first the conditions under which both cyclers and partial

myopes save. Cyclers choose to save if and only if the utility that results

 from saving exceeds the utility of consuming all disposable income and

relying on benefits to finance retirement consumption. This condition is

exactly the same as equation 7 of section 1:



(26)           in O.5(]._e)w +      in   o.5(1_e)w(1+r) >

                     ln(1_e)w   +    in bt+i.

Since in this case benefits are paid only to myopes, the government's budget

constraint implies bt =
                                1e(1+n)w        and cyclers save if


(27)           in O.5(1_e)w + in O.5(1—O)wt(1+r) >

                     ln(1_e)w   +   in   st 1e(1+n)(1+g)w.


Solving this implies that cyclers will save oniy if e is less than


(28)
               max    I1+4x


just as in the previous section. This maximum value of 8 is denoted 8ax to

emphasize that it is the highest value of 8 consistent with saving by the

cyclers.
                                           —25—


       The maximum value of 9 that is consistent with continued saving by the

 partial myopes can be derived in a similar way. Partial myopes save only if

the resulting lifetime utility (as they perceive it, with weight A given to

second period utility) exceeds the liftime utility that results if all

disposable income is consumed. If the partial myopes do reject the benefits

and save, their consumption is chosen to maximize in C1 + A        ln C21
subject to          =
                        ((1_e)wt_C1)(1+r).     This implies C1 =
                                                                   (1)(1)wt
and therefore that the perceived lifetime utility is ln (1+Ai'(1_9)w +

A    ln(1_(1+A))(1_9)w(1+r). The partial myopes therefore save if and only

if



(29)      ln(1+A)(1_e)wt +      A In (A/(1+A))(1_e)w(1+r) >              + A in bti.
                                                              in(1-9)w

Note again that, with partial myopes saving, benefits are paid only to pure

myopes and therefore bt =                     Substituting for bt+i and factoring
                               M1e(1+n)w.
out w yields:


(30)        in (].+A)1(1—9) + A in(A/(1+A))(1—8) > ln(1—9) + A in         6x.


       Rearranging terms and solving implies the important condition that

partial myopes save19 if and only if 9 is less than


(31)        9A   — _________________

9 consistent with continued saving by partial myopes.2° Differentiating this



   19Th-is is conditional on saving by pure cyclers as well. As I note below,
pure cyciers always save if it is optimal for partial myopes to save.

    2O is easy to see (and perhaps reassuring) that with A=1 this is
equivalent to the value of 8max for pure cyclers presented in equation 28.
                                               —26-


 expression with respect to A shows that 8max rises monotonically with A for

 0 < A       1. This means that 8 <
                                         max   implies   8 <
                                                               max
                                                                     ; if   the value of 9 is

 low enough to keep partial—myopes saving, it is also low enough to keep

 cyclers saving.

       Before looking at the second case in which partial-myopes do not save,

 it is interesting to see the way in which the presence of partial myopes

reduces the maximum value of 8 (and the corresponding value of benefits) that

is consistent with leaving saving unchanged.21 For example, with the value of
x =   0.115 corresponding to U.S. experience of the past three decades, the

maximum tax rate consistent with unchanged saving drops from 8c  = 0.30
                                                             max
when ji = 0.2 to eA  = 0.11 when partial myopes have A =0.5 and to only

9max =      0.06 when partial myopes have A = 0.2.        The relative reductions are

only slightly smaller when the fraction of myopes is larger. For example,

when half of the population are myopes (gi            = 0.5), 8ax = 0.52       but declines

to
      max
            =   0.39 when partial myopes have A = 0.5 and 8A            =   0.23 when A = 0.2.
                                                                 max
Thus the maximum value of 9 consistent with unchanged saving drops

substantially when       there   are partial myopes whose initial level of saving is

relatively low.

      I turn therefore to the second case in which the level of 8 is high

enough to cause partial-myopes not to save but not so high that cyclers cease

saving. The values of e that define this range are not the values of eax

and
      max that have just been derived because they were derived using the
government constraint that holds when only the pure myopes are nonsavers.




   2LJnchanged saving refers to no substitution of benefits for private
saving. The tax per se will always alter saving.
                                                     —27-


Since the current case corresponds to providing benefits to partial myopes as

well as pure myopes, the government budget constraint becomes bt =

                 It then follows directly that the values of e that define the
e(1+n)w.
current range can be obtained by substituting t+fl for ji    in   the previously

derived expressions for                 and
                                 max          max
       More specifically, the cyclers will continue to save if and only if


(32)         8
                        it




Similarly,       the partial myopes will not save only if


(33)         8 >             X(i+fl)
                                        (1+X)/A
                   A(t+rI) +   x(1+A)
Since the right hand side of 33 is an increasing function of A for 0 < A           1,

it follows that there exists a range of values of e that satisfies both

inequalities:


                 i+fl                     (ji+11)A
(34)
             ji+fl+4x           (+fl)A +      x(1+A)(1)A
Expression 34 is the condition for the cyclers to save while the partial

myopes do not.

       The total utility equation depends on whether the maximum value of e

corresponds to the first or second case. Consider first the total utility

equation if only the pure myopes do not save. Total utility is then given by

For example, with the historic values of x = 0.115 and 1+n =                          1.52,   this

inequality will be satisfied for all values of A                        0.23 regardless of the

relative frequency of the pure myopes (gi).                    Thus unless partial myopes give

very little weight to future utility, the unconstrained optimal tax rate for

the means-tested program is consistent with continued saving by partial

myopes. At very low values of A, the opposite is true; with A <                           0.13,      the

inequality cannot be satisfied for any value of ji                     < 1.    Thus if partial myopes

put little enough weight on future utility, it may not be possible to have

partial myopes saving at the optimum value of 9*

 The first order condition for the optimum tax rate in the means-tested program

 when partial myopes behave like pure myopes is



 (42)
                     2+n


This is exactly analogous to the previously derived optimum tax rates for

programs except that p+IT now replaces gi because partial myopes behave like

pure myopes.

        This optimal value of 9* will be consistent with the limits of equation

34 on 8 that are required for cyclers to save while partial myopes do not save

if:

The second of these inequalities is satisfied for the historic values of n =

0.52 and x = 0.115         for all possible values of p+TI.            The first inequality is

satisfied for low values of A but not for high values. More precisely, with

the historic values, the first inequality is satisfied for A < 0.13 but is

never satisfied for A            0.23. Thus the double inequality that defines this case

in which partial myopes do not save at the optimal 9* is satisfied only f or a

rather narrow range of very low values of A if x and n take their historic

values. But with a higher value of x, the range of A values consistent with

nonsaving by the partial myopes is much broader. For example, with x = 0.553

(and n Continuing at 0.52), the first of the inequalities is satisfied for
                                                    —31—


values ranging to more than A =              0.8.    The double inequality is satisfied by

values between A = 0 and A =              0.6   for very low values of i+fl but is satisfied

for 0 < A         0.5 even at ji+fl =      0.5.
        Finally, it is possible that the value of 8 derived on the assumption

that only cyclers save will in fact cause even cyclers to want to stop saving.

Since this limit on 8 is given by equation 32 and the optimal value of 8 is

given by 42, we see that the constraint on 8 will be binding only if


(45)                 >
               2+n         i+fl+4x


or


(46)           j.t+fl+4x      2+n


Although this can never be binding for the historic values of x = 0.115 and

n =    0.52,   the constraint could be binding if social security were more

efficient. When x =             0.5,   the constraint is binding if gi+fl >   n.   So even low

values of i and fl could then make it necessary to constrain 8 = (z+fl)/(J2+fl+4x)

instead of allowing it to take its unconstrained maximum value.

        To summarize, there are three possible values of 8* and the corresponding

total utility values that must be examined in assessing the means—tested

program. In the first case, only myopes do not save, 8* = M/(2+n) and the

total utility is obtained by substituting this value into equation 36. In the

second case, both the myopes and the partial myopes do not save, e* =

(ii-fl)/(2+n)    and total utility is obtained by substituting the value into

equation 41. Finally, if both myopes and partial myopes do not save and 8

must be set equal to the maximum value consistent with saving by the cyclers
                                                    -32-


 9 =   (ji+fl)(i+fl+4x),   the total utility is obtained by substituting this value

 'into equation 41.

        Table 2 compares the universal and means-tested programs for a wide range

of the parameter values. The top half of the table corresponds to the

historic experience (x             0.115 and n =        0.52)   while the bottom half corresponds

to a relatively much more efficient social security program (x = 0.553 and

n =    0.52).   Calculations are presented for values of i and II ranging from 0.1

to 0.5 and for A =         0.1,   A =   0.2   and A =    0.5.
        For each set of parameter values, the table shows six things. Columns 1

and 2 show the optimal tax rate for a universal program 9u* and the resulting

level of total welfare23 (W). The same two statistics are presented for

means tested programs in columns 3 and 4. An asterisk next to the higher

utility value indicates the type of program that is optimal. Column 5

indicates for the means-tested programs whether the partial myopes save. The

final column indicates whether the tax rate in the means-tested program had to

be limited to assure that the cyclers continue to save.

       Over a wide range of parameter values, a means-tested program is

preferable to any universal program. With the historical values of social

security efficiency (x =          0.115)      and population growth (ii =    0.52),   the

universal program is optimal only for low values of A and t.                    Even when

partial myopes give even as little weight to future utility as A =                     0.2,   the

means-tested program is always optimal. But when the partial myopes weight

future utility at only A =          0.1,      their implied saving rate is so low that an

optimal means tested program would cause partial myopes to stop saving. This

is not a sufficient condition to make a universal program optimal but, if the

partial myopes are frequent enough in the population, it does become important

enough to outweigh the adverse effects of a universal program on the pure

cyclers. Thus the universal program dominates when gi =                       0.1   and II =     0.2,   or gi


= 0.1   and II =   0.5   and similarly when g.t        = 0.2   and II =    0.5.
     Two things should be noted about these three combinations. First, it

follows from the structure of the problem that if the universal program is

optimal for gi     = o.i,   fl =    0.2   and for ji   = 0.1   and fl =    0.5,   then the universal

program is also optimal for all values of U                      0.2 if gi    = 0.1.      Note also that

since the means tested program is preferable at gi                    = 0.1    and II =   0.1,    there is

some value of II between 0.1 and 0.2 at which the universal program becomes

optimal. Thus, for low enough A and ji,                 the    universal program is optimal as

long as at least a modest fraction of the population are partial myopes.

     Second, at ji       = 0.2     the universal program is not optimal at II =                  0.2    but

becomes optimal at some value of 0.2 < U <                    0.5.    When there are more myopes,

the optimal means-tested program becomes relatively more expensive and thus

keeps the universal program optimal until the distortion of saving by the

partial myopes becomes a more important problem, i.e., until U reaches a

higher level. For the same reason, when gi                    = 0.5   the mean-tested program is

optimal at fl =     0.2   and remains optimal until U                 0.


        When myopes put a higher value on future utility (A =                       0.2 and A = 0.5),

the partial myopes continue to save with the uncontrained optimal means-tested

program. Under these conditions, the means-tested program dominates the

universal program.
                                          -34-


       When social security is more efficient relative to private saving, two

 things hapen. First, under an optimal means-tested program, the partial

 myopes will in general choose to stop saving and depend on the social security

 benefits. Note that, with x =      0.553, the partial myopes do not save at any of
 the parameter combinations. Second, although the means—tested program causes

 partial myopes to stop saving, the result is a smaller welfare loss when

 social security is relatively efficient. As a result, the means-tested

 program remains preferable at moderate values of A.

       As A rises, the reduction in the saving of partial myopes caused by a

means—tested program becomes large. In addition, with a high value of A =        0.5
and with ri =    05,   it is necessary to constrain the means-tested tax rate to

avoid causing the cyclers to stop saving as well. In these cases, where

   <   8*   for the means-tested program, the universal program is optimal.

       The optimal tax rates in columns 1 and 3 show that an optimal

means—tested program is not in general smaller than an optimal universal

program.
                                                                         *
             Since the tax base is the same for both types of programs, 8m >
                                                                                 *
implies     that total taxes and therefore total benefits are higher under the

means—tested program. With the historic value of x =      0.115,   the optimal

means—tested program is larger than the corresponding universal program with

low values of A (because it is then optimal to induce the partial myopes to

stop saving) but is smaller than the universal program when A is not very low.

With a higher value of x =     0.553, the relative size of the universal and
means—tested programs depends on the values of fl and gi and no simple

generalization is possible. It cannot be said that a means-tested program is

better because it is smaller, although table 2 indicates that, whenever the
                                         —35—


universal program is preferable, it is also smaller than the corresponding

optimal means-tested program.

3.     A Concluding Comment

       The analysis of this paper shows that a means-tested social security

program may be preferable to a universal program under a wide range of

economic conditions. But the analysis also shows that the optimal type of

program and the optimal level of benefits in a universal program depend on the

of   fl and A, an increase in the relative frequency of myopes raises the optimal

tax in the means-tested program. Similarly, if the means—tested program is

optimal but causes partial myopes to stop saving, the optimal tax rate

increases with the combined frequency of myopes and partial myopes.

       This suggests that overall welfare can be increased if the working

population as a whole can be divided into two subgroups with a different type

of program provided to each group. Note that this does not require that the

subgroups be homogeneous --   all   cyclers or all myopes --   but   only that the

groups have different mixes of myopes, partial myopes and cyclers. Moreover,

although it would obviously be best to know the characteristics of each

subgroup with precision, a welfare improvement could be achieved even with

imperfect information.

      An obvious criteria for grouping individuals is income. Low income

individuals are more likely to be myopes or to be partial myopes who give low

weight to future consumption. If so, the low income group might be an

appropriate candidate for a universal program.

      All of the analysis in this paper has reflected the fact that the utility
                                         -36-


 characteristics that influence the saving behavior of each individual are

 unobservable. it is possible, however, to observe saving. An individual who

 saves, especially in the form of a pension or special retirement account, is

 certainly not a myope in the sense of this paper. The analysis presented here

 implies that any individual who demonstrates sufficient saving should be

 eligible for a means—tested program even if a universal program would be

 optimal for that individual's population subgroup.

      Finally, it should be noted that, within the population for whom a

means—tested program is optimal, there is no way to increase efficiency by

varying the program among subgroups (unless the means-tested benefits would

cause cyclers to become nonsavers). To see this, note that the optimal level

of means-tested benefits does not depend on the values of A, j.t,   or   11; the

optimal tax rate varies only because differences in .& (and in II if partial

myopes stop saving) changes the tax rate required to finance a given level of

benefits. To see this, recall that 9* = gi/(2+n) for the means-tested program

if partial myopes save (equation 37) and 9* =    (gi+fl)/(2+n) if only cyclers save
(equation 42). But benefits per retiree are bt = (M+n) 1(1+n)ew if only

cyclers save. The benefit to wage ratio is therefore always

bt/wt =   (1+n)/(2+n).   Creating separate subgroups would not cause the optimal

benefit/wage ratio to vary among subgroups. Since redistributing the tax

burden would not provide any overall welfare change, there is no gain from

disaggregation within the means—tested population.
