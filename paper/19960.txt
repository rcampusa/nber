Managing Credit Bubbles
Alberto Martin and Jaume Ventura
NBER Working Paper No. 19960
March 2014
JEL No. E32,E44,O40

                                              ABSTRACT

We study a dynamic economy where credit is limited by insufficient collateral and, as a result, investment
and output are too low. In this environment, changes in investor sentiment or market expectations
can give rise to credit bubbles, that is, expansions in credit that are backed not by expectations of future
profits (i.e. fundamental collateral), but instead by expectations of future credit (i.e. bubbly collateral).
During a credit bubble, there is more credit available for entrepreneurs: this is the crowding-in effect.
But entrepreneurs must also use some of this credit to cancel past credit: this is the crowding-out effect.
There is an "optimal" bubble size that trades off these two effects and maximizes long-run output and
consumption.

The "equilibrium" bubble size depends on investor sentiment, however, and it typically does not coincide
with the "optimal" bubble size. This provides a new rationale for macroprudential policy. A lender
of last resort can replicate the "optimal" bubble by taxing credit when the "equilibrium" bubble is too
high, and subsidizing credit when the "equilibrium" bubble is too low. This leaning-against-the-wind
policy maximizes output and consumption. Moreover, the same conditions that make this policy desirable
guarantee that a lender of last resort has the resources to implement it.

    Credit markets play an increasingly central role in modern economies. Within the OECD, for
instance, domestic credit has risen from 100% of GDP in 1970 to approximately 160% of GDP in
2012 (Figure 1). This growth masks large variations across countries and over time (Figure 2). And
yet, there is a common feature to all these di¤erent country experiences that stands out: credit
has often alternated periods of rapid growth or booms, with periods of stagnation or signi cant
decline or busts. Moreover, there is some evidence that these credit booms and busts have become
more common in recent years.1
    Consider the case of the United States, where credit has grown more or less continuously
throughout the sample period. Even there, it grew by approximately 40 percent of GDP between
1990 and 2010, only to contract sharply afterwards. In Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, the
dynamics of credit look similar during the last decades: stagnant or declining credit between the
mid 1980s and the mid 1990s, a spectacular surge in credit between the mid-1990s and 2010, and
stagnation or a sharp decline since then. Looking ahead, these drops in credit need not be short-
lived as the Japanese and Swedish experiences show. In Japan, for instance, credit grew rapidly in
the late 1990s and has fallen steadily since its 1999 peak. In Sweden, credit collapsed during the
 nancial crisis of the early 1990s and it took over a decade to return to its previous peak.
    These credit booms and busts tend to be accompanied by changes in key economic variables. It
has been well documented that credit booms are associated with high asset prices and high growth
rates of real GDP, consumption and investment. According to some estimates the growth rate of
investment doubles during booms.2 In spite of this, credit booms are still viewed with concern by
policymakers and academics. The reason is that they eventually end, and their aftermaths are often
characterized by nancial crises and low economic growth.3 This has prompted calls for policies
that restrain credit during booms, in the hope that smaller booms will lead to smaller crises.

     See Mendoza and Terrones (2012) and DellAriccia et al. (2012) for a brief discussion on the formal de nition
and empirical identi cation of credit booms. Mendoza and Terrones (2012) analyze the evolution of private credit to
the private sector in 61 countries between 1960 and 2010 and identify 70 credit booms: each of the countries plotted
in Figure 2 contains at least one of these. DellAriccia et al. (2012) analyze data on bank credit to the domestic
private sector in 170 countries between 1960 and 2010. They identify 175 credit booms, which translates into a 14%
probability of a country experiencing a credit boom in any given year. They also document that credit booms appear
to have become more common over time, in the sense that the fraction of countries experiencing a credit boom in
any given year has been increasing since the 1980s. Claessens et al. (2011) use a di¤erent approach and study credit
cycles, but they also nd them to be common: in a sample of 21 advanced economies between 1960 and 2007, they
are able to identify 114 such cycles.

     DellAriccia et al. (2012) nd that one third of credit booms end up in nancial crises. Mendoza and Terrones
(2012) nd slightly lower numbers. The recent nancial crisis in the United States also provides evidence in this
regard: it was those regions that experienced the largest credit booms in the run up to the crisis that su¤ered the
greater increase in credit delinquency during the crisis (DellAriccia et al. 2008, Mian and Su 2009).

   To evaluate the merit of these calls for policy, one must have a view of the forces driving
these credit cycles. Credit may uctuate for variety of reasons, and di¤erent types of uctuations
may call for di¤erent policy responses. At a very general level, uctuations in credit may reect
changes in demand or in supply. And these, in turn, may reect changes in a variety of factors
like preferences, technology or expectations. In this paper, we follow the large body of recent
macroeconomic research on the  nancial accelerator and focus on credit uctuations that are
driven by uctuations in borrowing constraints. The narrative is simple. When a borrower obtains
credit, she is exchanging goods today for a promise to deliver goods in the future. These promises
are only valued by lenders if they have some guarantee of being repaid. One can think of this
guarantee as the future income of borrowers that can be credibly pledged to lenders. We refer to
this pledgeable income as the economys stock of collateral. If borrowers are constrained, it is this
stock of collateral that determines the amount of promises that can be issued. If borrowers are
constrained, understanding boom-bust episodes like the ones depicted above requires a theory of
collateral uctuations. This paper provides such a theory.
   Our key innovation is to distinguish between fundamental and bubbly collateral. Fundamental
collateral is the part of a borrowers pledgeable income that corresponds to future output, i.e.
it consists of a borrowers rights to future production. Bubbly collateral is instead the part of
a borrowers pledgeable income that corresponds to bubbles or pyramid schemes, i.e. it consists
of a borrowers rights to future contributions in such schemes. The macroeconomic literature
has exclusively focused on fundamental collateral, studying its implications for credit, investment
and growth. This view of collateral is incomplete, though. Whenever fundamental collateral is
insu¢cient (say, because of weak enforcement institutions), we show that there is room for investor
optimism to sustain bubbles that expand the economys stock of collateral and total credit.
   What are the macroeconomic e¤ects of bubbly collateral? By de nition, it enables borrowers
to obtain credit in excess of their fundamental collateral: intuitively, current borrowers can obtain
excess credit today because it is expected that there will be excess credit in the future as well.
This is the crowding-in e¤ect of bubbles, which ceteris paribus increases investment. But this future
excess credit will divert some of the resources of future generations away from investment. This is
the crowding-out e¤ect of bubbles, which ceteris paribus reduces investment. The macroeconomic
consequences of bubbles depend on the relative strength of these two e¤ects. In particular, we nd
that the crowding-in e¤ect dominates when bubbly collateral is low, and the crowding-out e¤ect
dominates when bubbly collateral is high. This gives rise to an optimal bubble which trades-o¤


                                                  2
these two e¤ects and provides the amount of bubbly collateral that maximizes long-run output and
consumption.
   An essential feature of bubbly collateral is that its stock is driven by investor sentiment or
market expectations. The credit obtained by borrowers today depends on market expectations
about the credit that borrowers will obtain tomorrow, which in turn depend on tomorrows market
expectations about the credit that borrowers will obtain on the day after, and so on. Because of
this, markets may sometimes provide too much bubbly collateral and sometimes too little of it,
which creates a natural role for stabilization policies. We show that a lender of last resort with the
authority to tax and subsidize credit can in fact replicate the optimal bubble allocation. To do so,
it must adopt a policy of leaning-against-the-wind, taxing credit when bubbly collateral is excessive
and subsidizing it when bubbly collateral is scarce. We explore the implications of this policy and
show that it raises output and consumption, although it may sometimes increase macroeconomic
volatility. Moreover, the same conditions that make bubbly collateral possible guarantee that a
lender of last resort always has enough resources to implement the desired policy.
   Sections 1, 2 and 3 contain the main results of the paper. Section 1 develops our basic model of
collateral, credit and investment. Section 2 explores bubbly equilibria and studies the implications
of bubbly collateral for dynamics and welfare. Section 3 introduces a lender of last resort and
shows how credit-market interventions can be used to maximize output and consumption. Section
4 explores the issue of a scal backstop, i.e. of the resources required to sustain the desired policy.
Section 5 extends the model by introducing roles for       nancial intermediaries and various types
of credit contracts. Section 6 concludes. Before moving on, we o¤er a short review of related
literature.
   Literature review:
   The model developed here builds upon previous work by Martin and Ventura (2011, 2012). In
Martin and Ventura (2012), we analyzed the existence and macroeconomic e¤ects of bubbles in an
economy with extreme nancial frictions that impede credit. In Martin and Ventura (2011), we
extended the analysis to an economy with credit, and argued that bubbles could be a source of
collateral. Relative to those papers, we now: (i) fully characterize the e¤ects of bubbly collateral,
identifying the conditions under which it is expansionary or contractionary; (ii) analyze the e¤ects
of macroprudential policies, and of the resources required to implement them, and; (iii) generalize
the framework by introducing nancial intermediaries and di¤erent types of credit contracts.
   Our paper is obviously related to a large body of research that deals with uctuations in credit,


                                                  3
both empirically and theoretically. The former has sought to identify empirical regularities of
credit booms and busts: Gourinchas et al. (2001), Claessens et al. (2011), Mendoza and Terrones
(2012), DellAriccia et al. (2012) and Schularick and Taylor (2012) fall within this category. On
the theoretical front, various papers have tried to model credit cycles as an equilibrium outcome
of competition in nancial markets. Some examples of this work are Ruckes (2004), DellAriccia
and Marquez (2006), Matsuyama (2007), Gorton and He (2008) and Martin (2008). Like us,
these papers model uctuations in credit. Unlike us, though, these papers emphasize the role
of institutional features of nancial markets  like regulation or the incentives of certain market
participants  in generating and magnifying uctuations in credit. We take instead a macroeconomic
perspective and argue that, when fundamental collateral is scarce, investor sentiment may give rise
to credit bubbles.
   From a methodological perspective, thus, this paper is closest to the literature that has studied
the e¤ects of bubbles in the presence of nancial frictions: (i) unlike us, Caballero and Krishna-
murthy (2006), Farhi and Tirole (2011) and Miao and Wang (2011) focus on the role of bubbles
as a useful source of liquidity; (ii) like us, Kocherlakota (2009) focuses on the role of bubbles as
collateral or net worth; and (iii) unlike us, Ventura (2011) focuses on the e¤ects of bubbles on the
cost of capital. There is also a long tradition of papers that view at money as a bubble, like
Samuelson (1958) and Kiyotaki and Moore (2008). Our model is also related to the vast work
on macroeconomic models with nancial frictions, going back to Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and
Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), in which collateral plays an key role in determining the level of nancial
intermediation and economic activity. Our contribution relative to this work is that we distinguish
between fundamental and bubbly collateral.
   Our study of policy is related to the literature on bailouts. Bailouts are commonly rationalized
as a way to stimulate economic activity in the event of a crisis, by transferring resources towards
distressed agents. In a macroeconomic model with nancial frictions, for instance, Gertler and
Kiyotaki (2012) show how policies that provide credit to distressed agents can reduce the severity
of a crisis. At the same time, the prevailing view is that bailouts generate costs ex ante by distorting
incentives (e.g. Farhi and Tirole 2012). The credit subsidies that we study are not really bailouts
because they are nanced through taxes on borrowers themselves, i.e., they entail no net transfers
to borrowers as a whole. They are akin to bailouts, though, because they are given to borrowers
to repay their debts. The e¤ects of these subsidies are di¤erent from those emphasized in the
literature, however. They have positive e¤ects on economic activity ex ante because, as in Ranciere


                                                   4
et al. (2008), the expectation of future bailouts raises collateral; but they are costly to execute ex
post because they divert resources away from investment.
    Finally, this paper is related to the recent work that stresses the role of information insensitive
collateral such as Dang et al. (2011) and Gorton and Ordoñez (2012). This research emphasizes
the role of the nancial system in generating collateral that is accepted by everyone without fear of
adverse selection, because it does not pay for any agent to produce private information regarding
its underlying characteristics. Of course, these incentives may change during a crisis, in which case
information is generated and the value of collateral might experience large swings. In our model,
it is also natural to think of bubbly collateral as information insensitive relative to fundamental
collateral. The value of bubbly collateral depends on investor sentiment or market expectations
which are public information. The value of fundamental collateral depends instead on the regular
business activity of the underlying rm or nancial institution, which is likely to be inuenced
by managers through a variety of channels that are di¢cult to observe and give rise to private
information.


1     The bubbly economy

The starting point of our analysis is the classic Diamond (1965) model of capital accumulation with
overlapping generations. The young supply labor, consume part of their labor income and save the
rest. These savings are used to purchase capital from the old and to produce new capital. The old
own the capital, demand labor and consume their capital income.
    Tirole (1985) extended the Diamond model by introducing an additional market for bubbles
or pyramid schemes. Participants in a pyramid scheme make voluntary contributions that entitle
them to receive the next contribution. Thus, we say that an individual purchases a bubble when
he/she makes a contribution to a pyramid scheme. Similarly, we say that an individual sells a bubble
when he/she receives a contribution from the pyramid scheme. Starting a bubble or pyramid scheme
yields a windfall to the rst participant, which consists of the rst contribution to the scheme. We
assume that each generation starts new bubbles with random initial value. These new bubbles are
traded in the market for bubbles alongside the old bubbles started by previous generations.4
    The model we present here adds a credit market to the Tirole model, as sketched in the last

   4
     The arrival of new bubbles is an important departure from the original Tirole model that plays a key role in our
theory.

section of Martin and Ventura (2012). In the Diamond and Tirole models there is only intergen-
erational trade. Here we create gains from intragenerational trade by introducing heterogeneity
within generations. Workers/lenders supply labor, but they do not own capital and bubbles. En-
trepreneurs/borrowers are the ones who own capital and bubbles. This creates a role for a credit
market in which young workers/lenders give credit to young entrepreneurs/borrowers. In return,
old entrepreneurs/borrowers pay a (possibly contingent) interest rate to old workers/lenders.
       Our emphasis is precisely on the workings of this credit market. If this market worked well,
the equilibria of our model would not di¤er from those of the Tirole model. The credit mar-
ket would simply allow workers/lenders to e¤ectively own capital and bubbles, since competition
among entrepreneurs/borrowers would ensure that equilibrium credit contracts replicate the payo¤s
of owning capital and bubbles. But, like the  nancial accelerator literature, we recognize that
imperfect enforcement institutions limit the collateral of entrepreneurs/borrowers and impair the
workings of the credit market.5 By collateral, we mean the old-age resources that young entrepre-
neurs/borrowers can pledge to young workers/lenders. In this section, we describe our model and
show how the set of equilibria depends on the availability of collateral.
       Before moving on, it might be useful to write a few words about the nature of bubbles for those
readers that remain skeptical about this modeling strategy. Even though the concept of bubble
might seem quite abstract or exotic to some at rst sight, it is easy to nd real-world situations
that correspond fairly well to this concept. Consider, for instance, credit given to a rm in excess of
the net present value of the cash-ows that this rm will generate. Such excessive credit is rational
if lenders expect the rm to obtain excessive credit also in the future. Thus, giving excessive credit
is akin to purchasing a bubble, that is, it can be interpreted as a voluntary contribution to the rm
that gives the right to the next voluntary contribution. This leads us to think of real-world rms
as portfolios of capital and bubbles. And this is exactly what the entrepreneurs/borrowers in our
model stand for. Naturally, the young workers/lenders in our model stand for those savers that
rationally provide credit to them.

   5
    Imperfect enforcement institutions do not impair the workings of the markets for labor, capital or bubbles since
transactions in these markets do not involve a promise by the seller to deliver future payments to the buyer. Thus,
labor, capital and bubbles can be traded even in situations in which credit is not possible or severely restricted.

1.1     The basic setup

Consider an economy inhabited by a sequence of equal-sized and overlapping generations of young
and old. Time starts in period t = 0 and then goes on forever. The objective of individual i of
generation t is to maximize his/her utility Uti , given by:


                                       Uti = Ct;t
                                              i
                                                  +           i
                                                         Et Ct;t+1                                (1)


where               i and C i
          > 0; and Ct;t    t;t+1 are the young-age and old-age consumptions of individual i
                                                                 i  0 and C i
generation t. Naturally, consumption must be non-negative, i.e. Ct;t        t;t+1  0. As usual,

Et fg denotes the mathematical expectation of the corresponding variable.
   Each generation consists of two types of individuals. Individuals of the rst type work during
youth, save part of their labor income and lend it to nance old age consumption. We refer to
individuals of this type as workers/lenders. Individuals of the second type borrow during youth to
 nance purchases of capital and bubbles, and they produce during old age. We refer to individuals
of this type as entrepreneurs/borrowers.
   Workers/lenders supply one unit of labor during youth and decide how much of their labor
income to save. They use their savings to purchase credit contracts in exchange for a gross, possibly
contingent, interest rate of Rt+1 units of output in period t + 1 for each unit of output used to
purchase credit contracts in period t. We refer to Rt+1 as the contingent or ex post interest rate,
and we refer to Et Rt+1 as the interest rate. In old age, these individuals receive the return to their
savings and consume. Thus, the consumptions of these individuals are given by:

                                             i
                                            Ct;t = Wt      Lt                                      (2)

                                            i
                                           Ct;t+1 = Rt+1  Lt                                      (3)

where Wt is the wage and Lt is savings or the value of credit contracts purchased. Equation (2)
says that young-age consumption equals labor income minus savings, while Equation (3) says that
old-age consumption equals the return to savings. Worker/lenders maximize utility in Equation
(1) subject to the budget constraints in Equation (2) and (3).
   Entrepreneurs/borrowers invest and produce. The production technology can be described by




                                                   7
the following Cobb-Douglas function:

                                                                 t
                                                                            1
                                     F (Kt ; Nt ) = At  Kt          Nt                                     (4)


where Kt is capital,       2 (0; 1) and     > 1. Labor productivity grows at the constant rate               1.
We refer to At as a productivity shock and assume that it uctuates randomly over time. The
production of one unit of capital requires one unit of the consumption good. We assume that
capital fully depreciates in production.
        Entrepreneurs/borrowers also initiate and trade bubbles. We use Bt to denote the value of the
bubbles in period t. Some of these bubbles are old since they were initiated by previous generations
of entrepreneurs/borrowers and were purchased by entrepreneurs/borrowers of generation t                       1.
Some of these bubbles are new since they are initiated by entrepreneurs/borrowers of generation
t       1. Thus, the aggregate bubble evolves as follows:

                                                  B           N
                                          Bt+1 = Rt+1  Bt + Bt+1                                             (5)


       B is the increase in price or return to the bubbles purchased from entrepreneurs/borrowers
where Rt+1
of generation t               N the value of the bubbles initiated by the entrepreneurs/borrowers
                      1; and Bt+1
                              N as bubble creation and we assume that it is non-negative, i.e.
of generation t. We refer to Bt+1
 N  0.
Bt+1
        To   nance their activities, entrepreneurs/borrowers sell credit contracts to workers/lenders.
These contracts must be collateralized, that is, they must be backed by credible promises of fu-
ture payments. This brings us to the key friction that underlies all the analysis of this paper:
imperfect enforcement institutions limit the amount of available collateral. In particular, entrepre-
neurs/borrowers can hide a fraction 1          of their capital income from enforcement institutions, so
that:

Equation (6) states that promised payments cannot exceed a fraction  2 [0; 1] of their capital
income plus their bubbles. We think of the rst term as the fundamental collateral of entrepre-
neurs/borrowers, and of the second term as their bubbly collateral.6 Throughout the paper, we

    6
   One way to think about this constraint is that courts can grab all the consumption goods that are traded in the
market but only a fraction  of those that are not traded.



                                                        8
refer to Equation (6) as the credit or collateral constraint. As  ! 1, the entire capital income can
be used as collateral for credit and the credit constraint coincides with the restriction that old-age
                                   i
consumption be non-negative, i.e. Ct;t+1  0. We refer to this limiting case as the frictionless
economy.
   With these assumptions, we can write the consumptions of entrepreneurs/borrowers as follows:

                                          i
                                         Ct;t = Lt        Kt+1     Bt                             (7)

                        i
                       Ct;t+1 = F (Kt+1 ; Nt+1 )     Wt+1  Nt+1 + Bt+1   Rt+1  Lt               (8)

Equation (7) says that young-age consumption equals credit minus investment and the purchases
bubbles, while Equation (8) says that old-age consumption equals production net of labor costs plus
the value of bubbles minus credit payments. Entrepreneurs/borrowers maximize utility in Equation
(1) subject to the budget constraints in Equations (7), (8), the credit constraint in Equation (6)
and the law of motion of bubbles in Equation (5).


1.2     Markets and prices

We are ready to solve the model. In the labor market, old entrepreneurs/borrowers (henceforth,
borrowers) demand the labor supplied by young workers/lenders (henceforth, lenders) until the
marginal product equals the wage. Since the latter supply one unit of labor, Nt = 1, this means
that:
                                          wt = (1         )  At  kt                             (9)

As usual, we use lowercase letters to refer to variables in units of e¢cient workers so that, for
instance, kt      t    Kt . Equation (9) says that labor income is a constant fraction 1          of
production.
   In the market for bubbles, old borrowers sell bubbles to young ones. Old borrowers supply
all their bubbles provided the price is nonnegative. Young borrowers, as we have seen, nance the
purchase bubbles by selling credit contracts. If the expected return to holding bubbles falls short of
the interest rate, therefore, young borrowers make a loss when they sell credit contracts to nance
bubble purchases and the demand for bubbles is zero. If the expected return to holding bubbles
exceeds the interest rate, young borrowers make a pro t when they borrow to purchase bubbles
and the demand for bubbles is unbounded. Thus, equilibrium requires that the expected return to


                                                      9
holding bubbles equals the interest rate:

                                                     B
                                                 Et Rt+1 = Et Rt+1                                               (10)


       Finally, we move to the credit market where young lenders supply credit to young borrowers.
Note rst that           Et At+1 kt+11  Et Rt+1     1
                                                           in equilibrium.7 Using this observation, the supply
of credit by young lenders can be described as follows:
                                          8
                                          < = wt      if         Et Rt+1 > 1
                                       lt                                       .                                (11)
                                          : 2 [0; w ] if         Et Rt+1 = 1
                                                   t


If the interest rate exceeds the discount rate, young lenders save all their income. If the interest
rate equals the discount rate, young lenders are indi¤erent between saving and consuming.
       The demand for credit by young borrowers can be written as follows:
                          8
                          >
                          <    At+1  kt+11               if Et bN
                                                                  t+1  (1      )     Et At+1  kt+1
                 Rt+1   =                                                                                        (12)
                          >    At+1  kt+1 + bt+1       if Et bN
                          :              1l                      t+1 < (1      )     Et At+1  kt+1
                                             t


Since there are no restrictions on the type of contracts that can be written, we have that, if the credit
constraint is binding in one state, it is always binding. Thus, the contingent interest rate is either
the marginal product of capital or the maximum that the constraint allows in all states. Whether
the credit constraint is binding or not depends on whether expected bubble creation exceeds the
capital income that is not pledgeable. If it does, then the credit constraint is not binding. If it does
not, the credit constraint is binding.
       To complete the solution, we need to determine how borrowers use the credit they receive, and
this is as follows:                         8
                                            < = lt      if          Et At+1  kt+11 > 1
                                 kt+1 + bt                                                                      (13)
                                            : 2 [0; l ] if
                                                     t              Et At+1  kt+11 = 1

Equation (13) says that borrowers consume in the rst period only if the marginal product of capital
             1
equals           . Otherwise, borrowers use all the credit they receive to invest and purchase bubbles.

   7
    This can be shown by contradiction. Assume rst that Et Rt+1 >  Et At+1  kt+1    1
                                                                                         . Then, entrepreneurs would

                                                                   ; while savers would like to spend all their income
purchasing credit contracts. Thus, it follows that  Et At+1  kt+11
                                                                       Et Rt+1 . Assume next that 1 > Et Rt+1 .
Then, savers would not want to purchase credit contracts and  Et At+1  kt+1    1
                                                                                    = 1 > 1 ; while entrepreneurs
would want to sell as many credit contracts as allowed by their constraint. Thus, it follows that Et Rt+1  1 .

1.3   Equilibrium dynamics

To obtain some intuitions about the workings of the model, it is useful to collapse the previous
equations as follows:

                             8   1                 bt
                             < =

                                                                                                 (14)
                             : 2 0;

                            bt+1 =                     bt + nt+1  At+1  kt+1                   (16)

where ut+1 is the unexpected component of bubble returns and nt+1 is the value of new bubbles

                                                                bN
                                                                 t+1
as a share of output, i.e. ut+1  Rt+1  Et Rt+1  and nt+1               . We refer to ut and nt
                                                             At+1  kt+1
as bubble-return and bubble-creation shocks, respectively. Equations (14) and (15) describe the
supply and demand of funds for investment, respectively. Equation (16) describes the dynamics
of the bubble. Jointly, Equations (14)-(16) provide a full description of the dynamics of the state
variables, i.e. kt and bt ; for any admissible sequence of productivity and bubble shocks, i.e. At , ut
and nt . Thus, we refer to them as the law of motion of the system.
   Figure 3 shows how the interest rate and next periods capital stock are determined by solving
Equations (14) and (15). If the capital stock is low, the interest rate is above the discount rate and
young lenders use all their income to purchase credit contracts. In this case, collateral is abundant
and the capital stock is determined by the supply of funds. We label this range of capital stocks the
region of full intermediation. If the capital stock is high, the interest rate equals the discount rate
and young lenders consume part of their income. In this case, collateral is scarce and the capital
stock is determined by the demand for funds. We label this range of capital stocks the region of
partial intermediation.
   Figure 4 shows how productivity and bubbles a¤ect the supply and demand of funds for in-
vestment and, thus, the law of motion. High realized productivity raises the supply of funds, while
high expected productivity raises collateral and the demand for funds. Bubble return shocks are
embedded in the size of the bubble. The higher is the size of the bubble the lower is the supply of
funds. High realized bubble creation raises the size of the bubble and lowers the supply of funds,
but high expected bubble creation raises collateral and the demand for funds. These intuitions are
crucial to understand the results that follow.


                                                  11
        To construct equilibria for this economy, we propose rst a joint stochastic process for bubble
return and creation shocks: fut ; nt g for all t. Naturally, this bubble process must be such that
Et ut+1 = 0, bt  0 and nt  0 for all t. We adopt the convention that b                    1   = 0 and set n0 to
ensure that b0 takes the desired starting value. With this stochastic process at hand, we search for
a non-negative sequence for the state variables fkt ; bt g for all t that satis es Equations (14)-(16).
If such a sequence exists, we say that the proposed bubble process is an equilibrium. If such a
sequence does not exist, we say that the proposed bubble process is not an equilibrium.
        The bubbleless equilibrium is that one in which the bubble process takes this form: fut ; nt g =
f0; 0g for all t. The bubbleless equilibrium always exists and it is a useful reference. But there are
additional bubbly equilibria and these we nd more interesting.


2        Bubbly equilibria

Borrowers wish to purchase bubbles if these grow at least as fast as the interest rate. Borrowers
can raise enough funds to purchase bubbles if these do not grow faster than the economy. Thus,
bubbly equilibria are possible if and only if the interest rate does not exceed the growth rate.
        It is well known that this situation arises if the frictionless economy is dynamically ine¢cient.
In this case, the interest rate is low because the supply of funds is high and the economy overinvests.
Bubbles reduce unproductive investment and this allows the economy to sustain a higher level of
consumption and welfare. We do not want to focus on this case however.8
        It is somewhat less known that, even if the frictionless economy is dynamically e¢cient, the
interest rate might fall below the growth rate if nancial frictions limit the stock of fundamental
collateral. In this case, the interest rate is low because the demand for funds is low and, if anything,
there might be underinvestment. This is indeed the case we focus on here.
        Throughout, we assume that            > 1. This condition ensures that individuals are patient
enough to save even if the interest rate is below the growth rate. Without this condition, the
interest rate would never fall short of the growth rate and bubbly equilibria would not be possible
in our model.

    8
    One reason is that dynamic ine¢ciency is believed to be rare in practice (see Abel et al. 1988), although this
has been recently challenged by Geerolf (2012). Another reason is that, in this case bubbly equilibria are associated
with declines in investment and output, which seems counterfactual.




                                                         12
2.1   Bubbly business cycles

It seems natural to start with the case in which there are no productivity shocks, i.e. At = A. We
also adopt the following assumption:
                                                 1                 1
                                                   <          <                                          (17)
                                                 2                1+

The rst inequality ensures that the frictionless economy is dynamically e¢cient and investment is
always productive. Thus, bubbly equilibria exist only if the demand for funds is depressed. The
second inequality ensures that this is indeed the case. That is, collateral is scarce and this lowers
the demand for funds enough to make bubbly equilibria possible.
   The existence of bubbly equilibria of this sort does not imply that there is underinvestment in
the bubbleless equilibrium. If
                                                 1                       1

the steady state of the bubbleless equilibrium lies in the region of full intermediation. The interest
rate is low enough to make bubbly equilibria possible, but not low enough to lead to underinvest-
ment. If
                                              1                    1

the steady state of the bubbleless equilibrium lies in the region of partial intermediation. In this
case, the interest rate is low enough not only to make bubbly equilibria possible, but also to lead
to underinvestment.
   Let us consider rst a quiet bubble process: fut ; nt g = f0; ng for all t. This deterministic
bubble is an equilibrium if n is low enough. From any initial condition, the economy converges to
the following steady state:
                                                                                                    

Equation (18) and (19) jointly determine the steady state values for the capital stock and bubble.
One can think of n as an index of the size of the bubble. A higher value of n leads to a higher
steady state bubble, for at least two reasons. The rst and direct one is that a higher value of
n raises the value of new bubbles that are created in each period. The second and more indirect
reason is that a higher value of n raises the interest rate, thereby raising the rate at which the value

                                                          13
of old bubbles grows.
   Figure 5 shows the e¤ects of n on the steady state values of capital, the bubble, credit, the
interest rate and utility. By utility we mean the sum of utilities of lenders and borrowers, i.e.
Ut = i Uti . The left panels of the gure show the case in which the steady state of the bubbleless
      P

equilibrium is located in the region of full intermediation. The e¤ects of the size of the bubble on
the capital stock and utility are negative over all the range of possible values of n. The reason is
that investment is not distorted in the bubbleless equilibrium. Since the supply of funds is vertical,
bubbles raise the interest rate and displace productive investment. This crowding-out e¤ect of
bubbles lowers the capital stock and welfare.
   The right panels of Figure 5 show instead a case in which the steady state of the bubbleless
equilibrium is located in the region of partial intermediation. The e¤ects of the size of the bubble on
the capital stock and utility have an inverse U-shape. The reason is that there is underinvestment
in the bubbleless equilibrium. Since the supply of funds is initially at, small bubbles do not a¤ect
the interest rate but they provide additional collateral that raises credit and investment. This
crowding-in e¤ect of bubbles raises the capital stock and welfare.
   But if the bubbles are too large, the economy enters the region of full intermediation and the
e¤ects of bubbles change. Since the supply of funds becomes vertical, large bubbles raise the interest
rate and displace productive investment. The crowding-out e¤ect returns. The larger the bubble
the larger is this crowding out e¤ect. Indeed, if the bubble is large enough, utility is lower than if
there is underinvestment.
   There is therefore an optimal bubble that provides the amount of collateral that maximizes the
capital stock and utility in the steady state. This bubble is the one that places the economy at the
frontier of the partial and full intermediation regions, eliminating underinvestment without raising
the interest rate. A smaller bubble would provide too little collateral and the funds available for
investment would be too low. A larger bubble would raise the interest rate and the funds available
for investment would also be too low.
   The quiet bubble provides the basic intuition for what is to come later. But, to the extent
that uctuations in credit are driven by bubbles, these bubbles are everything but quiet. Thus, we
consider next an economy that experiences bubbly episodes. In particular, we assume that the
economy starts in the fundamental state where bt = nt = 0. The economy can transition to one of
many bubbly states which we index by j = 1; :::; J. Let "j be the probability of reaching bubbly
state j from the fundamental state. When the economy abandons a bubbly state, it returns to the

fundamental state. Let  j be the probability that the economy reaches the fundamental state from
bubbly state j. We refer to the interval that goes from the rst period the economy reaches bubbly
state j to the rst period in which it returns to the fundamental state as a bubbly episode of type
j. Let zt be the state of the economy, i.e. zt 2 fF; B1 ; :::; BJ g. During a bubbly episode of type

The assumption that bubble creation is constant is just for convenience. The assumption about
bubble returns says that, during a bubbly episode, the expected return to holding the bubble equals
that of credit contracts. Conditional on the bubbly episode not ending, the return on the bubble
will exceed that of credit contracts. But this is only compensation for the risk of the bubbly episode
ending and the bubble bursting.9
       With these assumptions, the dynamics of the economy can be written as follows:

in each period depends on whether investment is determined by the supply or demand for funds.
It is worth mentioning that the probability of a bubbly episode starting raises the demand for
funds in the fundamental state. Thus, the behavior of the economy in the fundamental state is
not equivalent to that of the bubbleless equilibrium.10 Equation (22) describes the evolution of the
bubble during an episode of type j. Note that the growth of the bubble depends on how large and

   9
     Naturally, the economy with the quiet bubble analyzed in Figure 3 is the limiting case of the economy with
bubbly episodes in which there is a bubbly state with "j ! 1,  j ! 0 and nj = n. The economy enters this state
at the beginning of time with probability one and never leaves it.
  10
     We have assumed that the probability and type of bubbly episodes are constant over time and therefore expected
bubble creation is constant when the economy is in the fundamental state, i.e. "  n. This assumption is not necessary.
We could have assumed instead that there are uctuations in expected bubble creation in the fundamental state. In
this case, even in the fundamental state the economy would be subject to changes in investor sentiment.



                                                                   15
risky it is, i.e. nj and  j . The larger and riskier, the faster it grows.
   To understand the behavior of this economy, we show next some simulations. To produce them,
we follow three steps. First, we choose parameter values that ensure that the steady state of the
                                                                                      1
bubbleless equilibrium is located in the region of partial intermediation, i.e. <        . Second,
                                                                                  1+ 
we create four bubbly states that di¤er in terms of the size of the bubble and its risk:



                                     SizenRisk      safe          risky
                                        small     (nS ;  S )   (nS ;  R )
                                        large     (nL ;  S )   (nL ;  R )

where nS < nL and  S <  R . We also assume that all these bubbles are equally likely, i.e. "j = ".
Third, we generate a sequence of 10,000 values for zt , and start the economy in the steady state so
that we record 10,000 periods of steady state behavior.
   Figure 6 plots the simulated time series of kt , Et Rt+1 , lt , Ut and bt during a window of 200
periods. The Figure also shows the mean and standard deviation of these variables computed with
the entire series of 10,000 periods. Given the length of the simulation, these sample statistics are
excellent approximations to their corresponding theoretical counterparts.
   Figure 6 illustrates that, depending on their characteristics, some bubbles crowd-in capital while
others crowd-out capital. Take the rst bubble in the sample: in this case, the bubble is small (i.e.,
n = nL ) and safe (i.e.,  =  S ) and it raises the economys capital stock. The interest rate remains
                 1
constant at          throughout the episode, which con rms that there is not enough bubbly collateral
to fully intermediate wages. Contrast these e¤ects with those of the next two bubbles, which are
large (i.e., they both have n = nL ). Initially, both bubbles raise the economys capital stock: after
a while, though, they both become too large and reduce capital accumulation. The interest rises
          1
above         during both episodes, con rming that there is too much bubbly collateral. The gure
also illustrates that riskier bubbles grow faster because they must compensate potential buyers
for their risk of bursting. To see this, compare the two episodes around periods 8030 and 8040.
Both bubbles are of the same size but the rst is riskier: thus, even though the rst episode lasts
less than the second one, the maximum size of the bubble is larger. One implication of this is
that, conditional on not bursting, riskier bubbles become larger and have more severe crowding-out
e¤ects.
   These examples illustrate two key aspects of credit bubbles. The rst one is that they have


                                                    16
mixed e¤ects on the economy. Bubble creation provides collateral to the current generation and this
allows it to raise credit and expand investment. But bubble creation also requires future generations
to cancel this additional credit and this diverts some of their resources away from investment. In
this regard, we can think of the crowding-out e¤ect of bubbles as an overhang e¤ect, in the sense
that growth is hurt by bubbles that were created in the past. The second point is that credit
bubbles can follow very di¤erent paths, potentially much more complicated than the ones explored
here, and they may have very di¤erent e¤ects on output and welfare. This naturally suggests a
role for policy in selecting or replicating a desirable equilibrium. Before going there, though, we
need to deal with another layer of complexity: real-world economies are not only subject to bubble
shocks but also to fundamental ones.


2.2   Bubbly and real business cycles

Let us bring back productivity shocks. In particular, assume that At can take two positive values:
At 2 fAL ; AH g with AL  AH . The transition probability is   0:5, i.e. P rob (At+1 6= At ) = .
We de ne EAL  Et fAt+1 =At = AL g and EAH  Et fAt+1 =At = AH g, and note that AL 
EAL  EAH < AH . Then, we adopt the following assumption:

                                      AH                  AL
                                            <     <                                             (23)
                                   AH + EAH           AL +   EAL

This assumption converges to that in Equation (17) as productivity shocks become small. The rst
inequality ensures that the frictionless economy is dynamically e¢cient and, as a result, investment
is always productive. The second inequality ensures that nancial frictions are strong enough to
make bubbly equilibria possible.
   Consider rst the bubbleless equilibrium with productivity shocks. The economy goes through
periods of high and low productivity. Periods of high productivity are characterized a large supply
of funds and by a high expected productivity, which raises the demand for funds. The former lowers
the interest rate while the later increases it (see Figure 4). The relative strength of these e¤ects
depends on the persistence of productivity as measured by , and the importance of diminishing
returns to investment as measured by     . If  > 0:5  , the e¤ect of productivity on the supply
of funds dominates. In this case, when productivity is high the interest rate is low and the gap
between the actual and the optimal levels of investment is high. If instead  < 0:5  , the e¤ect of
productivity on the demand for funds dominates and the opposite is true.


                                                 17
    To illustrate how productivity a¤ects the optimal bubble, we extend the economy with bubbly
episodes to introduce productivity shocks. To simplify, we assume that transition probabilities
for productivity and bubble shocks are independent. With these assumptions, we have that the
dynamics of the economy are now given by:

Equations (24) and (25) are simple generalizations of Equations (21) and (22) to allow for produc-
tivity uctuations.
    Figure 7 shows simulations for this economy. As before, the simulations start in the steady
state and run for 10,000 periods. To produce them, we use the same methodology as in the previous
section, except that we now have a process for productivity. In choosing the parameters for this
process, we have assumed that  > 0:5  . As mentioned, this parameter condition implies that
the bubble that fully intermediates wages grows with productivity.
    This is why in Figure 7 bubbles raise the capital stock when productivity is high but reduce
it when productivity is low. This is best exempli ed by the long episode that starts after period
6960 and lasts until after period 7000, in which the bubble is large (i.e., n = nL ) and safe (i.e.,
 =  S ). The capital stock increases during the episode but it uctuates with productivity. When
productivity is high, the capital stock grows because wages are high and the large bubble channels
part of these wages to investment. When productivity falls, however, the capital stocks contracts
for two reasons: not only are wages lower, but the large bubble diverts part of them away from
                                                                                                                                 1
investment. The evolution of the interest rate con rms this narrative since, by rising above
whenever productivity is low, it indicates that there is too much bubbly collateral and investment
is being crowded out. In this example, the equilibrium bubble is too small when productivity is
high but it is too large when productivity is small: an optimal bubble would thus be procyclical,
amplifying the response of output to productivity shocks.11

   11
      More generally, the cyclicality of the bubble that attains full intermediation depends on the shock that is con-
sidered. We have also explored, for instance, a speci cation of the model with nancial shocks, i.e. with random
uctuations in . These shocks a¤ect the demand for funds but not their supply and, as a result, collateral is pro-


                                                               18
    The general insight of this example is that the relative strength of crowding-in and crowding-out
e¤ects changes with the strength of fundamentals. The same amount of bubble creation today, for
instance, may have small or large crowding-out e¤ects in the future depending on the evolution of
productivity. If future productivity is high and the economy is in the region of partial intermedia-
tion, the crowding-out e¤ect of current bubble creation will be small. If instead future productivity
is low and the economy is in the region of full intermediation, the crowding-out e¤ect of current
bubble creation will be high. In the terminology of the previous section, bubbly episodes may have
large overhang e¤ects should the economy su¤er from a fall in productivity.
    Taken together, the examples of the last two sections show that bubbles may expand the econ-
omy by providing collateral, but they may also lower investment and output if they grow too large.
Can public policy be used to provide the economy with the desired amount of bubbly collateral?
We show next that the answer to this question is a¢rmative.


3     A lender of last resort

We introduce next an agency that manages bubbly collateral through credit-market interventions.
Subsidizing old borrowers, this agency expands their collateral. Taxing old borrowers, this agency
reduces their collateral. The scal implications of these interventions are borne by young borrowers.
Although these interventions do not directly a¤ect the equilibrium value of the bubble, they enable
the agency to select an equilibrium allocation.
    We refer to this agency as a lender of last resort (LORL), since it guarantees the collateral of
borrowers at the targeted level. If ex-post the bubble turns out to be too small given the target,
the LOLR provides additional resources to them. If ex-post the bubble turns out to be too large
given the target, the LOLR takes away resources from them.


3.1    The model with a lender of last resort

We introduce a LOLR that intervenes in credit markets. In particular, it promises borrowers in
period t a transfer of St units of the economys consumption good. The transfer St can be negative
and contingent on the state of the economy. If the transfer is positive, its cost is nanced by young
borrowers. If the transfer is negative, its bene t is distributed to young borrowers. Letting Xt

cyclical. This means that, to intermediate wages fully, a bubble must be counter-cyclical with respect to , so that
it reduces the response of output to nancial shocks.

                                     St+1 =               St + St+1                            (28)


The formal similarity between Equations (28) and (5) describing the dynamics of policy and the
bubble hints at some of the results that follow.
   The introduction of a LOLR does not a¤ect the problem of lenders, but it does a¤ect the
problem of borrowers. Since borrowers can use subsidies to cancel credit contracts, the collateral
constraint in Equation (6) now becomes


                   Rt+1  Lt    [F (Kt+1 ; Nt+1 )      Wt+1  Nt+1 ] + Bt+1 + St+1 ,         (29)


while their consumptions are now given by

                                      i
                                     Ct;t = Lt     Kt+1       Bt    Xt                          (30)

The only di¤erences between Equations (30)-(31) and Equations (7)-(8) are due to the transfers
that are made by the LOLR. Borrowers maximize utility in Equation (1) subject to the budget
constraints in Equations (30), (31), the credit constraint in Equation (29) and the laws of motion
of bubbles and policy in Equations (5) and (28).

                                                    20
   The introduction of a LOLR does not a¤ect the equilibrium in the markets for labor or bubbles,
which are still respectively described by Equations (9) and (10). It does a¤ect the equilibrium
in the credit market, though. While the supply of credit is still described by Equation (11), the
demand of funds for investment by young borrowers can be written as follows:

                                                                     
                                                           t+1 + st+1 < (1          )     Et At+1  kt+1

            :
                                                                                                              (32)
As before, Equation (32) says that the credit constraint either binds in all or in none of the states.
Thus, the contingent interest rate is either the marginal product of capital or the maximum that
the constraint allows in all states. The only novelty is that the constraint is a¤ected by the LOLRs
policies: future subsidies st+1 provide collateral to borrowers and they raise the demand for credit
and thus investment, but current taxes st divert the resources of borrowers and they reduce the
share of credit that can be used for investment.
   To complete the solution, we need to determine how borrowers use the credit they receive, and
this is as follows:
                                           8
                                           < = lt      if         Et At+1  kt+11 > 1

                                           : 2 [0; l ] if

Equation (33) says that borrowers consume in the rst period only if the marginal product of capital
           1
equals         . Otherwise, borrowers use all the credit they receive to invest, purchase bubbles, and
pay taxes.


3.2      Equilibrium dynamics

We can now collapse the model with a LOLR into the following four equations:

                                                                                         sNt+1

We shall think of mt as the key policy instrument in the model, which is determined by the LOLR.
   Equations (34) and (35) respectively describe the supply and demand of funds for investment
with policy. Equation (36) and Equation (37) respectively describe the evolution bubbles and
subsidies. Equations (34)-(37) provide a full description of the dynamics of the state variables, i.e.
kt , bt and st ; for any admissible sequence of productivity and bubble shocks, i.e. At , ut and nt and
for any sequence of policy interventions mt . Thus, we refer to these four equations as the law of
motion of the system with policy.
   Equations (34)-(37) show how policy shocks a¤ect the supply and demand of funds for invest-
ment and thus the law of motion. Like bubble shocks, past and present policy choices as captured
by m0 ; m1 ; :::; mt are embedded in subsidies st . Through taxation, these policy choices reduce the
present supply of funds available for investment as depicted in Equation (34). Simply put, young
borrowers must devote part of their credit to paying for the subsidies promised to the previous
generation. Future policy choices as captured by mt+1 instead raise the collateral of borrowers, as
shown by Equation (35), enabling them to expand their demand for funds and their investment.
   Once a LOLR is introduced into the model, an equilibrium cannot be de ned without specifying
policy. Throughout, we take policy as given and describe it by a stochastic process fmt g. We adopt
the convention that s    1   = 0 so that s0 is determined by m0 . We then propose a joint stochastic
process for bubble return and bubble creation shocks: fut ; nt g, with Et ut+1 = 0, bt  0 and nt  0
for all t. With this process at hand, we search for a sequence for the state variables (kt ; bt ; st ) that
satis es kt  0 as well as Equations (34)-(37). If such a sequence exists, we say that the proposed
stochastic process is an equilibrium. If such a sequence does not exist, we say that the proposed
stochastic process is not an equilibrium.


3.3    Managing collateral during business cycles

What can a LOLR achieve by taxing and subsidizing credit? A                     rst important result, which
follows directly from comparing Equations (34)-(37) with Equations (14)-(16), is that a LOLR can
use policy to replicate any of the equilibria of the original economy. Consider, for instance, that
the economy is characterized by a process fut ; nt g for the bubble return and creation shocks and


                                                      22
a corresponding bubble bt . The LOLR can replicate the equilibrium allocation that would arise
under an alternative process f^    ^ t g ; and the corresponding bubble ^bt , by choosing a policy fmt g
                              ut ; n
that satis es
                                          ^t  ^bt
                                          u          1    u t  bt   1
                         mt  At  kt =                                  + (^
                                                                            nt     nt )  At  kt      (38)

for all t > 0: This policy guarantees that st + bt = ^bt and that Et f(mt+1 + nt+1 )  At+1 g =
    nt+1  At+1 g in all periods. Thus, the total crowding-out and crowding-in e¤ects of the pol-
Et f^
icy st together with bubble bt are identical to those of bubble ^bt in the absence of policy.
   This result is important because we have seen that markets may provide too little bubbly
collateral, which is insu¢cient to intermediate all wages, or too much of it, which crowds out
investment and reduces output and consumption. It therefore seems natural to consider policies
that manage the economys collateral. In particular, we consider policies fmt g that satisfy

                                                 1      1
                       Et fmt+1  At+1 g =            kt+1      Et f(         + nt+1 )  At+1 g ,   (39)

                                    kt+1 =                                                             (40)

in all periods t. Equation (39) guarantees that the proposed policy stabilizes Et Rt+1 and sets
                1
it equal to         at all times. Equation (40) says that this stabilization must be achieved while
guaranteeing that wages are fully intermediated in equilibrium. Through this policy, the LOLR
                                                                                                          1
e¤ectively leans against the wind, taxing credit when collateral is excessive and Et Rt+1 >
and subsidizing it when collateral is scarce and there is partial intermediation. Note that the policy
depends only on observables, since it need only be contingent on aggregate productivity At and on
the bubble shocks fut ; nt g.
   We can illustrate the e¤ects of such a policy by revisiting the example of a quiet bubbly
process, in which At = A and fut ; nt g = f0; ng for all t. We have already argued that there is an
optimal level of bubble creation in this example, which maximizes output and welfare in the steady
state. This bubble, which places the economy at the frontier of the partial and full intermediation
regions, corresponds exactly to the one prescribed by our policy rule. Thus, if we use n to denote
such an optimal level of bubble creation and follow Equation (38), a policy that sets m = n             n
in all periods attains the maximum levels of output and welfare.
   Figure 8 depicts the steady state values of capital, credit, the interest rate, utility, the bubble
and the subsidy s as a function of n, both with and without policy. The solid lines depict the



                                                          23
equilibrium values of these variables without policy. The gure is drawn for an economy with par-
tial intermediation in which n has non-monotonic e¤ects. The dashed lines reect the steady-state
values of these same variables under the proposed policy rule. In this case, all variables are inde-
pendent of n. Once again, the reason is that the LOLR intervenes in the credit market to maximize
intermediation while minimizing crowding out e¤ects. In the region of partial intermediation it
does so by subsidizing credit payments by old borrowers, i.e. by setting s > 0, whereas in the
region of full intermediation it does so by taxing credit payments by old borrowers, i.e. by setting
                         1
s < 0 until Et Rt+1 =        .
   These insights are easily extended to the economy with bubbly episodes that was analyzed
in Section 2.1. This is the same economy as before, with the only di¤erence that it transitions
between fundamental and bubbly states according to a sunspot variable zt 2 fF; Bg. Thus, the
optimal bubble is also the same as before, and the corresponding allocation can be implemented
by the LOLR by setting

                                                                       u t  bt   1
                                 mt  At  kt = (n   nt )  At  kt                  ,


in all periods. Figure 9 shows the e¤ects of this policy on the main variables of the economy,
and it also depicts the size and risk of the bubble that characterize each bubbly episode. Once
again, the solid lines represent these variables in the absence of policy while the dashed lines rep-
resent their values under the policy rule. The LOLRs intervention, which is now state contingent,
raises the capital stock in all periods and fully stabilizes it. Whenever bubbly collateral is scarce
and the economy is in the partial intermediation region, credit is subsidized until it equals total
                                                                                          1
wages. Whenever collateral is abundant and the interest rate exceeds                          , credit is taxed until the
             1
Et Rt+1 =        .
   This example illustrates that the LOLRs intervention only a¤ects the market for bubbles
through its e¤ect on the interest rate. The economy still experiences bubbly episodes and the
policy rule has no direct e¤ect over them. Instead, the LOLR monitors these uctuations and
intervenes in the market for credit accordingly. When bubbles burst, the LOLR steps in and helps
borrowers cancel their credit contracts. When bubbles become too large, as in the second and
third episodes of the example, the LOLR steps in and taxes borrowers. By doing so, the LOLR
reduces the demand for credit, eliminates the crowding out e¤ect and boosts capital accumulation.
Of course, not everyone is happy with this policy: generations with a lot of bubble creation lose



                                                      24
because part of their wealth is taxed away. Yet, as the table in Figure 9 con rms, average welfare
increases as a result of the intervention.
      Figures 8 and 9 depict the e¤ect of our policy rule in economies with no fundamental uncertainty.
In this case, the rule is optimal in the sense of maximizing average welfare and output in the steady
state. The analysis becomes more complicated in economies with fundamental uncertainty, though.
As we have discussed, a level of bubble creation that boosts growth when productivity is high might
lead to large crowding-out e¤ects when productivity falls. This complicates the characterization
of an optimal bubble. Nonetheless, we apply next our same policy rule to this economy and show
that it also raises the average levels of output and welfare in the steady state.
      Figure 10 builds on the example of Section 2.3 and depicts the impact of the policy rule in
an economy with both, productivity and bubble shocks. As before, the solid lines represent the
values of the di¤erent variables in the absence of policy while the dashed lines represent their values
under the policy rule. The gure shows that, once more, the policy rule stabilizes the interest rate
and it also raises the average capital stock and welfare. The new insight is that the policy has
an ambiguous e¤ect on economic volatility. Fluctuations that are driven by bubble shocks are
stabilized by the policy, while uctuations that are driven by productivity shocks are ampli ed by
it.
      The reason for this last result is that, under our assumptions, the policy rule is procyclical
relative to productivity shocks. When productivity is high, investment is constrained by the demand
of funds. Wages are high in these periods and collateral is insu¢cient to intermediate them all.
By following the policy, the LOLR increases expected subsidies, raises credit and exacerbates the
boom. When productivity is low, however, investment is constrained by the supply of funds. In
these times, there is not much that the policy can do to expand output besides taxing borrowing
to reduce crowding-out e¤ects. Hence, the policy rule increases the strength of productivity-driven
booms relative to productivity-driven recessions. Its overall e¤ect on economic volatility, however,
depends on the relative variance of bubble vis-à-vis productivity shocks. In our particular example,
as the table in Figure 10 shows, it increases the volatility of both the capital stock and of welfare.
      The examples of this section show that the bubbly economy provides a new rationale for macro-
prudential policy. A leaning-against-the-wind policy that taxes/subsidizes credit when the equi-
librium bubble is too high/low can replicate the optimal bubble and maximize output and
consumption. A natural question is whether the LOLR can a¤ord this policy.

4         The scal backstop

We have assumed so far that the LOLR can guarantee any amount of collateral provided that it
does not exceed savings. In other words, we have assumed that the economys entire savings serve
as scal backstop. This is obviously an unrealistic assumption. What happens if the LOLR has
limited taxation power? We show next that the same conditions that make a policy desirable also
guarantee that a lender of last resort has enough resources to implement it.


4.1        The model with debt

We address this question by assuming that the LOLR has a taxation capacity  , i.e. a maximum
amount that it can tax per e¤ective worker. Clearly, this capacity constraint does not bind for
policies that satisfy st <  in all periods. To sustain policies that require transfers st >  in some
periods, though, the LOLR needs to issue credit contracts. To distinguish these contracts from
those issued by entrepreneurs/lenders we refer to them as public credit contracts or public debt.
We then refer to credit contracts issued by entrepreneurs/lenders as private credit contracts. Public
                                                                     G units of output in period t+1
credit contracts pay a gross, possibly contingent, interest rate of Rt+1
                                                                        G as the contingent or
for each unit of output used to purchase them in period t. We refer to Rt+1
                                                            G as the interest rate on public credit.
ex-post interest rate on public credit, and we refer to Et Rt+1
With this notation, we can write the budget constraint of the LOLR as follows:


                                           St + RtG  Dt    1   = Xt + Dt .                                       (41)


where Dt is the value of public credit contracts issued in period t. Equation (41) says that total
spending by the LOLR in transfers and debt payments cannot exceed total revenues from taxation
and the sales of public credit contracts.
         The main change relative to our previous analysis is that now we have an additional market for
public credit contracts. In this market, the LOLR supplies debt inelastically. Lender maximization
implies that, in equilibrium, the return to public credit contracts must equal the return to private

policy and the bubble hints at some of the results that follow.

     A comparison between Equations (46)-(47) and (34)-(35) shows that the introduction of debt
does not substantially a¤ect the supply and demand of funds for investment. As long as s0t = st + dt
in all periods, any policy with subsidies s0t that is fully nanced through taxation can be perfectly
replicated with an alternative policy with subsidies st < s0t that is nanced partly through taxation
and partly through debt. Equations (46) and (47) also show that, like bubbles and subsidies, the
introduction of debt nancing has conicting e¤ects on intermediation and capital accumulation.
All else equals, debt issued in the past requires taxation and it reduces the supply of funds available
for investment. This is why dt enters with a negative sign in Equation (46). Debt issued in the
present, though, makes it possible to reduce taxes on the current generation of borrowers thereby
enabling them to expand their demand for credit. This is why mG
                                                              t+1 enters with a positive sign in

Equation (47).
        Now policy consists of a sequence for the triplet xt ; mSt ; mG
                                                         
                                                                      t . We adopt the convention that

s   1   = d   1   = 0 so that s0 and d0 is determined by x0; mS0 and mD
                                                                      0 . We then propose a joint

stochastic process for bubble return and bubble creation shocks: fut ; nt g, with Et ut+1 = 0, bt  0
and nt  0 for all t. With this process at hand, we search for a sequence for the state variables
(kt ; bt ; st ; dt ) that satis es kt  0 as well as Equations (46)-(50). If such a sequence exists, we say
that the proposed stochastic process is an equilibrium. If such a sequence does not exist, we say
that the proposed stochastic process is not an equilibrium.


4.3       Are there limits to debt nancing?

A quick analysis of Equations (46)-(50) suggests that debt nancing can help achieve policies that
would not be feasible otherwise due to the scal constraint that xt   . What ensures, though, that
the government can issue public debt contracts? That is, what are the limits to debt nancing?
This question seems relevant because an important di¤erence between taxes and debt is that paying
the former is mandatory while purchasing the latter is voluntary. In any period t, the debt issued
by the LOLR is backed by taxes but also by the expectation of new debt that will be issued in
period t + 1. If this expectation changes, so might the willingness of lenders to hold debt. Thus,
debt nancing seems subject to changes in investor sentiment that might limit the LOLRs ability


                                                       28
to manage the economys collateral. In a sense, public credit might be just as bubbly as private
credit.
   To see whether this concern is justi ed, we focus on the case in which the LOLR uses the
                                                                                                   1
policy rule derived in Section 3.3 to intermediate all wages while setting Et Rt+1 =                   for all t.
We assume that  is small, so that debt nancing is is required to fund the desired subsidies. In
equilibrium, the most that the LOLR can promise to repay at time t + 1 is given by


                                Et dt+1   +                Et fEt+1 dt+2 g ,


i.e. expected debt payments cannot exceed the expected resources obtained through taxation and
through the issue of new debt. But the expected debt payments that the LOLR can make at time
t + 2 are themselves limited by expected taxation and the sale of new debt at t + 3. Taking this
into account, we can write


                     Et dt+1   +        Et f +              Et+1 f + Et+2 dt+3 gg .


Iterating this process forward we obtain an upper bound for debt payments:

                                         1
                                         X
                         Et dt+1            (  )j + lim (  )T  Et dt+T .                              (51)
                                                             T !1
                                         j=0



Equation (51) provides an expression for the LOLRs scal backstop. It says that expected debt
payments are backed by fundamental resources, which correspond to the net present value of taxes,
and by bubbly resources, which correspond to the public debt that is expected to be rolled over
forever. The key aspect of this expression is that, since               > 1, the fundamental resources of the
LOLR are in nite for any positive value of  , regardless of how small it is. Thus, even if the LOLR
must issue debt to nance its policies, it can always do so without being exposed to roll-over crises:
the reason is that, no matter how large debt payments are, they are always fully backed by future
taxes. In the bubbly economy, the scal backstop of the LOLR is unlimited!
   The intuition behind this result is quite natural. The LOLRs scal backstop includes all future
taxes, including those that will be paid by generations that are yet to be born. These tax revenues
grow with the economy. When collateral is scarce and output is below potential, though, this
growth rate is higher than the market interest rate and the net present value of tax revenues is



                                                        29
unbounded. Thus, the same condition that makes bubbly episodes possible guarantee that, even if
the LOLR must issue debt to nance its policies, this debt is not prone to a rollover crisis because
it is fully backed by tax revenues.
    Admittedly, this result has been derived in a highly stylized setting. In particular, two key
assumptions underlie the analysis. First, we have assumed that the LOLR can fully pledge its
future tax revenues for debt payments, i.e. it has full commitment. Second, we have assumed
that the LOLR can transform each unit of taxation into one unit of debt payment or subsidies,
i.e. there are no ine¢ciencies associated to tax collection and expenditure. Although important,
these assumptions are not as restrictive as they may seem. The presence of either commitment
problems or ine¢ciencies would certainly a¤ect the policy chosen by a LOLR, making it impossible
to replicate the optimal bubble. Because both of these problems reduce the e¤ectiveness of taxes
and subsidies in managing the stock of collateral, they reduce the extent of the desired intervention
in credit markets. But it is not di¢cult to show that, even in such an environment, the main insight
of this section remains valid: as long as the LOLR nds it optimal to intervene, it always has the
necessary scal backstop to nance the desired intervention.


5    On the size and type of bubbles

Up to this point, we have considered situations where the size of the bubble matters because it
determines the collateral available to issue credit contracts. We have shown that this provides a
rationale for macroprudential policy. A LOLR can improve on market outcomes by guaranteeing
credit when bubbly collateral is scarce and by taxing credit when bubbly collateral is excessive.
    But there are also situations in which it is not just the amount of bubbly collateral, but also its
type that matters. To illustrate this, we develop two simple extensions of the model. In the rst
one, we introduce nancial intermediaries that sell deposits contracts to lenders and purchase loan
contracts form borrowers. In this case, the economy needs di¤erent types of bubbly collateral to
back deposit and loan contracts. In the second extension, we introduce a set of risk-averse lenders.
In this case, the economy needs di¤erent types of collateral to back safe and risky credit contracts.
In these extensions, there is sometimes too much collateral of one type but too little collateral of
the other type. Thus, to improve on market outcomes, the LOLR must simultaneously subsidize
some types of credit while taxing others.




                                                  30
5.1   Deposit vs. loan bubbles

We introduce now a third type of individual, the intermediary, that has the same preferences as
the other two types. Now borrowers and lenders cannot trade directly. Instead, their trade must
go be done through intermediaries. Just as borrowers are the subset of individuals that have access
to the production technology, one can think of intermediaries as the subset of individuals that have
access to a screening or monitoring technology that is necessary to ensure that credit is pro table
to all parties. To simplify the discussion, we assume that there are no productivity shocks, i.e.
At = 1, ; and that there is no fundamental collateral, i.e.  = 0.
   The bubbly economy now contains two distinct credit markets. In the market for deposits,
                                                         D
intermediaries sell credit contracts to lenders: we use Rt+1 to denote the gross, possibly state
contingent interest rate paid by intermediaries on this credit. In the market for loans, intermediaries
                                                  L
purchase credit contracts from borrowers: we use Rt+1 to denote the gross interest rate paid by
                                                                           D , as the deposit rate,
borrowers on these loans. We refer to the expected return on deposits, Et Rt+1
                                         L , as the loan rate.
and to the expected return on loans, Et Rt+1
   Now we have two types of credit bubbles, which we refer to as deposit and loan bubbles.
Borrowers initiate and trade loan bubbles, while intermediaries initiate and trade deposit bubbles.
Let BtD and BtL denote the value of deposit and loan bubbles in period t. Some of these bubbles
are old and some of them are new. Thus, the aggregate bubbles evolve as follows:

       BD and RBL are the returns to deposit and loan bubbles purchased from generation t
where Rt+1                                                                                           1;
               t+1
     N D and B N L the value of the bubbles initiated generation t. We refer to B N D and B N L

   Just like borrowers loan contracts, deposit contracts must be collateralized. Since we have
assumed that there is no fundamental collateral, this means that:

                                           D           D

where Dt and Lt are the value of deposit and loan contracts, respectively.
   With these assumptions, we can solve the optimization problem of all individuals and compute
the equilibria in the labor, deposit, loan, and bubble markets. The analysis mirrors the one of
Section 1, but it su¢ces to note that

for deposit and loan bubbles could not clear.

       t+1 ; ut+1 ; nt+1 ; nt+1 are the bubble-return and the bubble-creation shocks of deposit and

loan bubbles. Equations (58)-(62) generalize Equations (14)-(16), and they provide a full description
of the dynamics of the economy in the presence of deposit and loan bubbles.
   The key innovation relative to our baseline model is that now it is both, the amount and the
distribution of bubbly collateral that matter for investment. Equation (58) shows that regardless
of their type, bubbles divert resources and crowd out investment. But whether loan and deposit
bubbles have crowding-in e¤ects depends on which collateral constraint binds, if any. Equation
(59) represents intermediaries demand for credit. If intermediaries have enough collateral, the
deposit rate equals the loan rate. Otherwise intermediaries are constrained and the deposit rate
is lower than the loan rate. Equation (60) represents borrowers demand for credit. If borrowers


                                                  32
have enough collateral, the loan rate equals the return to investment. Otherwise borrowers are
constrained and the loan rate is lower than the return to investment.
   Thus, there are two reasons why the bubbly economy may nd itself in the region of partial
intermediation: (i) because intermediaries do not have the collateral to raise all wages through
deposits; or (ii) because borrowers do not have enough collateral to raise all deposits through
loans. In the rst case, deposit bubble creation (Et nD
                                                     t+1 > 0) is expansionary because it raises the

collateral of intermediaries and thus total deposits. Loan bubble creation (Et nL
                                                                                t+1 > 0), however, is

contractionary because its only e¤ect is to raise the loan rate. There is too little deposit collateral
and too much loan collateral, so that the right policy requires subsidizing deposits while taxing
loans.    In the second case, the opposite is true. There is too little loan collateral, and the right
policy requires subsidizing loans.


5.2      Safe vs. risky bubbles

We now extend the basic model to allow for risk-averse individuals. In particular, we assume that
a fraction  of the lenders have the following preferences:


                                      Uti = Ct;t
                                             i
                                                 +            i
                                                       mint Ct;t+1                               (63)


where the operator mint fg indicates the lowest bound of the support of the corresponding variable.
To simplify the discussion, we assume that there are no productivity shocks, i.e. At = 1; and that
there is no fundamental collateral, i.e.  = 0.
   The presence of risk-averse individuals induces borrowers to issue two types of credit contracts,
                     S
safe and risky. Let Rt+1      R respectively denote the ex-post interest rates on these contracts.
                         and Rt+1
Naturally, safe contracts promise a noncontingent interest rate but risky contracts do not. It follows
that now borrowers face two credit constraints:

                                      R
                                     Rt+1  LR    S      S
                                             t + Rt+1  Lt  Bt+1                                 (64)

                                         S
                                        Rt+1  LSt  mint Bt+1                                    (65)

Since we have assumed that  = 0, there is only bubbly collateral in this economy. Equation
(64) says that the total payments promised to lenders cannot exceed the total amount of collateral.
Equation (65) says that the amount of safe payments that are promised cannot exceed the minimum


                                                     33
value of collateral. Otherwise, these payments would need to be state contingent and could not be
riskless. Thus, while all collateral in this economy is bubbly, it comes in two types. The stock of
safe collateral is given by mint Bt+1 , while the stock of risky collateral is given by Bt+1   mint Bt+1 .
    If there is enough safe collateral to ensure that the credit constraint in Equation (65) is not
binding, all the results are the same as in the baseline model. Basically, all credit is priced in a
risk-neutral fashion: risk-averse lenders purchase only safe credit and all risky credit is in the hands
of risk-neutral lenders. But if there is not enough safe collateral, a new and interesting situation
can arise. Because risk-averse lenders do not want to purchase risky credit, there may be full
intermediation of risk-neutral savings but partial intermediation of risk-averse savings. In such a
situation, the law of motion of the economy is given by:

                                                                   1            bt
                            kt+1 =      mint bt+1 + (1     )         kt                          (66)


                                       R       Et nt+1  kt+1 mint bt+1
                                   Et Rt+1 =                                                         (67)
                                                  kt+1       mint bt+1
                                               R +u
                                           Et Rt+1  t+1
                                  bt+1 =                    bt + nt+1  kt+1                        (68)

Equation (66) says that investment equals total savings minus the bubble: the di¤erence with the
basic model is that only risk neutral lenders save their entire income, while risk-averse lenders do
not because there is not enough safe collateral. Thus, this economy has too much risky collateral
and too little safe collateral.
    It is straightforward to show that increases in mint nt+1 are expansionary since they raise savings
and crowd-in capital, while increases in Et nt+1          mint nt+1 are contractionary since they reduce
funds available for investment and crowd-out capital. In this example, the right policy would
expand one bubble at the expense of the other. In terms of the notation used in section 3, the
LOLR would set a negative value for Et mt         mint mt+1 , but a positive value for mint mt+1 .


6    What have we learned?

So what do we take home from this paper? Credit booms and busts are a fact of life in modern
economies. There is a widespread view among macroeconomists that uctuations in collateral are
an important driver of these uctuations in credit. This paper builds on this view and makes the
following observations:


                                                    34
  1. Economies with binding borrowing constraints have two types of collateral, fundamental
        and bubbly. Fluctuations in both types of collateral generate boom-bust cycles in credit,
        investment and growth. These uctuations might be driven by traditional or fundamental
        shocks, but also by changes in investor sentiment or market expectations. Both types of
        shock a¤ect the amounts of fundamental and bubbly collateral.

  2. Bubbly collateral raises equilibrium credit (crowding-in) but diverts part of this credit
        away from investment (crowding-out). When bubbles are small, the crowding-in e¤ect
        dominates and investment and output increase. When bubbles are large, the crowding out
        e¤ect dominates and investment and output are low. There is therefore an optimal bubble
        size that trades o¤ these two e¤ects to maximize long-term output and consumption.

  3. Markets are generically unable to provide the optimal amount of bubbly collateral, but a
        lender of last resort can replicate the optimal bubble allocation by taxing credit when
        bubbly collateral is excessive and subsidizing it when it is insu¢cient. Such a policy can
        be characterized as leaning-against-the-wind, but not as a policy of preventing bubbles. It
        cannot be characterized as a bailout policy either, since the credit-market interventions that
        are required to implement it pay for themselves.

   These results provide a coherent and rich view of credit booms and busts, in which both funda-
mental and bubbly collateral play a key role. They also provide a useful blueprint to guide policy
in dealing with credit bubbles. But the theory has limitations and there is still much work to be
done.
   A rst important limitation is that the model assumes perfect information, so that everyone
observes the gap between the optimal bubble and the existing one: the role of policy is simply to
bridge this gap. Reality is more complicated because market participants and policymakers may be
uncertain as to whether uctuations are driven by fundamental or bubbly collateral. Introducing
this type of uncertainty is an important next step in this research agenda.
   A second limitation of the theory is that it essentially takes fundamental collateral as exogenous.
One may think, though, that fundamental collateral is produced by the nancial system when
it invests in the screening and monitoring of borrowers. Bubbly collateral provides an inexpensive
alternative to fundamental collateral because it is sustained by market expectations. This may
entail costs, however: by discouraging investment in fundamental collateral, bubbly collateral may
be expansionary in the short run at the expense of larger downturns when bubbly episodes end.

                                                  35
Taking into account these negative incentive e¤ects of bubbles, and analyzing how they impact the
design of policy, is another exciting next step in this research agenda.
