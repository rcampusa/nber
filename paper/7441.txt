Indian Manufacturing Industry: Elephant or Tiger? New
Evidence on the Asian Miracle

                                               ABSTRACT


        We estimate the rate of total factor productivity growth in Indian manufacturing industry for the
period 1973-1992, and compare the results to those obtained by Young for the East Asian Tigers. We
then interpret our results in light of Krugman’s hypothesis that, because the Asian Miracle was driven by
capital formation under diminishing marginal returns, it is not sustainable. We suggest a reinterpretation of
the sustainability problem that recognizes the true role of TFP as a motive force in output growth. Past
studies have compared the TFP residual to the growth rate of output and used this ratio as a measure of
the importance of TFP as a source of growth. We argue that this is an erroneous way of assessing the role
of TFP, because it ignores the additional capital formationmade possible by an increase in productivity and
therefore understates productivity’s true importance. Our estimates suggest that the understatement may
be quite large, and that one might better ask if the growth rate of TFP, rather than capital growth, is
sustainable.
