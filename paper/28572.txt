Unequal Jury Representation and Its Consequences

JEL No. J15,K4

                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze the extent and consequences of unequal representation on juries in Harris County,
Texas. We first document that residents from predominantly white and high-income
neighborhoods are substantially over-represented on juries. Using quasi-random variation in those
called for jury duty each day, we next establish that Black defendants are more likely to be
convicted and receive longer sentences from juries with more residents from these over-
represented neighborhoods. We estimate that equal representation would reduce Black
defendants' median sentence length by 50 percent and the probability of receiving a life sentence
by 67 percent. Straightforward remedies could mitigate this severe bias.

1. Introduction
         Following the English legal tradition, the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers is a
bedrock of American criminal law. While the legal definition of peers varies somewhat across
jurisdictions, juries are generally expected to reflect a fair cross-section of the community in
the district in which a court convenes.1 Yet, in practice, juries across the United States are often
highly unrepresentative of their communities ­ especially with respect to the young, poor,
transient, and racial minority populations ­ as a result of a sequence of selection processes that
determine who ultimately sits on the jury. Legal scholars highlight that this under-
representation begins with the decision of who is eligible for jury service and included in a
jurisdiction's `master list' (15, 22). Second, it has been demonstrated in multiple jurisdictions
that unequal response (or non-response) rates to jury summons across these sub-populations
severely exacerbates the unrepresentativeness of the jury pool (8, 12, 19). Finally, researchers
have shown that attorney biases exist during the pre-trial jury selection process (5, 11, 10, 18).
These patterns have been seen in a wide range of settings, including state and federal courts:
researchers studying federal courts concluded that "some amount of underrepresentation in jury
pools is the norm" (23).
         An almost completely disjoint body of research, conducted by criminologists,
psychologists, and economists, studies the effects of specific jury characteristics (as opposed to
community representation more generally) on trial outcomes. The earliest studies provide
correlational evidence in the real-world of a relationship between jury race and trial outcomes
(7, 9) or causal evidence in laboratory mock-jury settings (see 24, 25 and more recently, 6).
Using quasi-experimental research designs, which take into account the non-random nature of
the seated jury, economists provided the first causal evidence that a jury's race (1, 13), age (2),
gender (3, 16), political affiliation (4) and experiences (21) affect trial outcomes in the real
world.
         Taking these two literatures together, the unrepresentativeness of juries raises serious
doubts about the fundamental fairness of the jury trial system under the current practices of
many American jurisdictions. The goal of this paper is to bring together in a single study, for
the first time in the literature, analyses of both jury representation and its causal effect on trial
outcomes, allowing us to assess the consequences of jury representation for the fair and
impartial application of the law. To do so, we have assembled detailed jury and trial data for a

                                                                                                                   1
large jurisdiction, Harris County, Texas, which includes the city of Houston and has a
population of about 4.7 million.
      Our analysis proceeds in three main parts. The results of each are striking and statistically
robust. We first document how well each neighborhood in the study area is represented in pre-
trial jury panels and seated juries. An important contribution of our paper is that we measure
representation based on juror micro-geography (zip codes), opening new possibilities for
remedying unequal representation. Jury representation from zip codes within Harris County
varies widely, with some zip codes having as little as 30 percent, and many over 200 percent,
of their expected share of seated jurors. Representation is highly correlated with zip code
characteristics. Residents of predominantly white and high-income neighborhoods are
substantially over-represented on seated juries, while those from predominantly Black,
Hispanic, and low-income neighborhoods are under-represented, sometimes severely so.
Importantly, the vast majority of the variation in representation on seated juries is already
reflected in the pool of potential jurors, with jury selection in the pre-trial voir dire process
playing a comparatively small role.
      We next estimate the causal impact of jurors from each neighborhood on trial outcomes
using a research design that isolates quasi-random day-to-day variation in the composition of
potential jurors. Most notably, Black defendants are much more likely to be convicted, receive
more severe jury-determined sentences, and are much more likely to receive life sentences when
eligible, if they (randomly) draw jury pools with a relatively high share of potential jurors from
over- versus under-represented neighborhoods. Further analysis suggests that the effect of jury
neighborhood is most strongly associated with the neighborhood's racial composition, as
opposed to a variety of other socioeconomic and demographic factors.
      Finally, we combine the first two parts of our analysis and use the causal estimates of the
impact of jury neighborhood composition on trial outcomes to simulate the distribution of
conviction rates and sentence lengths if juries were instead representative of the entire
community in Harris County. The results imply that the unequal representation of existing juries
increases mean and median sentence lengths for Black defendants by over 50 percent and more
than triples the likelihood that eligible Black defendants receive life sentences. Thus, taken as
a whole, the results of our study imply that unequal jury representation in Harris County results
in severe racial bias in the application of the law.
      Our analysis naturally suggests an immediate set of potential policy remedies that would
mitigate this bias as well as a basic test for representativeness by micro-geography that, along



                                                                                                 2
with an appropriate remedy, would make jury trials fundamentally fairer in any jurisdiction that
implemented them. We discuss these possibilities in the conclusion.


2. Jury Trials: Harris County, Texas
         The process of choosing jurors for a trial begins with the master jury list: in Harris County
this consists of those individuals in the county who are registered to vote or hold a Texas
driver's license or identification card.2 Citizens on the list are randomly selected and mailed a
summons to report for jury service on a given date. If summoned individuals do not meet
eligibility requirements (e.g. age 18, citizen, literate, no prior felonies) or have grounds for an
exemption (e.g. older than 70, primary caretaker, attending school), they do not need to appear
in court. Historically, only about one-third of summoned jurors in Harris County show up for
jury duty (14). Eligible individuals who show up for jury duty are randomly assigned to a panel
of roughly 65 individuals, which forms the jury pool for a particular trial.
         Members of the jury pool then go through the voir dire process to determine who is seated
on the jury (12 members plus 1-4 alternates). Potential jurors can be removed for cause if there
is a known reason they cannot be impartial. Prosecutors and defense attorneys can also use
peremptory challenges (10 each for a felony trial) to strike potential jurors without providing a
reason; though it is illegal for strikes to be based solely on race or gender, this is difficult to
enforce in practice. Thus, while the jury pool is randomly assigned to cases from the set of
individuals who report for jury duty, the voir dire process implies the seated jury may be
correlated with case and defendant characteristics.
         Texas is one of six states that allow juries to sentence defendants in non-capital cases.
Before seeing the jury pool, the defendant must decide whether they want a trial by jury and
who will do the sentencing upon conviction (judge or jury). The same jury decides both
convictions and sanctions (27).


3. Data
The Harris County court clerk provided us with two data sets ­ a defendant data set and a jury
data set ­ for all felony trials (about 2,400) from June 2005 through March 2012. The former
includes defendant demographic characteristics (name, race, birth date, gender, zip code of
residence), current offense and criminal history characteristics, and verdict and sentencing
outcomes. We organized the data at the defendant-case level, so that a defendant with multiple

                                                                                                    3
charges that went to the same jury was coded as one observation. The juror demographic data
set has the following information for about 300,000 potential jurors that were empaneled for a
jury trial (i.e., all who received a summons and showed up at the courthouse): case number,
panel identification number, panel status (i.e., on the seated jury, struck, or dismissed), the
juror's position in the panel, gender, birth date, and zip code of residence, as well as the date
and time they were assigned to the panel, and the date and time they were released from the
panel.3 Using the juror's zip code, we merged 2010 census data on the juror's neighborhood,
including the racial composition, median income, population size, high school graduation rate,
share with income below poverty, and share foreign born. The descriptive analysis of juror and
defendant representation in Section 4 utilizes these two raw data sets.
       The analyses of the causal effects of representation on trial outcomes, presented in
Sections 5-7, necessitates matching the defendant and jury data sets. The matching procedure
(see supplementary appendix), along with the restriction of only examining cases in which the
jury will make both the conviction and sentencing decisions, results in a sample of 981 non-
capital felony trials, which are matched to jury pools and seated juries.4 In 75% of these trials,
the defendant is eligible for a life sentence, which in Harris County is technically a sentence of
99 years in prison. As described in the Texas statutes, minimum sentences for these cases
depend on the defendant's criminal history and can be as low as five years (e.g. if convicted of
a 1st degree felony with no history).5 Our analysis in Sections 5-7 focuses on the 734 life
sentence-eligible cases, because this set of cases constitutes the majority of our sample and
allows juries the most discretion in their sentencing decisions. We include results for the full
set of non-capital felony trials in the appendix.


4. Geographic Representation in the Jury Pool, Seated Jury, and Defendant Population
       This section measures the extent to which individuals from various neighborhoods (zip
codes) are over- or under-represented in two populations at the core of the criminal justice
system: the jury pool that decides the outcome of cases and the defendants subject to these
decisions. We calculate jury and defendant representation ratios for the sample of 299,945 jury

  Not all jury pools that were empaneled for a trial actually tried a case. Sometimes the case they were empaneled
for was delayed and the entire panel was dismissed.

  As explained in the appendix, our ability to match the jury data with the defendant data was limited by the fact
(highlighted by the court clerk) that the case number attached to a jury panel was sometimes wrong. We only
included those cases in which we were confident on the quality of the match. Appendix Table ST1 demonstrates
the relative comparability of the matched and unmatched cases; the only exception is that the matched sample has
more female defendant and murder cases, which we tried more aggressively to match.

pool members and 1,754 defendants (with observable zip code information) from 129 Harris
County zip codes. Equation (1) demonstrates how the jury pool ratio is calculated. Specifically,
for each zip code z (of the Z Harris County zip codes), we calculate the ratio between the share
of all individuals in the pooled sample of jury pools (N=299,945) from zip code z and the share
of the population (over age 16) in the census from zip code z. This ratio will be greater (less)
than one for zip codes that are over (under)-represented in the jury pool relative to the census.
We follow the same procedure to create representation ratios for defendants and seated jurors
(as opposed to the pool from which the jury is chosen).6

The introduction of this novel measure of representation based on micro-geography (zip codes)
is an important contribution of our paper. Examining whether certain neighborhoods are
systematically over- or under-represented on juries not only provides a direct and easily
implementable test of whether juries reflect a fair cross-section of the community as required
by the law, but also naturally suggests straightforward remedies designed to equalize
representation across neighborhoods.
          Our analysis of jury and defendant representation reveals four key results. First, many zip
codes have jury pool representation ratios far from one. (See Supplementary Appendix Figure
SF1.) In fact, 25% of zip codes have jury pool representation ratios less than 0.61 and 25% have
ratios greater than 1.39. Panel 1A of Figure 1 plots these ratios in a map of Harris County zip
codes, revealing that the over-represented zip codes (shaded darker) are in the outskirts or
suburbs.
          Second, the wide dispersion in jury representation ratios originates in the jury pool itself
and not the process through which the seated jury is selected. This result implies that remedies
designed to ensure fair representation must focus not only on the voir dire process used to select
jurors but, importantly, on the system used to develop the jury pool. (See Figure SF2).
          Third, certain zip codes are severely over- and under-represented amongst the defendant
population as well, but in the opposite direction. In particular, Panel 1B of Figure 1 shows that


6
 Though the raw data indicate whether the potential juror was seated, Harris County informed us of measurement
error in this variable. As described in the appendix, we have confirmed using time stamps of juror release that the
vast majority of seated jury flags are correct but indeed there are some errors.


                                                                                                                 5
the same zip codes that are under-represented in the jury pool are over-represented amongst
defendants and vice versa.
      Fourth, perhaps unsurprisingly given these geographical differences, zip code
representation in the jury pool is closely related to other zip code characteristics. Panels 1C and
1D of Figure 1 highlight the differential racial composition of these zip codes. It is clear from
visual inspection that the most represented zip codes in the jury pool also have the highest
proportion of white residents, while those most represented amongst defendants have the
highest fraction of Black residents. Table 1 demonstrates how stark this contrast is (e.g., on
average, 25.0% and 12.6% of the population is Black in the under- and over-represented zip
codes, respectively) and that race is not the only dimension in which these neighborhoods differ.
Under-represented areas have twice as many Hispanic residents, 50% lower median income,
three times as many residents in poverty, higher unemployment rates, lower educational
attainment, and more foreign-born residents than over-represented neighborhoods.


5. The Causal Effect of Unequal Representation on Trial Outcomes
      We now turn to investigating the impact of jury pool representation on trial outcomes
using the matched jury pool-defendant data. Summary statistics for the sample of life sentence-
eligible cases are shown in Appendix Table ST2. About 59%, 26% and 14% of defendants are
classified as Black, Hispanic, and white respectively; just 6% of defendants are female. The
distribution of charges is heavily skewed towards serious violent offenses (28% and 24% of
cases include a murder and robbery charge respectively) and sex offenses (19% of cases),
consistent with this being a life-sentence eligible sample. We consider two main trial outcomes.
The first is whether a defendant is convicted of a life sentence (versus either an acquittal or a
sentence of less than 99 years); about 15% of our sample is convicted of a life sentence. The
second outcome considered is the sentence length (in years) the jury assigns, where we code
acquittals as a sentence of zero years. Using this measure, the average sentence length in our
sample is almost 39 years.
      Our research design is motivated by the quasi-random way in which jury pools are
assigned to trials. Specifically, the approximately 65 individuals who constitute the jury pool
for a given trial are randomly assigned to a trial after having been randomly called for jury duty
on a given day. The only aspect of the process that is not completely random is the choice of
individual jurors to show up for jury duty. These choices would only create a problem for our
analysis if they were somehow systematically correlated with case and defendant
characteristics. Tables ST3 and ST4 present empirical evidence that jury pools are effectively


                                                                                                 6
randomly assigned by regressing jury pool characteristics (jury pool representation ratios in
ST3 and jury pool gender, age, and zip code characteristics in ST4) on 14 defendant and case
characteristics. If the jury pool were truly randomly assigned to cases, the regression
coefficients would be close to zero and statistically insignificant. This is indeed what we find:
only 5 (16) of the 168 coefficients are significant at the 5% (10%) levels and F-tests that jointly
determine whether all coefficients equal zero are insignificant in each regression.
       In this way, as a result of the random and quasi-random processes that generate the jury
pool for each trial, some trials are effectively randomly assigned to jury pools with many
potential jurors from over-represented zip codes, while others are assigned to pools with a
relatively high percentage of jurors from under-represented zip codes. By isolating this quasi-
random variation in the composition of jury pools, we can identify the causal impact of variation
in the neighborhoods from which jurors are drawn on trial outcomes. Though these institutional
features ensure that the jury pool is random, the voir dire process ensures that the seated jury is
not; as we therefore cannot identify the causal effect of the seated jury on trial outcomes, our
analysis only estimates the causal effect of representation in the jury pool.7
       Figure 2 graphically examines the relationship between sentence length and the
proportion of the jury pool from zip codes in the fourth (or first) quartile of the distribution of
representation ratios among jury pool members. Jurors in the fourth quartile consist of the 25%
of jury pool members that come from zip codes with the highest representation ratios.8 The
graphs present the results from local polynomial regressions, which smooth the scatterplot
between two variables so that their relationship can be represented by a simple curve.
       Figure 2 shows that, for Black defendants, increasing the share of the jury pool that comes
from the fourth quartile of the representation index distribution (i.e., the zip codes that are the
most over-represented) results in substantial increases in sentence lengths. We assess the
significance and robustness of these graphical patterns by regressing trial outcomes on the
proportion of the jury pool from quartiles one and four of the representation ratio, where the
reference group includes those in quartiles two and three. We estimate these regressions
separately for the sub-samples of White, Black, and Hispanic defendants in Appendix Table
ST5. These results indicate that the impact of increasing the share of jurors from the fourth


7
  Using the composition of the jury pool to instrument for the composition of the seated jury cannot remedy the
non-random nature of the seated jury because it requires the strong assumption that the only channel through which
the presence of jurors with certain characteristics in the pool affects trial outcomes is by increasing their likelihood
of being seated. This assumption is unrealistic because jurors in the pool can impact trial outcomes even if they
are not seated due to the fact that having to strike them impacts the jurors that do get on.
8
  These quartile cutoffs were defined with the full jury pool sample used for the analysis in Section 4.


                                                                                                                      7
quartile on the length of sentences Black defendants receive is strong and statistically
significant. This significant effect is seen in both the entire sample of matched cases as well as
the analysis sample of life sentence eligible cases, though the effects in the life cases are larger.
Moreover, ST6 demonstrates that this effect on Black defendants is robust to concerns about
our measure of sentence length, which may have a number of outliers in the sentencing
distribution given that Texas codes life sentences as 99 years. Yet, regardless of how sentence
length is measured (in log forms, recoding sentences to be truncated when the individual
reaches age 90, or the sentence length upon first eligibility for parole), Black defendants have
longer sentences when more jurors from quartile four are present. Additionally, ST6 shows that
this relationship is not just observed at the mean of the distribution but also at the median and
some higher percentiles (70th and 80th) of the sentence length distribution for Black defendants.
        The panel for white defendants in Figure 2 indicates their sentences are somewhat longer
when a higher fraction of the jury pool comes from zip codes in the first quartile of the
representation index distribution, although Table ST5 shows this impact is not statistically
significant. Table ST5 also indicates that the fraction of jurors from over- and under-represented
neighborhoods does not have a statistically significant impact on outcomes for Hispanic
defendants.


6. Simulating Equal Representation
        Section 4 showed clear evidence that individuals from certain zip codes are over-
represented in jury pools, and Section 5 showed that having a higher concentration of these
types of jurors in the pool impacts sentence length for Black defendants. Ideally, jury pools
should reflect the local population, and thus a natural question to ask is: how would sentences
change if residents from Harris County neighborhoods were equally represented in jury pools?
        To answer this question, we simulate the average sentence length for defendants under
equal jury representation. We do this in two steps. First, we estimate equation (2) below, which
relates the sentence length to the proportion of members of the jury pool in each quartile of the
zip code representation distribution.


  (2)            Sentence Lengthi = 1*Proportion_Quartile1i + 2*Proportion_Quartile2i +
                    3*Proportion_Quartile3i + 4*Proportion_Quartile4 + 


We then use the resulting estimated coefficients to predict average sentences for Black and
white defendants if the proportion of jury pool members from each quartile reflected the


                                                                                                   8
proportion of the Harris County population (over age 16) that actually resides in the
neighborhoods within the respective quartile. In particular, while the proportion of the jury pool
that comes from the zip codes in each quartile is 0.25 (by construction), the proportions of the
jury pool that should come from zip codes in the quartile 1 through 4 bins are: 0.46, 0.24, 0.18,
and 0.12, respectively. Adjusting these values provides an estimate of what sentence lengths
would be if the jury pool accurately reflected the distribution of the Harris County population
across neighborhoods.
      We extend this initial simulation in two key ways. First, we increase the number of bins
used to group zip codes from the initial four quantiles to 19 evenly spaced intervals of the
representation ratio index. This approach more effectively re-weights zip codes so that the
simulated representation ratio is close to one for each neighborhood. Second, in addition to
examining simulated changes in average sentence length, we also consider how equal
representation would change both the proportion of defendants convicted of a life sentence
(using a logit model) and the median and 75th quantiles of sentence length (using quantile
regressions). We look at these outcomes to gauge the extent to which the likelihood of receiving
a life sentence drives the results for average sentence length.
      The simulation results are presented in Table 2. Each row corresponds to a different
simulation for white or Black defendants, varying the number of bins in which zip codes are
grouped (4 versus 19) and the outcome parameter simulated. The first two columns show a
comparison between the actual value of the parameter of interest and that predicted by the model
-- i.e., the fitted value using the proportion of the jury pool that comes in a given representation
bin in the data. In all cases, the model produces estimates that are close to the actual values.
The next column then presents the simulated results when the proportions are adjusted to zip
code population shares.
      The results for Black defendants are striking. If the jury pool were reflective of the county,
the average sentence would fall by almost 15 years (using the 19-bin specification), and the
median sentence length would essentially be cut in half, from 31.5 to 16 years. The likelihood
Black defendants would be convicted of a life sentence would also fall by more than 50 percent.
The magnitudes of these reductions in sentence length under equal representation are substantial
precisely because they sharply reduce the proportion of jurors from quartile 4 neighborhoods,
who are particularly harmful to Black defendants.
      The simulation results for white defendants generally indicate that they would have longer
sentences if juries were more representative of the population, although these impacts are never
close to being statistically significant. This pattern of results is consistent with the pattern shown


                                                                                                    9
in Figure 2-- i.e., increasing the fraction of jurors from quartile 1 neighborhoods increases
sentence lengths for white defendants. But given the limited sample size, we lack the statistical
power to make precise predictions for white defendants.


7. What Aspects of Over-Represented Neighborhoods Matter?
       The results from Sections 5 and 6 clearly show that the current pattern of unequal
neighborhood representation in Harris County sharply increases the severity of punishment for
Black defendants; no further analysis is needed to reach a strong causal conclusion. We now
try to get a sense of which aspects of these over-represented neighborhoods might be driving
this causal result. Recall from Table 1 that over-represented neighborhoods have a higher
proportion of white, high-income, highly educated, and US-born residents. To investigate
whether each of these characteristics is associated with sentence severity for Black defendants,
the first column of Table 3 regresses whether an individual was convicted of a life sentence on
controls for the composition of the jury pool, including age, gender, and neighborhood racial
composition.9 Successive columns then add other neighborhood controls, including median
family income, percentage of residents who are high school graduates and percentage foreign
born. Except for age and gender, all other jury pool characteristics reflect the characteristics of
the zip codes in which members of the jury pool reside.
       For the analysis presented in Table 3, we use average neighborhood measures for the jury
pool designed to distinguish neighborhoods that are more likely to be in the most over-
represented quartile (i.e., the 4th quartile in Figure 2). For example, our preferred measure of
neighborhood racial composition is the fraction of the jury pool that resides in zip codes that
are at least 60 percent white, as a quarter of jury pool members meet this criterion. As a result,
the interpretation of the results for racial composition in Table 3 should be thought of as the
impact of adding more jurors from the most predominantly white zip codes in Harris County.
       The results indicate that jury pools with more members from predominately white
neighborhoods are associated with a sharp increase in the likelihood that Black defendants
receive a life sentence. That this measure of neighborhood racial composition does not
significantly impact outcomes for white defendants is not surprising, as the proportion of jurors

 We focus on the likelihood of being convicted of a life sentence in this analysis (as opposed to sentence length)
because Table 2 indicates the strongest impacts of jury representation are felt at this decision point.


                                                                                                               10
in the most over-represented zip codes does not impact trial outcomes for this group, as shown
in Figure 2.10, 11


8. Conclusions and Policy Implications
       The main goal of this paper has been to examine the consequences of unequal jury
representation on trial outcomes and the severity of punishment for defendants. With potential
remedies in mind, we introduce a novel measure of jury representation based on the
neighborhoods from which jurors are drawn. While the law requires juries to reflect their local
communities, our analysis shows that juries, and indeed jury pools, in Harris County, Texas,
are highly unrepresentative and that the geographic composition of jurors matters. Black
defendants receive much harsher punishments when they face a jury pool with a higher fraction
of potential jurors from the most over-represented neighborhoods. Simulating outcomes under
fair representation implies that the current unequal jury representation doubles the median
sentence length for Black defendants and more than triples their likelihood of receiving a life
sentence when eligible.
       Although only a small fraction of criminal cases make it to a jury trial, the events that
happen at this stage can have a dramatic impact on the overall criminal justice process for all
criminal incidents--in particular, prosecutors' decisions to go forward with a case, as well as
the plea deals they are willing to accept, will depend in part on how they think the case might
be perceived by the set of jurors that typically show up for jury duty (26). This indicates that
addressing the unrepresentativeness of jury pools can have important consequences for fairness
far beyond what happens in jury trials. Though a number of potential policy and legal remedies
are available to mitigate the bias observed in the Harris County jury system, the effectiveness
of each measure will depend on the various sources of the unequal jury representation. As
highlighted at the very beginning of this article, the first step in the selection process is the
source list itself. Texas currently only includes on its jury source lists residents who have
registered to vote or who have a state driver's license or identification card. Though these are
by far the most common mandated source lists across states, a number of states permit the courts
to supplement the master list with additional sources (e.g. income and property tax rolls,



10
   There appears to be a positive relationship between the fraction of foreign-born residents and sentence length
for white defendants.
11
   Table ST7 presents parallel results for alternative measures of neighborhood racial composition and outcomes.
Because most jury controls vary only at the zip code level and are relatively coarse, the results are somewhat
sensitive to specification choice. We thus view the analysis of this section as suggestive rather than conclusive.


                                                                                                               11
unemployment compensation lists, and welfare lists) that may be more likely to include the
under-represented populations (17).
      Yet, expanded source lists can only do so much if non-response is markedly unequal
across neighborhoods and populations. Non-response can arise through multiple channels,
including: (i) summons not actually reaching the intended recipient, perhaps due to an out-of-
date address, (ii) court-sanctioned reasons, such as having a criminal record or being the sole
care-giver of a small child, and (iii) an active choice, which could, for instance, arise out of not
being able to miss work (due to both job-security or income related issues), as well as due to a
general distrust in the criminal justice system (12). It is reasonable to expect that all three non-
response channels are more prevalent in poor, less educated, minority neighborhoods. Though
more frequent updating of source lists can potentially address concerns about transient
individuals and informational campaigns (on the significant impact a single minority juror can
have on trial outcomes (1)) can potentially increase active choice, none of the above-mentioned
policy responses can deal with the unequal eligibility.
      This brings us to a final possible policy response ­ and one that is a direct implication of
the analyses presented here. A straightforward way to ensure a balanced distribution of jurors
across neighborhoods would be to oversample residents from under-represented neighborhoods
in calls for jury duty, so that jury panels properly reflect the community. An attractive feature
of this remedy is that it equalizes representation across neighborhoods regardless of the
underlying reason for any systematic unequal representation. A handful of jurisdictions have
implemented this kind of over-sampling policy at a relatively low administrative cost (20). Even
if the extent or causal impact of unequal representation on juries is not as severe as in Harris
County, this kind of simple test for representativeness by neighborhood (zip code), along with
a corresponding remedy for any systematic unrepresentativeness, would make juries more
representative of their communities, as the law requires, and jury trials fundamentally fairer in
any jurisdiction that implements them.

Note ­ Each row corresponds to a different simulation for white and black defendants, varying the number of bins to group zip codes (4 versus 19) and the outcome
or parameter simulated. In the 19-bin simulations, the first 18 bins are intervals with a width of 0.1 beginning at a representation ratio of 0.2; the last bin includes
all zip codes with a ratio greater than 2. We use a logit model when estimating the proportion convicted of a life sentence, and a quantile regression when predicting
the median and 75th percentile. The table presents the actual value of the parameter of interest, and the simulated value when jury pools are reflective of the

1. Data Appendix
1.1. Data Description and Sample Creation
We received two data sets from the Harris County Clerk's Office: a defendant data set and a
jury data set. The defendant data includes information on every felony case a jury made a
decision on (verdict and/or sentencing) between May 31, 2005 and March 29, 2012. The
defendant data included information on the name, date of birth, gender, zip code of residence,
and criminal history of the defendant, as well as the case number, offense category and degree,
verdict, sentence, date of filing and disposition. The defendant's race was provided, but their
ethnicity was not; we used the defendant's name to code whether they were Hispanic or not.12
To find information on the start and end dates of the defendant's jury trial, and whether
convicted defendants chose either a jury or a judge to sentence them, we used the defendant's
name and case number to look up that information in the online Harris County Criminal
Records system.13
We organized the data at the defendant-jury level, so that a defendant with multiple charges
that went to the same jury was coded as one observation. We only kept cases where a jury
verdict was listed, and then dropped the subset of these cases where the jury only did the
sentencing (after the defendant had already pled guilty), leaving us with 2,365 cases. There are
three types of case categories that remain: (1) cases where the jury made the decision to convict,
but a judge did the sentencing; (2) cases where the jury made the decision to convict and did
the sentencing; and (3) cases where the jury made the decision to acquit. For the cases in the
last category, we do not observe who the defendant chose to do the sentencing if the jury had
convicted them. However, we treat cases in this category as the jury sentencing the defendant
to a sentence of zero years.
The juror demographic data set has the following information for each of the approximately
309,000 jurors that were empaneled for a jury trial between May 31, 2005 and March 14, 2012:
case number, panel identification number, panel status (i.e., on the seated jury, struck, or
dismissed), the juror's position in the panel, gender, birth date, and zip code of residence, as
well as the date and time they were assigned to the panel, and the date and time they were
released from the panel.14 Using the juror's zip code, we merge census data on the juror's
neighborhood, including the racial composition, median income, population size, high school
graduation rate, share with income below poverty, and share foreign born.
Samples for Descriptive Analyses of Jury Pool and Defendant Representation in Section 4
Section 4 of the paper presents a separate descriptive analysis of zip code representation in the
jury pool and defendant populations and thus does not require a match of these two data sets.
These analyses are thus based on the full datasets outlined above, with a few sample restrictions
as described here related to the validity of the zip code variable in each dataset. Specifically,

12
   To determine whether a defendant was Hispanic, we first identified the list of the 600 most popular Hispanic
surnames using census data. If a defendant's surname was on that list, we classified them as Hispanic. However,
after doing this we found there were still many defendants that were coded as "white" that had distinctively
Hispanic names. We thus went through the white defendants and manually coded them as Hispanic based on
whether their name sounded Hispanic. For defendants that were subsequently incarcerated, one can manually
look up these defendants in the Department of Corrections records where Hispanic status is coded. We did this
for a random sample of the cases we manually coded (where the defendant was subsequently incarcerated) and
found that our manual classifications were always correct. We also pulled out defendants that were classified as
white but had distinctively Arab sounding names and coded them as "other".
13
   See http://www.hcdistrictclerk.com/Edocs/Public/search.aspx.
14
   Not all jury pools that were empaneled for a trial actually tried a case. Sometimes the case they were empaneled
for was delayed and the entire panel was dismissed.
we exclude jurors and defendants with missing zip code information, zip codes not matched to
the 2010 Census, and zip codes outside Harris County. This yields an analysis sample of
299,945 jury pool members and 1,754 defendants from 129 zip codes from which we calculate
jury and defendant representation ratios.
Constructing the Sample to Examine the Effect of Jury Composition on Trial Outcomes Used
in Sections 5-7
Examining the impact of jury pool composition on trial outcomes required matching the
defendant and jury pool data sets. Before conducting this match there were a few additional
drops we made.15 With respect to the defendant data set, we dropped 65 cases where the
defendant was not a white, Black, or Hispanic individual. We also dropped all of the 172 capital
cases as there was no real outcome variation among these cases; only one defendant was not
convicted. With these sample restrictions there are 2,128 cases remaining that can be
potentially matched to the jury data. With respect to the jury data, we dropped jury panels for
which we could not identify a seated jury. As noted to us by the court clerk, the panel status
variable is not fully reliable, as sometimes everyone in the pool is incorrectly listed as struck.
We thus used the jury panel's assignment and release dates to help determine who on the seated
jury was seated or not, and dropped panels where this determination could not be made.16
A key issue that limited the ability to match the jury data with the defendant data is that the
case number attached to a jury panel was sometimes wrong; this problem was noted to us by
the court clerk when the data was provided. The court clerk also provided us with 62 defendant-
jury panel matches from the sample (the "test sample") that the office had manually matched
and knew to be correct. This test sample allowed us to determine in what specific situations
the case number attached to a jury panel would be incorrect, and to develop an algorithm that
would allow the defendant data to be matched to the jury data. We detail the algorithm we
developed in the next section. Our algorithm only allows us to match 1,316 of the 2,128 cases.
However, we are very confident in the matches for those cases, as all cases in the test sample
for which our algorithm could find a match were correct. As we show in Table ST1, the
matched sample is relatively similar to the unmatched sample, except the matched sample has
more female defendant and murder cases, as we more aggressively tried to match these cases.
This sample of 1,316 cases includes 329 cases where the jury makes the conviction decision
and the judge makes the sentencing decision. Because in the majority of the cases the jury
makes both decisions, and we want to look at both the conviction and sentencing stage
simultaneously for our main outcome, we drop the 329 cases where the judge conducts the
sentencing and consider only those remaining cases where the jury makes both decisions.

15
   Note that the defendant and jury data sets we start with here are not the same as those used in Section 4, because
we do not make the same zip code drops as were done there. Specifically, the only drop made based on zip code
is that any panel where the jurors zip codes were missing were dropped--this was done at the end of the matching
process and resulted in six cases being dropped.
16
   Any panel for which the panel status identified between 12-15 members as being on the seated jury was treated
as correct, as this is the expected number of seated jurors for a trial (including alternates). For cases that did not
fall into this category, we used the jury panel's assignment and release dates to help identify the seated jurors.
Specifically, jurors that are seated should be released at a time that will be equal to the time at which the last juror
in that panel is released. If the number of potential jurors that are released at the latest time is between 12-15, we
identify these jurors as the seated jurors. We could not identify a seated jury in cases that did not fall into either
of the above two categories. This could either be because there was no seated jury, or because the data does not
allow us to identify it. Note that we are only identifying jurors that are seated versus not. For jurors that are not
seated, we do not seek to distinguish between whether they were struck for cause, dismissed via peremptory
challenge, or not reached.
Finally, we omit 6 cases where the main variables of interests ­ i.e. zip code characteristics and
representation ratios ­ cannot be created because the juror zip codes were missing for these
cases.
Of these 981 cases that remain, about 75% are life sentence eligible, either because of the
severity of the current offenses or a combination of the current offense and criminal history.
As noted in Section 3, all results presented in Sections 5-7 are run on the sample of 734 trials
where a life sentence is a possible outcome.


1.2. Matching Jury Pool and Defendant Trial Data Sets
This section details the reasons why it was difficult to match the defendant data to the jury data,
and describes the matching algorithm we developed. The Harris County Clerk's office provided
information regarding why some of the cases were difficult to match; they also manually
matched 62 defendant cases to the correct jury panel and provided this to us. This test sample
is what allowed us to better understand the specific reasons the cases were difficult to match,
and allowed us to develop an algorithm whose accuracy could be checked. While the eventual
algorithm we developed only allowed us to match 62% of our defendant sample, the accuracy
of this matching method for the test sample was 100%.

The key difficulty in developing a crosswalk for the jury and defendant datasets was that the
case number that was attached to a jury panel was sometimes incorrect. As noted by the court
clerk, a jury panel would be pulled for a case that was supposed to go to trial that day. The
jury panel would then be assigned the case number for that trial. However, sometimes that jury
trial got delayed, or a plea deal was struck, and the jury panel ended up being assigned to a
different case that went to trial that day. Unfortunately, the old case number remained linked
to the jury panel. Thus matching cases and jury panels up on case number alone is not a
sufficient matching method.

A second related issue is that because jury trials get delayed, there are sometimes multiple
panels that are assigned to a given case number. The first few panels that were called for case
A could have then been seated for another case, or dismissed completely. Again, one cannot
just do a straight case number match between the data sets, as it would result in many different
panels being assigned to a case, when only one actually saw the case.

A third issue is that sometimes a defendant is on trial for multiple charges, where each charge
has a different case number. The jury panel is only attached to one of those case numbers, even
though they issued verdicts on all of the charges. However, sometimes a defendant will have
some of the charges dismissed right before the jury trial, but the jury panel will still be attached
to one of these dismissed charges. As this dismissed charge is not one where a jury rendered
a verdict, there is no case number match in the defendant data set.

Below we discuss the specific matching algorithm we used:
1) Only jury panels that had an identifiable seated jury were eligible to be matched. Note
that if a jury panel assigned to case A did not have any seated jurors, it implies that while it
was originally assigned to case A, it was dismissed because case A ended up not going to trial
that day. However, as we discussed above, it was sometimes difficult to tell if a jury had seated
jurors. There is thus a possibility we are dropping some juries that in fact did have a seated
jury, which eliminates some potential matches.
2) If there was a case number match between a defendant and a jury panel, and the
disposition date in the defendant data was within 6 days of the last release date for the
matched jury panel, this was classified as a match. Note that if the jury trial was pulled for
case A on day X, and case A went to trial on day X, the match should be correct. This is
because cases only get incorrectly matched when the original trial is delayed and the new panel
seated for case A is also misclassified; however, if this were to happen, the dates for case A's
trial would not match the jury panel start and release date. Because there is likely to be some
margin of error on the date variables, we allowed the dates to be within 6 days of each other.
17,18
       Note that often there were multiple panels associated with one case number. If we could
not identify a unique panel whose release date was within six days of the disposition date, we
did not classify it as a match.

3) If a jury panel had a case number that corresponded to a dismissed charge for
defendant A, we classified that panel as having tried the other charges for defendant A
that did go to trial. This matching process was conducted by first pulling a defendant's name
that had not been matched by the previous process. We looked the defendant's name up in
Harris County's online criminal records system and found all charges (which will have unique
case numbers) that would have gone to trial at around the same time. We often found that some
of the charges had been dismissed right before the case for the other charges went to trial. For
each of these dismissed charges, we tried to match the associated case number to a jury panel.
If we found a jury panel that had a matching case number, and the trial disposition and juror
release dates were within 6 days, this was classified as a match. This was an extremely tedious
matching process, and thus we only attempted to do this with defendant groups we wanted to
increase the sample size for. These groups included cases with murder charges (as these were
the most serious charges in our sample), and cases with female defendants (as we thought we
might be able to conduct comparisons of female and male defendants).

To analyze how our match process performed we used the test sample provided by the county
clerk which provided the correct defendant-jury panel matches for 62 defendant cases. Using
our above described matching procedure, we could identify matches for 57 of the 62 cases.
Comparing our identified matches with the correct matches the clerk provided indicated that
our algorithm got all of these matches correct. Thus, the upside to our match algorithm is that
all of the matches it makes seem to be correct. The downside is that there will be cases (five
in the test sample) for which we cannot find a match. For the five test cases we couldn't match,
we used the jury panel that was identified to be correct in the test sample.

Applying our matching algorithm to the full sample of 2,128 cases allowed us to match 1,316
cases. Note that a likely reason the fraction of cases we were able to match in the full sample
was smaller than in the test sample is because we only used step 3 in our algorithm described
above on a select sample of cases, although we performed this step for all cases in the test
sample. Because we are unable to match a reasonable fraction of the defendant sample, it is
important to examine how the unmatched sample compares to the matched sample. Table ST1
compares the defendant and case characteristics between the matched and the unmatched
sample. The results reveal that the matched sample has more females and more murder cases.
This is to be expected as we only tried step 3 in our algorithm on these cases, and thus they

17
   93.4% of the resulting matched sample has a defendant disposition date that is within one day of the jury's last
release date.
18
   If the original trial is cancelled (e.g. the defendant takes a plea deal), there is no possibility of a match, as the
case number the jury was pulled for will correspond to a defendant that did not have a jury trial and is thus not in
the defendant data set.
compose a higher fraction of the matched sample. The fact that the matched sample has
roughly double the murder cases than the unmatched sample is likely the reason that we find
the matched sample has a larger proportion of life-sentence eligible cases and first and second
degree felonies, and that the average incarceration length is longer. This implies that if we had
not tried to overmatch female defendant and murder cases, the ability to match a defendant to
their jury panel would have been relatively random.
