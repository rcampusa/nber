         In this article we examine the Equity Premium in the Indian context and review the related
literature. The equity premium is the returned earned by a well-diversified stock portfolio in excess
of that earned by a risk free security such as a Treasury Bill. Consistent with U.S. experience we find
that the Indian equity premium has been quite high in the post 1991 period, averaging 9.7% above
the corresponding risk free security. It is difficult to justify such a premium based on theoretical
considerations.

       The equity premium is the return earned by a risky security, such as a stock, in

excess of that earned by a risk free security, such as a Treasury Bill. It is a crucial input

into financial decisions such as asset allocation, capital budgeting and planning for

retirement.

       Historical data provide a wealth of evidence documenting that over long periods

of time, stock returns have been considerably higher than returns for T-bills. As Table 1

shows, the average annual real return (that is, the inflation-adjusted return) on the U.S.

stock market for the past 115 years has been about 7.5 percent. In the same period, the

real return on a relatively riskless security was a paltry 1.0 percent.


                                       Table 1.

              1802–2004         6.9%             2.9%                4.0%
              1889–2004          7.5              1.0                 6.5
              1926–2004          8.0              0.7                 7.3
              1947–2004          7.5              0.5                 7.0




       The difference between these two returns, 6.5 percentage points, is the equity

premium. This statistical difference has been even more pronounced in the post-World

War II period. Data on U.S. stock and bond returns going back to 1802 reveal a similar,

although somewhat smaller, premium for the past 200 years.

       Furthermore, this pattern of excess returns to equity holdings is not unique to

U.S. capital markets. Table 2 documents that equity returns in other developed

countries also exhibit this historical regularity when compared with the return to

riskless debt holdings.

       The annual return on the U.K. stock market, for example, was 5.7 percent in the

post-WWII period, an impressive 4.6% premium over the average bond return of 1.1

percent. Similar statistical differences have been documented for France, Germany, and

Japan. And together, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and

France account for more than 85 percent of capitalized global equity value.

       Table 3 details the equity premium for India for the “post liberalization” period,

using both the BSE 100 and the Sensex index as a proxy for the return on equity. Since
                                              5


participation in the T-bill market was highly regulated before 2000, we report the equity

premium relative to the Bank Deposit Rate, using the later as a proxy for the return on

a risk free security.

        One can gain additional insights by examining what these differential rates imply

for the time it takes to double one’s money. Using rates in India over the 1991-2004

period, the doubling period for investments in stocks is about 6 years compared to about

55 years for investments in a risk free asset. This kind of long-term perspective

underscores the remarkable wealth-building potential of the equity premium and

highlights why it is of central importance in portfolio allocation decisions, in making

estimates of the cost of capital, and in the current debate about the advantages of

investing Social Security Trust or retirement funds in the stock market.

A Premium for Bearing Risk?

Why has the rate of return on stocks in India and other countries been significantly

higher than the rate of return on relatively risk free assets? An intuitive answer is that

stocks are “riskier” than bonds and investors require a premium for bearing this

additional risk. Indeed, the standard deviation of the returns to stocks in India (about

30 percent a year historically) is larger than that of the returns to T-bills (about 2

percent a year), so obviously, stocks are considerably riskier than bills.

       But are they? Figure 1 illustrates the variability in the annual real rate of return

on the BSE 100 Index while Figure 2 shows the variability of a relatively risk free

security over the 1991–2004 period.

       To enhance and deepen our understanding of the risk-return trade-off in the

pricing of financial assets, we make a detour into modern asset pricing theory and look

at why different assets yield different rates of return. The deux ex machina of this

theory is that assets are priced such that, ex-ante, the loss in marginal utility incurred

by sacrificing current consumption and buying an asset at a certain price is equal to the

expected gain in marginal utility contingent on the anticipated increase in consumption

when the asset pays off in the future.

       The operative emphasis here is the incremental loss or gain in well being due to

incremental consumption, which must be differentiated from the incremental

consumption itself. This is because the same amount of incremental consumption may

result in different degrees of well-being at different times. A five-course dinner after a

heavy lunch, for example, yields considerably less satisfaction than a similar dinner

when one is hungry!

       As a consequence, assets that pay off when times are good and consumption

levels are high, i.e. when the incremental value of additional consumption is low, are less

desirable than those that pay off an equivalent amount when times are bad and

additional consumption is both desirable and more highly valued.

       Let us illustrate this principle in the context of the standard, popular paradigm,

the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This model postulates a linear relationship

between an asset’s ‘beta’, a measure of systematic risk, and expected return. Thus, high
                                           11


beta stocks yield a high-expected rate of return. That is so because in the CAPM, good

times and bad times are captured by the return on the market. The performance of the

market as captured by a broad based index acts as a surrogate indicator for the relevant

state of the economy. A high beta security tends to pay off more when the market

return is high, that is, when times are good and consumption is plentiful; as discussed

earlier, such a security provides less incremental utility than a security that pays off

when consumption is low, is less valuable to investors and consequently sells for less.

Thus assets that pay off in states of low marginal utility will sell for a lower price than

similar assets that pay off in states of high marginal utility. Since rates of return are

inversely proportional to asset prices, the latter class of assets will, on average, give a

lower rate of return than the former.

       Another perspective on asset pricing emphasizes that economic agents prefer to

smooth patterns of consumption over time. Assets that pay off a relatively larger

amount at times when consumption is already high, “destabilize” these patterns of

consumption, whereas assets that pay off when consumption levels are low, “smooth”

out consumption. Naturally, the latter are more valuable and thus require a lower rate

of return to induce investors to hold these assets. (Insurance policies are a classic

example of assets that smooth consumption. Individuals willingly purchase and hold

them, in spite of their very low rates of return.)

       To return to the original question: are stocks so much more riskier than bills so

as to justify a 7% differential in their rates of return as observed in the U.S?
                                          12


       What came as a surprise to many economists and researchers in finance was the

conclusion of a research paper that Edward Prescott and I wrote in 1979. Stocks and

bonds pay off in approximately the same states of nature or economic scenarios and

hence, as argued earlier, they should command approximately the same rate of return.

In fact, using standard theory to estimate risk-adjusted returns, we found that stocks in

the U.S on average should command, at most, a 1% return premium over bills. Since,

for as long as we had reliable data, (about a hundred years), the mean premium on

stocks over bills was considerably and consistently higher, we realized that we had a

puzzle on our hands. It took us six more years to convince a skeptical profession and for

our paper “ The Equity Premium: A Puzzle” to be published. (Mehra and Prescott

(1985)).

       For the purpose of this article, I have done a similar analysis for India using the

data in Table 6, which contains the sample statistics for the Indian economy for the

1991–2004 period.




                                   Table 6
                 Indian Economy Sample Statistics, 1991–2004

           Risk-free rate, Rf                             1.0128
           Mean return on equity, E (Re)                  1.126
           Mean growth rate of consumption, E (x)         1.0227
           Standard deviation of growth rate of
            consumption, σ(x)                             0.0224
           Mean equity premium, E (Re) – Rf               0.113
                                          13


        I find that the theoretical equity premium should be in the range 0.02% to 0.16%

if the coefficient of risk aversion is varied from 2 to 10. Since the observed risk premium

in India is an order of magnitude more, we have a puzzle with respect to Indian data as

well.

        I want to emphasize that the equity premium puzzle is a quantitative puzzle.

Standard theory is qualitatively consistent with our notion of risk: stocks do, on

average, return more than bonds in the theoretical model. The puzzle arises from the

fact that the quantitative predictions of the theory are an order of magnitude different

from what has been historically documented. The puzzle cannot be dismissed lightly

because much of our economic intuition and policy directives are based on the very class

of models that fall short so dramatically when confronted with financial data. It

underscores the failure of paradigms central to financial and economic modeling to

capture the characteristic that appears to make stocks comparatively so risky. Hence,

the viability of using this class of models for any quantitative assessment—for example,

to gauge the welfare implications of alternative stabilization policies—is thrown open to

question.

        For this reason, over the past 20 years or so, attempts to resolve the puzzle have

become a major research impetus in finance and economics. Several generalizations of

key features of the Mehra–Prescott (1985) model have been proposed to reconcile

observations with theory, including alternative assumptions about preferences, modified

probability distributions to admit rare but disastrous events, survivorship bias,
                                          14


incomplete markets, and market imperfections. None have satisfactorily resolved the

puzzle.

          Recently some researchers and analysts have argued that ex-ante equity premium

is likely to be low. The data used to document the equity premium (over the past 100

years in some instances) represents as reliable an economic data set as analysts have,

and 100 years is long series when it comes to economic data. Before the equity premium

is dismissed, not only do researchers need to understand the observed phenomena, but

they also need a plausible explanation as to why the future is likely to be any different

from the past. Demographic shifts and changes in participation in equity markets will,

of course, impact on the equity premium in India over time. For instance, greater stock

market participation in particular by the younger generation is likely to reduce the

equity premium. However, before these demographic effects play a role, on the basis of

what is currently known, I make the following assertion: the equity premium in the

future is likely to be similar to what it has been in the past and returns to investment in

equity will continue to substantially dominate returns to investment in T-bills for

investors with long planning horizons.
