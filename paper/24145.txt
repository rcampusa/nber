We assess the role of economic and security considerations in the currency composition of
international reserves. We contrast the “Mercury hypothesis” that currency choice is governed by
pecuniary factors familiar to the literature, such as economic size and credibility of major reserve
currency issuers, against the “Mars hypothesis” that this depends on geopolitical factors. Using
data on foreign reserves of 19 countries before World War I, for which the currency composition
of reserves is known and security alliances proliferated, our results lend support to both
hypotheses. We find that military alliances boost the share of a currency in the partner’s foreign
reserve holdings by 30 percentage points. These findings speak to current discussions about the
implications of possible U.S. disengagement from global geopolitical affairs. In a hypothetical
scenario where the U.S. withdraws from the world, our estimates suggest that long-term U.S.
interest rates could rise by as much as 80 basis points, assuming that the composition of global
reserves changes but their level does not.

1.       Introduction

Scholarly work on the national currency used in international transactions
distinguishes two views. One, familiar to economists, emphasizes pecuniary motives.
Safety, liquidity, network effects, trade links and financial connections explain why
some currencies are used disproportionally as a medium of exchange, store of value
and unit of account by governments and private entities engaged in cross-border
transactions (see e.g. Krugman 1980, 1984, Matsuyama, Kiyotaki and Matsui 1993,
Zhou 1997, Rey 2001 and Devereux and Shi 2013). We refer this as the “Mercury
hypothesis.” 1

        Another view, due principally to political economists and applied mainly to
the choice of reserve currency or currencies, emphasizes strategic, diplomatic and
military power. 2 Insofar as a country has such power, governments of other countries
may see it as in their geopolitical interest to conduct the majority of their international
transactions using its currency. That leading power will in turn possess political
leverage with which to encourage the practice (see e.g. Kindleberger 1970, Strange
1971, 1988, Kirshner 1995, Williamson 2012, Cohen 1998, 2015, Liao and McDowell
2016). International currency choice is from Mars, in other words, rather than
Mercury. 3

         This “Mars hypothesis,” when added to the intellectual portfolio of
economists, may help to explain some otherwise perplexing aspects of the currency
composition of international reserves. 4 It may explain why Japan holds a larger share
of its foreign reserves in dollars than China (as illustrated in Figure 1). It may explain
why Saudi Arabia holds the bulk of its reserves in dollars, unlike another oil and
commodity exporter, Russia. It may explain why Germany holds virtually all of its

rely on a foreign currency as a store of value, since such military prowess makes the issuer’s currency a
“safe asset.”

Kagan’s phrase “Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus” (Kagan 2002). An episode
epitomizing the importance of geopolitical motives in international currency choice is the so-called
“Blessing Letter” (see Posen 2008). In the 1960s, West Germany’s peg to the U.S. dollar was seen by
German authorities as problematic because it led to significant imported inflation and overheating.
However, the commitment of the United States to maintaining troops on German soil to deter threats
from the U.S.S.R. was linked to Germany’s maintenance of its U.S. dollar peg and continued
investment in dollar reserves. Under U.S. pressure, Karl Blessing (Bundesbank president at the time)
sent a confidential letter to the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
pledging to keep Germany’s dollar reserves against its best economic interest as a quid pro quo for U.S.
security guarantees.
4
  International relations scholars have looked at specific country cases, such as Spiro (1999) on the
dollar holdings of countries in the Middle-East, or Zimmermann (2011) on those of West Germany in
the period between 1950 and 1971.



                                                                                                       2
official reserves in dollars, unlike France. 5 Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia all
depend on the United States for security; they are U.S. allies and non-nuclear powers. 6
China, Russia, and France, on the other hand, possess their own nuclear weapons as
deterrents against potentials threats. Comparing nuclear-weapon states and states
dependent on the U.S. for their security, as in Figure 1, suggests that the difference in
the share of the U.S. dollar in foreign reserve holdings is on the order of 35
percentage points.

                                        [Figure 1 about here]

       Testing the Mars and Mercury hypotheses is not easy. Causality between
reserve-currency decisions and geopolitics may run in both directions. Not only may
geopolitical alliances and security guarantees encourage a particular pattern of reserve
holdings, but holding a country’s currency may encourage governments to seek out
geopolitical alliances and security guarantees. 7

       Addressing this endogeneity requires a measure of geopolitical leverage that is
exogenous to currency choice and varies across time or space. It requires data on
governments’ decisions about currency choice, insofar as governments remain leading
geopolitical players. The currency composition of official foreign reserves is one
such variable, but central banks and governments regard such data as sensitive and
general treat them as confidential. 8 While information on the composition of reserves



5
  While Germany can’t hold reserves in euros, before 1999 it could hold reserves in European
currencies other than its own, and even today it can hold reserves in inter alia, Japanese yen and British
pounds. Historically, France has been reluctant to hold a large share of its international reserves in
gold, since at least the 1960s when Charles de Gaulle and his finance minister, Valery Giscard
d’Estaing, railed against the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege.” Similarly, France has been reluctant to
participate in the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (unlike Germany), where Germany hosts
thousands of U.S. troops and important U.S. military bases (unlike France).
6
  Historically, the U.S. has guaranteed Germany’s security mainly against Russia, Japan’s mainly
against China, and Saudi Arabia’s mainly against Iran.
7
  Examples from the distant and recent past epitomize the point. After World War II lending by the
U.S. to Europe through the Marshall Plan paved the way for the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Alliance (NATO) and buttressed the greenback’s role amidst Cold War threats and a pervasive shortage
of dollars on the old continent. Dollar liquidity swap lines between the Federal Reserve and foreign
central banks created in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 were given to close U.S.
allies like South Korea and helped solidify the dollar’s international status, notwithstanding the fact
that the crisis had started in the United States. In a similar vein, the People’s Bank of China’s network
of swap lines is believed to serve the ambition to foster the renminbi’s international role and China’s
geopolitical interests.
8
  Data on the currency composition of international reserves are made available to the public by only a
limited number of central banks, as Truman and Wong (2006) describe. The I.M.F. publishes only
global aggregates and, recently, breakdowns between advanced economies and emerging and
developing countries. These underlying data, known as the Currency Composition of Official Foreign
Exchange Reserves (C.O.F.E.R.) data base, are confidential; the individual country data have been used
only by two internal I.M.F. staff studies (Dooley, Lizondo and Mathieson 1989, and Eichengreen and
Mathieson 2001).



                                                                                                        3
is publicly available for a handful of countries and can be estimated for others, it is
difficult to build a large and representative sample for countries today.

        But it is easier to build this kind of sample for earlier periods. Governments
did not always regard data on the composition of reserves as sensitive and confidential
and, even where they did, a more limited menu of options makes it easier for that
composition to be inferred. In this paper we therefore assess the importance of
pecuniary and geopolitical motives in international currency choice using the currency
composition of foreign reserves prior to World War I. We measure geopolitical
motives using data on military alliances, including defense pacts, non-aggression
treaties, neutrality treaties, and ententes. Endogeneity is addressed with an
instrumental variable strategy where the instrument is the presence and rank of
diplomats, suitably lagged and orthogonalized with respect to trade.

        We make use of a panel data set providing detailed information on the foreign
exchange reserves of 19 countries between 1890 and 1913. The data distinguish five
reserve currencies: sterling, the French franc, the German mark, the U.S. dollar and
the Dutch guilder. The period we consider culminated in a full-blown global military
conflict, pointing to the salience of geopolitical considerations. Moreover,
governments and central banks were accumulating significant foreign exchange
essentially for the first time, suggesting that pecuniary and geopolitical motives were
not (yet) dominated by simple habit formation. 9 Although gold was the main reserve
asset, foreign exchange played a significant and growing role. 10 This was an era when
currency choice was, well, a choice. Sterling was the leading reserve unit but, as we
show below, governments and central banks could also hold reserves in German
marks and French francs, among other currencies, if they so chose. 11

        The period leading up to World War I was also one of proliferating security
alliances and defense pacts (Miller 2012). With the industrialization of significant
parts of the European continent in the second half of the 19th century and the creation
of a unified German Empire in 1870-1, the balance of power created by the Concert of
Europe (made up of Austria, Prussia, Russia and Great Britain, the members of the so-
called Quadruple Alliance that defeated France and restored the Bourbon monarchy)
was cast into doubt. Tension among the principal European powers rose further as
they came into conflict over the scramble for African colonies. Germany and Austria-
Hungary reached an understanding about a defense pact, known as the Dual Alliance,
in 1879. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy signed a secret agreement, the Triple
Alliance, in 1882, committing to support one another if any of them was attacked by
either France or Russia, allowing Austro-Hungarian troops to be redeployed from the

   Lindert (1969) estimates that foreign exchange accounted for 16% of official reserves held globally
in 1913.
11
   The Dutch guilder and U.S. dollar played a role as foreign reserve currencies as well. See Lindert
(1969) for an early account of multipolarity in the international monetary system in the 19th century and
Eichengreen, Mehl, and Chiţu (2017) for a recent discussion.



                                                                                                       4
Italian to Russian borders. Partly in response, France and Russia negotiated their own
pact, also known as the Dual Alliance, in 1894; this Dual Alliance was then expanded
into the Triple Entente of Britain, France and Russia, achieved through negotiation of
the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian
Entente in 1907, to counter the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria and Italy. The
traditional interpretation of these alliances is as an attempt to recreate a balance of
power and to balance threats (Walt 1990). We will, of course, have to also consider
the possibility that security alliances grow out prior of economic links (Jackson and
Nei 2015).

        We estimate the influence of pecuniary and geopolitical motives using panel-
data and two-stage least square methodologies. Our results lend support to both
hypotheses. In particular, we find a sizeable geopolitical or security premium in
international currency choice. 12 By our estimates, military alliances boost the share of
the currencies of alliance partners in foreign reserve portfolios by close to 30
percentage points. 13

        This security premium has implications for the benefits accruing to the United
States as issuer of the leading international currency. This status allows the U.S.
government to place dollar-denominated securities at a lower cost because demand
from major reserve holders is stronger than otherwise. The cost to the U.S. of
financing budget and current account deficits is correspondingly less. Our findings
thus suggest that the dollar’s dominance as an international unit is buttressed by the
country’s role as a global power guaranteeing the security of allied nations. If that
role were seen as less sure and that security guarantee as less iron clad, because the
U.S. was disengaging from global geopolitics in favor of more stand-alone, inward-
looking policies, the security premium enjoyed by the U.S. dollar could diminish. 14
Our estimates suggest, in this scenario, that $750 billion worth of official U.S. dollar-
denominated assets – equivalent to 5 percent of US marketable public debt – would be
liquidated and invested into other currencies such as the yen, the euro or the renminbi,
if the composition of global reserves changes but their level remains stable, an event
that would presumably have significant implications for U.S. bond markets and the
dollar exchange rate.


12
   The term “security premium” is from Cohen (2015).
13
   A related paper in political science is Li (2003), who studies the effect of security alliances on
exchange rate regime choice in the Bretton Woods and post-Bretton Woods periods. Our focus is
different, however, insofar as we aim to estimate a geopolitical risk premium, address endogeneity
between currency choice and security alliances, and examine official foreign reserves in order to study
the implications of our findings for America’s “exorbitant privilege”.
14
   For instance, UN Secretary-General António Guterres declared on 20 June 2017 that: “If the United
States disengages in relation to many aspects of foreign policy and many aspects of international
relations, it will be unavoidable that other actors will occupy that space. And I don't think this is good
for the United States, and I don't think this is good for the world.” In a similar vein, Germany’s
Chancellor Angela Merkel declared end-May 2017 that the “the times in which we can fully count on
others [i.e. the U.S.] are somewhat over…We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own
hands.”



                                                                                                         5

Section 4 presents the basic results on the Mercury hypothesis. Section 5 turns to
extended results on the Mars hypothesis, after which Section 6 considers the
instrumental variable estimates. Section 7 examines a scenario analysis, while
Section 8 concludes and draws implications for policy.


2.         Data

Our data on the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves are taken from
Lindert (1967). Lindert built on an earlier data set constructed by Bloomfield (1963),
which provided foreign-exchange-reserve totals but no information on the currency
composition of reserves. Lindert used year-end balance sheets of central banks,
national treasuries, exchange stabilization funds, and commercial banks, and obtained
some data from private correspondence with the institutions in question. The
aggregates for the years 1899 and 1913 that he published in Lindert (1969) remain the
best available estimates of the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves
held globally prior to World War I.

        For this paper we digitized country-level and currency-specific information in
Lindert (1967). This yields annual observations for 19 countries (Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands Indies, Norway, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and
Switzerland) for the apex of the classical gold standard era from 1890 to 1913. 15
Official foreign exchange in five currencies are distinguished: sterling, French francs,
German marks, U.S. dollars, and Dutch guilders.

        The institution in charge of managing foreign exchange reserves in this period
was not always the central bank, since in a non-negligible number of cases central
banks were first established after World War I. In some countries without a central
bank, the treasury held the foreign exchange reserves. In others, reserves were held in
a special fund or account created to manage the currency’s parity to gold. In still
other cases other public-sector banks were involved, such as the Yokohama Specie
Bank in Japan or the Caisse Générale d’Epargne et de Retraite in Belgium. 16 And in a
few countries, such as Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, no official institution
was in charge of managing the currency’s parity to gold; instead the task instead
delegated to private commercial banks.

        The holdings in question were liquid foreign assets, including commercial and
financial bills drawn on foreign places, foreign treasury bills, deposits in foreign

banks, current account balances with banking correspondents abroad, and current
account credits with banking branches abroad. 17

        Figure 2 shows the global stock of foreign exchange reserves by currency in
1899 and 1913 (following Lindert 1969). The overall picture is clearly inconsistent
with the “natural monopoly” view that one currency is in sole possession of this
international-currency role at any point in time. 18 We see how circa 1899 sterling
accounted for the majority (about 65%) of identified foreign exchange reserves. 19 But
French francs and German marks accounted for nonnegligible shares of the total (15%
and 17%, respectively). Sterling’s dominance declined over the subsequent decade
and a half, with gains mainly accruing to the French franc, which was held by Russia
and a number of other countries. In 1913 the share of sterling had fallen to 48%, the
share of the French franc had risen to 31%, and the share of the German mark had
remained stable.

                                      [Figure 2 about here]

         Figure 3 shows the evolution of currency shares between 1890 and 1913. The
sample of countries reporting data varies over time, complicating interpretation, but
the pattern suggests that sterling’s dominance peaked in the early 1890s. 20 Whether
this is due to economic or geopolitical factors remains to be determined.

                                      [Figure 3 about here]

        Figure 4 shows the evolution between 1890 and 1913 of the currency
composition of official foreign exchange holdings by country. Several economies,
generally those with strong political or colonial ties to a major metropolitan center,
held their reserves in a single currency: Australia, Ceylon and India held only sterling;
the Philippines held only dollars; and the Netherlands Indies held only Dutch guilder.
That the countries in question were colonies or dominions of the U.K., the U.S. or the
Netherlands underscores the importance of institutional or geopolitical factors in
international reserve currency choice, as emphasized by inter alia Strange (1988). 21

       The remaining countries held multiple currencies, suggesting that the
aggregate evidence above against the natural-monopoly view is not due to one or a
few large reserve holders. Moreover, the countries in question adjusted the currency
composition of their holdings over the sample period. Here again these changes are

18
   We discuss estimation problems arising from measurement error below.
19
   The dominance of sterling then consequently resembled the dominance of the U.S. dollar now, with
the greenback accounting for roughly two-thirds of global foreign exchange reserves in 2017.
20
   This, too, is inconsistent with the view that international reserve currency status is a natural
monopoly or that a currency’s leader status, once acquired cannot erode rapidly.
21
   Strange referred to currencies held under such circumstances as “master currencies.”



                                                                                                      7
suggestive of political and geopolitical factors. The growing share of German marks
in Austria-Hungary’s reserves went hand in hand with the Triple Alliance, i.e. the
secret agreement between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy signed in 1882 and
renewed periodically until World War I, committing each member to provide mutual
support in the event of an attack by another great power. 22 The increasing importance
of French francs in Russia’s reserves in the years after the Franco-Russian alliance of
1894 highlights a similar point.

                                            [Figure 4 about here]



3.       Specification

Our basic specification follows previous literature (see e.g. Chinn and Frankel 2007,
2008; Li and Liu 2008; Chiţu, Eichengreen and Mehl 2014 and Eichengreen, Mehl
and Chiţu 2016). It models the choice of reserve currency as:


                                                          sizei ,t           credibilityi ,t        (1)
               sharei , j ,t = β1sharei , j ,t −1 + β 2               + β3                      +
                                                          size j ,t          credibility j ,t
                              β′4 Xi, j + α i + α j + λt + ε i , j ,t


where i, j, and t are the country, currency (dyadic) and time dimensions (i = 1…5; j =
1…19; t = 1…23) and share is the share of currency i in country j’s foreign exchange
reserves in year t; X is a vector of control variables; λ a vector of time effects; ε is the
residual; and the βs are the coefficients to estimate. We control for unobserved
heterogeneity by including dyadic-fixed-effects αi,j when X comprises variables that
vary across both dyads and time, such as bilateral trade and financial depth. When the
variables in question vary across dyads only, such as the proxies for international
transaction costs discussed below, we include currency-fixed effects and country-
fixed effects, denoted αi and αj, respectively, as shown in Equation (1).

        We draw on analytical models emphasizing inertia, economic size, credibility,
trade relations and financial depth as pecuniary determinants of international currency
status that underpin the Mercury hypothesis. Triffin (1960) was among the first to
emphasize persistence or inertia effects in international currency use by arguing that it
took from 30 to 70 years, depending on the aspects of economic and international
currency status considered, from when the United States overtook Britain as the
leading economic and commercial power and when the dollar overtook sterling as the
dominant international currency. Persistence or inertia effects also feature in the
models of e.g. Krugman (1980, 1984), Matsuyama, Kiyotaki and Matsui (1993) and

22
  Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance in October 1883, which partly explains its significant
holdings of German marks. See also below for more details.



                                                                                                          8
Rey (2001). We measure the persistence or inertia effects in question with a lagged
dependent variable.

        Economic size is another standard determinant of international currency
choice. It captures the network effects discussed by e.g. Krugman (1980, 1984), who
focused on the increasing returns that result from economies of scale. In his model, a
collective choice to engage in trade using a particular unit reduces transactions costs
associated with that unit, further encouraging the practice. Strategic
complementarities and economies of scale also feature in the random matching model
of Matsuyama, Kiyotaki and Matsui (1993), who model the choice of international
currencies as a double-coincidence-of-wants problem, where the incentive of an agent
to accept a nation’s currency depends on how often he/she trades with a national from
that country. Rey (2001) stresses the self-reinforcing effects on transaction costs of
using a particular unit in foreign exchange markets arising from the pattern of bilateral
trade (what she calls “thick market externalities”). 23 Empirically, we measure
economic size as the output of the country issuing reserve currency i, relative to the
output of reserve holder j, taking data from Maddison (2010).

        Persistence and network effects are distinct, and one does not imply the other.
Persistence can have other sources besides network effects giving rise to first-mover
advantage. Examples include habit formation (see e.g. De Vries 1988) and the
absence of low-cost alternatives to the dominant unit. Conversely, network effects
may increase the attractions of a particular standard (in this case, a currency standard)
at a specific point in time without preventing market participants from shifting to
another standard at the next point in time, assuming that lock-in is weak and agents
can coordinate their actions (as argued by David 1986, 1990). The success with
which open standards for personal electronics have been developed in recent years,
weakening lock-in and facilitating shifts between operating systems, illustrates the
point (West 2007).

        The credibility term is motivated by models in which currency depreciation
can make holding a unit unattractive and discourage its international use, as in
Devereux and Shi (2013). Stability is important for credibility because reserve
holders prefer reliable stores of value and may be reluctant to hold reserves in units
that depreciate by too much or for too long. We measure credibility as time in years
spent by reserve issuer i on the gold standard minus time spent by reserve holder j
taking data from Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). This is in keeping with the observation
that adherence to the gold standard served as a “good housekeeping seal of approval”
strengthening country’s credibility and access to foreign capital (Bordo and Rockoff
1996).

        Trade relations may influence reserve currency status, insofar as commercial
transactions are a source of information useful for informing foreign investment

23
  Devereux and Shi (2013) take the argument to a dynamic general equilibrium model in which vehicle
currencies enable agents to economize on the number of currency trading posts.



                                                                                                 9
decisions (Antràs and Caballero 2007). Trade links may also make foreign
investments more secure insofar as strategic default is deterred by the threat of
commercial retaliation (Rose and Spiegel 2004). Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007), Lane
and Milesi-Ferreti (2008a) and (2008b), Coeurdacier and Martin (2009), Forbes
(2010) and Coeurdacier and Rey (2011) all provide evidence that trade in goods is an
important determinant of trade in assets. We measure trade relations as the logarithm
of the sum of bilateral exports and imports, using data from Jacks, Meissner and Novy
(2011).

        Financial depth is a final pecuniary factor thought to be important in the
choice of reserve currency (as in Portes and Rey 1998 and Papaioannou and Portes
2008). Eichengreen and Flandreau (2012) show that financial deepening was a key
determinant of the rise of dollar-denominated trade credits in the 1920s. Chiţu,
Eichengreen and Mehl (2014) show that financial deepening was the main factor
helping the dollar overcome sterling’s head start as an international financing
currency in the interwar period. Following King and Levine (1993), we measure
financial depth by the financial monetisation ratio (broad money to GDP), taking data
from Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2017). 24

        We include year effects throughout. These capture changes in the structure of
the international monetary and financial system as well as other changes in the world
economy for which we do not otherwise control. In addition, we estimate the
resulting equations with dyadic effects to account for unobserved country-currency
specific variation.

        We implement Equation (1) using ordinary least squares and report standard
errors robust to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity and clustered by dyad (to
control for possible residual correlation between country-currency observations in
each year). 25 In robustness checks we report estimates obtained with a random effects
estimator. Given that a country’s currency shares are bounded between zero and one,
a tobit estimator might have been warranted. However, since our data are censored
neither from above nor from below, this is not necessary. That said, we also report
results using a panel tobit estimator. Finally, insofar as the lagged dependent variable,
our proxy for persistence or inertia, can also reflect serially correlated omitted
variables, we report estimates using the Griliches (1961)-Liviatan (1963) and
Hatanaka (1974) estimators.



4.       Mercury Hypothesis




24
   In robustness checks we also consider the financial intermediation ratio (private credit to GDP); see
below.
25
   Instrumental variables estimates are also reported below.



                                                                                                      10
Table 1 presents the benchmark results, where the four pecuniary variables are entered
first one-by-one and then together. Half of the adjustment to the long run in
international currency shares in global foreign reserves is estimated to occur in a
single year, ceteris paribus. This is lower than the 0.9 estimate of Chinn and Frankel
(2007, Table 8.4, p. 303) using reserve data for 1973-1998. 26 This suggests that
inertia was weaker and that the currency composition of foreign reserves could
change more rapidly in this earlier era.

        Table 1 lends support to the Mercury hypothesis. To start, credibility
matters: the share of a particular currency in foreign reserves increases significantly
with the time spent on the gold standard, in line with the observation that the latter
served as a “good housekeeping seal of approval.” 27 The full model estimates
(column 6 of Table 1) suggests that the short run (one year) effect of an additional
year on the gold standard is an increase in the share of a particular reserve currency
of about 0.2 percentage point. 28 That by 1899 Britain had been on the gold standard
for 56 years longer than France explains a quarter of the 48 percentage-point
difference in their respective shares of global reserve portfolios, other things equal.

         The coefficient on economic size is positive, in line with theory, but
statistically insignificant (columns 3, 6 and 7). 29 It may be that we lack
heterogeneity sufficient to identify its effect, insofar as three of the five reserve
issuers we consider (the U.K., France and Germany) were of roughly equal size (i.e.
9% to 14% of global output over the sample period, against 23% for the U.S. and 1%
for the Netherlands).

        Data availability is more limited for trade relations and financial depth. 30
Trade relations enter with a positive coefficient, in line with theory, and are
significant at the 15% level (see columns 4 and 6). The effect of financial depth is
positive as well, in line with the findings of earlier studies mentioned above, and
significant at the 15% level, too.

                                        [Table 1 about here]

       Skeptics may worry that we overlook the fact that gold, not currency, was the
main component of official reserves. We address this by re-estimating Equation (1)



26
   When we control for the standard gravity covariates, we still obtain a coefficient on the order of 0.9
(see below).
27
   Again, this is in line with the estimates of Chinn and Frankel (2007), who also found evidence of
significant credibility effects on reserve data for the modern era.
28
   That increase in the share is almost half a percentage point in the long run.
29
   However, insofar as economic size is a dyadic variable, like all variables in vector X it depends on
the economic size of the reserve holding countries and on time as well.
30
   We lose up to half of the observations in the estimates reported in columns (4) to (7).



                                                                                                       11
using currency shares adjusted for gold holdings. 31 The estimates are reported in
Table A2 in the appendix. Again we find that inertia and credibility effects matter
significantly. Magnitudes are comparable to those of the baseline estimates. 32

        Previous studies found that the dyadic covariates typically used in gravity
models, such as common border, common language, common colonial relationship
and geographic distance, influence the geography of international finance and affect
bilateral patterns of cross-border financial flows and holdings. 33 These variables aim
to capture transaction costs or information asymmetries that affect trade and financial
relations between nations; they are sometimes described as picking up “familiarity” or
“connectivity” frictions. We take data on these dyadic covariates from CEPII’s
GeoDist data base. 34

         These are entered one-by-one and then together in Table 2. The estimates
control for currency fixed effects, country effects and time effects. The results
confirm the importance of pecuniary factors, in line with the Mercury hypothesis.
Estimated persistence is now stronger, with the point estimate on lagged currency
share reaching 0.9, while the coefficient estimates on credibility and economic size
are smaller. Conceivably, this reflects the fact that we can no longer control for
dyadic fixed-effects insofar as these would be collinear with the gravity covariates
capturing international transaction costs (which vary across countries but not over
time). When they are significant, a one percentage point relative increase in the share
of global output and an additional year on the gold standard are both associated with
an increase in the share of a particular reserve currency of about 0.4 percentage point
in the long run. The currency composition of foreign exchange reserves tends to be
tilted toward currencies issued by economies vis-à-vis which transactions costs or
information asymmetries are low, i.e. which share a common border, a common
language, a common colonial relationship with reserve currency issuers or are
geographically near the issuers in question (see columns 1 to 4 of Table 2).

       The full model estimates (column 5 of Table 2) suggest that these factors are
economically important. Sharing a common border with a reserve currency issuer is
associated with an increase in the share of the issuer’s currency of more than 5
percentage points in the short run, while a common colonial relationship is associated
31
   Specifically we scale currency shares by the proportion of gold and silver in reserve holders’ total
foreign reserves.
32
   The effects of trade relations and financial depth are no longer statistically significant, but the fact
that we lose a large number of observations due to lack of data for gold holdings for several countries
likely explains much of the loss in estimation efficiency. The effect of economic size is not statistically
significant, as in Table 1.
33
   See e.g. Portes and Rey (2005), Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007), Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2008a) and
(2008b), Forbes (2010).
34
   See Mayer and Zignago (2011). The data consist of binary dummy variables that equal 1 if two
countries are contiguous (common border), share a common official language (common language), and
were ever in a colonial relationship (common colony); distance is the simple distance (in kilometres)
between the two most populated cities of a particular dyad. Gravity covariates have been used in other
studies of international currency status using dyadic panel data, such as He et al. (2015).



                                                                                                        12
with an increase of 7 percentage points. 35 Long-run effects are sizeable, on the order
of 50-70 percentage points.

                                        [Table 2 about here]

        Table 3 examines the robustness of the results to use of a linear random effect
estimator (column 1), and a panel tobit estimator (column 2). Signs, magnitudes, and
significance levels are similar to those in our baseline model. Note that our data are
censored neither from above nor from below (see column 2 of Table 3, last row),
which suggests that tobit estimation is not necessary.

         Interpretation of the lagged dependent variable in terms of inertia will be
problematic if the latter is simply picking up persistent error terms. 36 One treatment is
to instrument the lagged dependent variable with its second lag and the first lags of
the independent variables (see e.g. Griliches, 1961; Liviatan, 1963). This will yield
consistent, albeit inefficient, estimates. 37 Intuitively, including only the predicted
component of lagged currency shares enhances the plausibility that the lag is picking
up genuine inertia effects rather than persistent random errors. Another treatment is
that of Hatanaka (1974), which includes both the fitted value and the residual from the
first-stage regression in the second stage and yields estimates that are both consistent
and efficient.

        Results using these techniques (columns 3 and 4 of Table 3) are close to our
earlier estimates in terms of economic magnitude and sign, but statistical significance
of the estimated coefficients is weaker, with the exception of the coefficient on inertia.
This suggests that there may be omitted variables leading to persistent errors picked
up in the lagged dependent variable, such as geopolitical factors, an explanation to
which we turn below. 38

        Finally, we replaced the monetization ratio with the credit intermediation ratio
as our metric of financial depth and used alternative measures for the common
language dummy and for distance. 39 We dummied out Germany insofar as it is the
only country of our sample that is both a reserve currency issuer and holder. We
controlled for the direction of trade using alternative data sources, including from the



35
   In the full model estimates, the effect of common language is no longer statistically significant.
36
   The combination of serially correlated errors and the lagged dependent variable also introduces the
possibility of biased coefficient estimates due to correlation between the lagged variable and the error
term.
37
   These estimates are inefficient since the adjustment does not correct for error autocorrelation.
38
   This is also argued by e.g. Posen (2008).
39
   We use a common language dummy equalling 1 if a language is spoken by at least 9% of the
population in both countries within a dyad; and we use the simple distance (in kilometres) between the
two capital cities within a dyad as well as a measure of weighted distance (where the weights are the
shares of the cities in the respective country’s population).



                                                                                                      13

5.      Mars Hypothesis

To incorporate geopolitical factors, we modify equation (1) to the form:

                                                      sizei ,t           credibilityi ,t                   (2)
           sharei , j ,t = β1sharei , j ,t −1 + β 2               + β3                      + β′4 X i, j
                                                      size j ,t          credibility j ,t
                        + β 5 alliancei , j ,t + α i + α j + λt + ε i , j ,t


where alliance is an indicator variable equaling 1 if a defense pact, non-aggression
treaty, neutrality treaty or entente is in force between reserve currency issuer i and
reserve holder j in year t, and 0 otherwise. We take data on formal military alliances
among states between 1890 and 1913 from the Correlates of War Project. 41

        One reason why the national security and foreign policy projection capabilities
of reserve currency issuers influence other countries’ decisions to use their currency is
that military alliances put pressure on both sides to link their pursuit of stability,
including monetary stability (Posen 2008). Reserve currency issuers providing
security guarantees may use them as leverage to obtain finance from security-
dependent nations, or to be the financial center from which the nations in question
borrow funds. This leverage results in the anchor country having its own-currency-
denominated debt held as foreign reserves by the security-dependent economy. 42

       Interstate violence can also function as a tax on international trade. Blomberg
and Hess (2006) find that terrorism, together with internal and external conflicts,
place an effective 30% tariff on trade. 43 Glick and Taylor (2010) find large and

40
   The effect of trade on currency shares was positive but not statistically significant using the
alternative data sources in question.
41
   See Gibler (2009) on the coding of formal alliances among states in the Correlates of War data base.
Defense pacts are international agreements where the signatories promise to support each other
militarily against a specific threat. A non-aggression treaty is an agreement between countries not to
attack each other for a specified period of time. A neutrality treaty foresees that signatories observe
neutrality if one of them is attacked. An entente is a friendly understanding or informal alliance
between states.
42
   That the euro area cannot at present compete with the U.S. or China in terms of “hard power” is seen
by some observers (e.g. Moss 2009) as weighing on the euro’s international role.
43
   They use a panel data set with annual observations on 177 countries from 1968 to 1999. This is
larger than estimated tariff-equivalent costs of border and language barriers and tariff-equivalent
reduction through generalized systems of preference and WTO participation.



                                                                                                             14
persistent impacts of wars on trade, national income, and global economic welfare. 44
Insofar as war is a tax on trade, formal military alliances that aim at containing
violence between signatory nations and fostering cooperation against external threats
can stimulate trade in goods and finance. This, in turn, helps to nudge reserve holders
toward the unit of issuers which are members of the same alliance. 45

        If geopolitical considerations dominate, then we would expect the coefficient
on alliance to be positive and significant and the coefficients on economic size,
credibility and transaction cost dummies to be statistically insignificant. Our test of
the “Mars” vs. “Mercury” hypothesis hence is:


                                   𝐻𝐻0 : 𝛽𝛽5 ≤ 0, ∀𝑘𝑘 ∈ [1,4], 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 ≠ 0


where rejecting 𝐻𝐻0 is evidence for the Mars hypothesis against the Mercury hypothesis.


        Table 4 reports OLS estimates of Eq. (2) with standard errors that are robust to
heteroskedasticity and clustered by dyad. The results in columns (5) to (8),
controlling for transaction costs, support the Mercury hypothesis against the Mars
hypothesis. The estimated coefficients on inertia, contiguity, common colonial
relationship and distance are similar to the basic estimates of Table 2. 46 The
estimated coefficients on military alliances and its subcategories (defense pacts,
neutrality treaties, ententes) are positive, in line with the Mars hypothesis, but
typically not statistically significant. 47



                                         [Table 4 about here]




44
   According to the authors, these may be at least as large as the conventionally measured direct costs
of war, such as lost human capital.
45
   Of course, trade and military alliances can be endogenous. Causality could flow in the other
direction, too, with trade influencing security considerations. We will address this possibility below.
46
   If we do not control for transaction costs, as in columns (1) to (4), only the coefficients on inertia and
on the neutrality treaty dummy are positive and statistically significant. The non-aggression treaty
dummy drops out from the regression due to multicollinearity.
47
   The exception is the coefficient on the neutrality dummy, which is positive and statistically
significant. The coefficient on the entente dummy is slightly negative, albeit statistically insignificant,
when we control for transaction costs as in column (8) of Table 4.



                                                                                                          15
6.       Instrumental Variable Estimates

When estimating Equation (2) we face endogeneity and measurement error problems,
however. Causality between currency shares and alliances can run both ways. 48
Omitted variables could influence both currency shares and military alliances
simultaneously. The bias may come, for instance, from the fact that some countries
hold a small portion of their reserves in a particular unit because of cultural, historical
or still other reasons that we cannot fully capture, while also being part of an alliance
with the issuer. 49 Finally, measurement errors on currency shares may arise because
of e.g. changes in reporting practices or in availability of data on reserve assets. If
errors are correlated with the explanatory variables, the OLS estimate of β5 will be
biased and inconsistent. 50

       We seek to mitigate endogeneity and measurement error problems by
obtaining instrumental-variable estimates based on the cross-sectional dimension of
the sample. We modify equation (3) to the form:


                           sizei      credibilityi                                                     (3)
        sharei , j = γ 1          +γ2               + γ′3 X i, j + γ 4 alliancei , j + α j + +ui , j
                           size j     credibility j


where observations for dyad (i, j) are now period averages over 1890-1913. Our
instrument for alliance is diplomatic representation, i.e. the presence and rank of
diplomats from a sending nation in the host nation. The presence of diplomats
plausibly helps to forge or sustain international agreements and will therefore be
positively correlated with alliance. At the same time, diplomatic representation is
unlikely to be correlated with currency shares for other reasons. 51 Governments send
or accredit diplomats based on broad foreign policy considerations, not to directly
affect the currency composition of foreign reserve holdings. Expulsions or
withdrawals of diplomats typically occur because of foreign policy incidents, not to
otherwise influence the currency composition of foreign exchange holdings. This
instrument plausibly satisfies the exclusion restriction, in other words. 52




48
   There may be an upward bias in the OLS estimate of β5 if forging an alliance encourages official
investment in the unit of the reserve currency issuer that is part of the alliance in question, while at the
same time the official investments make the alliance in turn more solid.
49
   There should be in this case a downward bias in the OLS estimate of β5.
50
   If the errors are not correlated with the independent variable, the OLS estimate of β5 will be unbiased
and consistent but inefficient.
51
   The simple correlation coefficient between alliance and diplomatic representation is positive and
stands at almost 0.5 excluding colonies, as against 0.2 including colonies.
52
   The first-stage regressions will also include pecuniary factors as instruments, i.e. economic size,
contiguity and distance which, as political scientists posit, are correlated with power and proximity and,
in turn, with military alliance formation (see e.g. Walt 1985).



                                                                                                         16
        We take data on diplomatic representation from the Correlates of War project.
This variable is a linearly increasing function of the level of diplomatic representation.
It equals 0 if there is no presence of diplomats of country i in country j (and vice-
versa); 1 if a chargé d’affaires of country i is present in country j (and vice-versa); 2 if
there is a minister; 3 if there is an ambassador; and 4 if country i is a colony of
country j (and vice-versa) implying that they cannot send or host diplomats in the
traditional sense. 53

       These data are available at 5-year intervals. This implies that we lose quite a
number of observations from our original sample. The data are also highly persistent
and offer limited heterogeneity in the time series dimension; presence and rank of
diplomatic representation does not change quickly. 54 We therefore average out the
dyadic observations over time. Assuming that the mean of the measurement errors in
the dependent variable is zero, this helps to mitigate biases arising from the
measurement errors in question.

       We include currency fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity,
leaving us with 38 degrees of freedom insofar as we have a sample of 50 observations
and no fewer than 12 coefficients to estimate. Controlling for country fixed effects
would reduce estimation efficiency more significantly still, as we would be left with
only 23 degrees of freedom.

        The estimates in columns 1 to 5 of Table 5 are obtained by OLS, while those
in columns 6 to 10 are obtained by two-stage least squares using diplomatic
representation as an instrument. Standard errors are again robust to
heteroscedasticity. Pecuniary factors such as economic size and transaction costs (e.g.
contiguity and common colonial relationship) still matter, in line with the Mercury
hypothesis (columns 6 to 10 of Table 5). 55 In addition, non-pecuniary motives have
positive effects and are significant at the 12% level. 56

       Formal tests suggest that diplomatic representation is a valid instrument. The
Kleinberger-Paap test of underidentification is rejected at the 10% level of
confidence, confirming that diplomatic represention is correlated with the endogenous

53
   For instance, Britain was represented by a Viceroy in India, and there was an India Office in the U.K.
to oversee the administration of the provinces of British India. A chargé d’affaires is a head of mission
accredited by his country’s foreign minister to the receiving nation’s foreign minister when the two
nations have not agreed to exchange ambassadors. A Minister is a head of mission accredited to the
receiving country’s head of state; he leads a legation rather than an embassy. An ambassador is a head
of mission accredited to the receiving country’s head of state who heads an embassy in the receiving
country’s capital city.
54
   A simple AR(1) model of the diplomatic-representation variable gives an autoregressive root on the
order of 0.95.
55
   Other pecuniary factors have statistically insignificant effects, in contrast.
56
   While this is lower than conventional significance levels, readers should keep in mind that we have
only 38 degrees of freedom, which weighs on efficiency.



                                                                                                      17
regressor. 57 The Hansen test of overidentifying restrictions is not rejected, suggesting
that our instrument is uncorrelated with the error term.

        Mars effects are economically large. According to the IV estimates, military
alliances boost the share of international units in foreign reserve holdings by 30
percentage points (see column 6 of Table 5). This is not far from the 35 percentage
point difference in dollar shares between the nuclear-weapon states and states
dependent on the U.S. for their security and integrity of Figure 1.

                                         [Table 5 about here]

        Another concern is reverse causality between trade and diplomatic
representation. It has been argued for the modern era that foreign embassies and
consulates have lost importance for foreign policy and intelligence gathering and
increasingly market themselves as agents of export promotion (see e.g. Rose 2007). If
diplomatic representation was motivated by trade-promotion goals, which would
determine the direction of trade and, in turn, currency shares, results will be biased.

         To address this issue, we calculate the residuals from a regression of
diplomatic presence and rank as of 1884 (i.e. prior to the beginning of our sample) on
distance, relative GDP, contiguity, common language and common colonial
relationship, the standard arguments of the gravity model. This provides us with a
measure of diplomatic representation that is both predetermined and orthogonal with
respect to trade frictions, including trade potential, insofar as the latter is captured by
the frictions in question. The results using this measure, in Table 6, are the same as in
Table 5. 58

                                         [Table 6 about here]

       Figure 5 shows the predicted shares of selected reserve currencies in the
foreign reserve holdings of five countries that signed defense pacts with the issuer of
those currencies prior to World War I. Predicted shares are computed using the full
model estimates in Table 5, column (7), i.e. including the effects of defense pacts
(shown as dark grey bars) and, alternatively, excluding the effects of defense pacts
(shown as light grey bars). Actual currency shares are shown as black bars.

        Consider the case of Japan, which is shown in the middle of Figure 4. The
actual share of sterling in Japan’s foreign reserve holdings prior to World War I was
96%. The predicted share in a model including only pecuniary factors is much lower,

57
   The power of the instrument is low, however, insofar as the F-statistic of the first-stage regression is
below the rule-of-thumb value of 10 or the critical values tabulated by Stock and Yogo (2005).
58
   One reason for this is that diplomatic representation in our 1890-1913 was very similar to that in
1884. It was decided beforehand and, insofar as we removed trade considerations, by broad
geopolitical motives. This suggests that trade promotion goals are unimportant for our results.



                                                                                                         18
at 36%. That Japan signed a defense pact with the United Kingdom in 1902 to oppose
Russia’s expansion in Asia goes a long way toward explaining the difference. The
predicted share including defense-pact effects is 88%, much closer to the actual share.
Defense pacts similarly explain much of the gap between actual and predicted shares
of the Reichsmark and French franc for Austria-Hungary, Italy, Romania and Russia.

        In the absence of Mars effects, our equation under-predicts currency shares in
countries with defense pacts. As Figure 6 makes clear, the forecast error for the
countries in question is negative. But under-prediction is not a systematic feature of a
model without Mars effects. Such a model, in contrast, tends to over-predict currency
shares (the forecast error is positive for over 60% of the observations shown in the
figure). This is additional evidence that the reserve allocation of countries with
defense pacts is different from other countries.


        Figure 7 illustrates the point with reference five countries that depend on the
US for their security (Germany, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan) using our
estimate of the geopolitical premium obtained for the earlier era. The importance of
geopolitical factors in reserve currency choice is again readily apparent now, just as
before. 59 The figure makes clear that the Mars hypothesis goes a long way toward
explaining the dominance of the US dollar in global reserves in the modern era, too.

                                 [Figures 5, 6 and 7 about here]



7.      Scenario Analysis


Given these findings, what would be the impact on US bond markets of a scenario in
which the U.S. is no longer be seen as a predictable guarantor of the security of its
allies? Table 7 gives a sense of the impact by contrasting the share of the US dollar in
the reserves of nuclear-weapon states, on the one hand, and states dependent on the
U.S. for their geopolitical security, on the other hand. 60 It assumes that the dollar’s
security premium disappears, in other words. It also assumes that that the level of
reserves held globally remains unchanged. The result is a 30 percentage-point
reduction in the share of the U.S. unit in the reserves of U.S.-dependent states, and an
increase the share of other reserve units such as the euro, yen and renminbi (see
column 6 of Table 7).

59
   Credibility for the modern era is measured with sovereign debt ratings (instead of years in the gold
standard). Ratings are converted into a numeric variable using a linear scale, which has the same
standard deviation across countries as the credibility variable for the earlier era.
60
   The table does not report nuclear-weapon states of which the currency composition of foreign
exchange reserves is not known, such as Pakistan and North Korea, or which no longer possess nuclear
weapons, such as South Africa. The table does not report major non-N.A.T.O. U.S. allies with reserve
holdings below $200 billion, such as Thailand, Poland, Egypt or Australia, with the exception of
Germany.



                                                                                                    19
       The dollar assets liquidated in this scenario, as shown in column (7), total
more than $750 billion. This is equivalent to about 5% of the stock of U.S.
marketable public debt, or about 4% of U.S. GDP. 61 U.S. disengagement would thus
have significant effects on bond markets. Adopting the elasticity estimate of Warnock
and Warnock (2009), according to which 12-month foreign flows of 1 percent of U.S.
GDP are associated with a 19 basis point reduction in US long-term interest rates, it
would raise long-term U.S. interest rates by roughly 80 basis points. With public debt
at more than $14 trillion end-2016, this would translate into roughly $115 billion in
additional interest rate payments per annum. These benefits need to be compared
with the costs of supporting the U.S.’s military presence overseas. One official
estimate put these at $10 billion per year, some 70% of which being spent in
Germany, Korea, and Japan (U.S. Senate 2013). One independent estimate is higher,
at $100 billion per year (Vine 2015). Either way, US foreign involvement remains
beneficial insofar as the geopolitical premium earned on the U.S. dollar is higher still.

        The rise in U.S. long-term interest rates, in turn, would lead to depreciation of
the U.S. dollar of almost 5% after ten years, given the coefficient estimate of 0.6 on
interest rate differentials obtained by Chinn and Meredith (2004) in long-horizon
uncovered interest parity regressions. 62

                                      [Table 7 about here]

        What if the level of foreign reserves changes when the US withdraws from the
world? If the world becomes a riskier place, countries may choose to increase their
reserves holdings. Table 8 considers alternative scenarios where it is assumed both
that the U.S. dollar loses its security premium and that the level of reserves held by
states dependent on the U.S. for their geopolitical security rises by up to 30%. Two
opposing effects now need to be considered. On the one hand, dollars need to be sold
because their share in the reserves of U.S.-dependent states falls. On the other hand,
dollars need to be purchased because countries increase their overall reserve holdings.

        The net effect is shown in Table 8. Plausibly, the more that U.S.-dependent
states increase their reserve holdings, the less they liquidate dollars, and the less is the
impact on U.S. bond yields and the dollar exchange rate. Figure 8 shows that the
impact in question declines linearly with the increase in the level of reserves assumed.
That said, it remains economically large. Assuming an increase in the level of
reserves of 30%, which is sizeable, US long-term interest rates would still increase by
more than 30 basis points.

                              [Table 8 and Figure 8 about here]

61
  The former stands at $14.4 trillion, against $18.6 trillion for the latter.
62
  The estimate is obtained with 10-year benchmark government bond yields on a panel of observations
for 5 major exchange rates against the U.S. dollar over the period 1987-2000. Updated estimates in
Chinn and Quayyum (2013) are similar.



                                                                                                20
8.     Conclusion

We have assessed the importance of pecuniary and geopolitical motives in
international currency choice using data on foreign exchange reserves prior to World
War I. Our results provide evidence of both motives. Specifically, they suggest that
military alliances boost the share of international units in foreign exchange reserve
holdings by almost 30 percentage points.

        Currently, the dollar’s dominance as an international unit is supported, in part,
by America’s status as a global power, one that helps to guarantee the security of its
allies. Our findings speak to current discussions on the future of the international
monetary system, amidst concerns about possible American disengagement from the
global geopolitics in favor of a more U.S.-first, isolationist role. If this status came
to be seen as less predictable and secure, our results suggest that long-term U.S.
interest rates would increase by as much as 80 basis points, according to our
estimates.

        Our findings also imply that China’s growing self-confidence and
assertiveness on the international stage could help to support the emergence of the
renminbi as an increasingly important international unit. And they suggest that deeper
European cooperation in certain domains, such as external security and defense, might
not be irrelevant for the euro’s global standing.

Note: The figure plots publicly available estimates of the share of the US dollar in the foreign exchange
reserves of nuclear-weapon states (dark grey dot) and US-dependent states for security (light grey
diamond) against the share of the US in the trade in goods (exports and imports) of the countries in
question (see Table A1 for details and data sources). GB: United Kingdom (estimate for 2004); RU:

Note: The figure shows for 1899 and 1913 the global stock of foreign exchange reserves broken down
by currency. Reserves held by the Canadian chartered banks are not included to be consistent with the
data reported in Lindert (1969). Currency shares are calculated at market exchange rates.

19 countries (in % and at market exchange rates). Data are linearly interpolated between missing observations for ease of reading. The currency breakdown for South
Africa is not available owing to lack of data for currencies other than sterling.

Note: The figure shows the predicted shares of selected reserve currencies in the foreign reserve holdings of five
countries which had signed a defense pact with the issuer of the currencies in question prior to World War I.
Predicted shares are computed under two scenarios: (i) using the full model estimates reported in Table 5, column
(7), i.e. including the effects of defense pacts (shown as dark grey bars); (ii) excluding the effects of defense pacts
(shown as light grey bars). Actual currency shares are shown as black bars.

Note: The figure shows the predicted shares of the US dollar in the foreign reserve holdings of five countries
which depend on the US for their security now. Predicted shares are computed under two scenarios: (i) using the
full model estimates reported in Table 5, column (6), i.e. including the effects of military alliances (shown as dark
grey bars); (ii) excluding the effects of military alliances (shown as light grey bars). Actual currency shares are
shown as black bars. Credibility effects are measured using sovereign debt ratings.

assume that the U.S. withdraws from the world and the U.S. dollar loses its geopolitical/security premium, hence

leading to a change in the composition of global foreign exchange reserves. The scenarios further assume that the
level of the reserves in question increases by up to 30%. The top left-hand side chart shows the estimated amount
of US dollars to be liquidated conditional on the hypothesized increase in global foreign exchange reserves. The
top right-hand side chart shows the estimated impact on long-term US interest rates conditional on the
hypothesized increase in global foreign exchange reserves. The bottom left-hand side chart shows the estimated
US dollar depreciation conditional on the hypothesized increase in global foreign exchange reserves.

Note: The table reports OLS estimates of Eq. (2) obtained by OLS based on our sample of 68 dyads (19 countries/5
reserve currencies) over the period 1890-1913. The estimates include key pecuniary determinants of international
reserve currency status and dummy variables which equal 1 for formal alliances, defense pacts, neutrality treaties
and ententes, respectively, for dyad i, j in year t and 0 otherwise. The estimates control for currency fixed effects,
country fixed effects and time effects. The standard errors reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity

Note: The table reports cross-sectional estimates of Eq. (3); those in columns (1) to (5) are obtained by OLS while those in columns (6) to (10) are obtained by two-
stage least squares using as instrument diplomatic representation at the level of chargé d’affaires, minister, and ambassador between states. Each cross-sectional unit
represents a country/reserve currency dyad with time series observations averaged out over the period 1890-1913. The estimates control for currency fixed effects.
The standard errors reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0 .1, + p<0.15.

Note: The table reports estimates of the impact on bond markets of hypothetical scenarios which assume that the U.S. withdraws from the world and the U.S. dollar
loses its geopolitical premium, hence leading to a change in the composition of global foreign exchange reserves away from the dollar towards other units like the
euro, yen or Chinese renminbi. NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is a mutual defense pact established in 1949 that consists of 29 member states,
including the U.S. Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty foresees that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it should be considered an attack
against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary. Major non-NATO allies have strategic working relationships
with U.S. armed forces but are not NATO members.

Note: The table reports estimates of the impact on bond markets of hypothetical scenarios which assume that the U.S. withdraws from the world and the U.S. dollar
loses its geopolitical premium, hence leading to a change in the composition of global foreign exchange reserves. The scenarios further assume that the level of the
reserves in question increases by up to 30%.

Note: The table reports OLS estimates of Eq. (1) based on our sample of 73 dyads (19 countries/5 reserve
currencies) over the period 1890-1913 including key pecuniary determinants of international reserve currency
status (inertia, credibility, economic size, trade relations and financial depth) dyadic effects and time effects. The
dependent variable is currency share adjusted for gold holdings. The standard errors reported in parentheses are
robust to heteroskedasticity and clustered by dyad; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0 .1, + p<0.15.
