                                         ABSTRACT

For more than 80 years, many macroeconomic analyses have been premised on the assumption
that workers’ nominal wage rates cannot be cut. The U.S. evidence on this assumption has been
inconclusive because of distortions from reporting error in household surveys. Following a
British literature, we reconsider the issue with more accurate wage data from the payroll records
of most employers in the State of Washington over the period 2005-2015. For every one of the
40 four-quarters-apart periods for which we observe year-to-year wage changes, we find that at
least 20 percent of job stayers experience nominal wage reductions.

                   How Prevalent Is Downward Rigidity in Nominal Wages?
                      Evidence from Payroll Records in Washington State


“If, when we investigate something, we find there is reason and proof for it, we must acknowledge
that as reality – even if it is in contradiction with a literal scriptural explanation that has held sway
for many centuries or with a deeply held opinion or view. So one fundamental attitude shared by
Buddhism and science is the commitment to keep searching for reality by empirical means and to
be willing to disregard accepted or long-held positions if our search finds the truth is different.”
                                                        – The Dalai Lama (2006, pp. 24-5)


                                            1 .Introduction
        In chapter 2 of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), John
Maynard Keynes set out the labor-market premise of his macroeconomic model – that the reason
the labor market does not clear in a recession, but instead exhibits high unemployment, is that
workers refuse to accept reductions in their nominal wages. In the 80-plus years since publication
of The General Theory, Keynes’s premise of downward nominal wage rigidity has continued to
be highly influential in macroeconomic analysis. A couple of prominent examples from decades
ago are Tobin’s (1972) presidential address to the American Economic Association and the 1996
Brookings Papers article by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry. Both of these much-cited articles
restated and extended Keynes’s analysis and advocated for positive inflation as a device to “grease
the wheels of the labor market.”
        Quite understandably, attention to Keynes’s analysis increased during the Great Recession.
For example, according to Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe’s (2013) article “Downward Nominal Wage
Rigidity and the Case for Temporary Inflation in the Eurozone” in the Journal of Economic
Perspectives, “downward nominal wage rigidity played an important role in the current
unemployment crisis in the euro area.” A widely noticed San Francisco Fed note by Daly, Hobijn,
and Lucking (2012) reached a similar conclusion for the United States. Based partly on the work
of Daly et al., Paul Krugman repeatedly blogged about the crucial role of downward nominal wage
rigidity. His July 22, 2012, entry (“Sticky Wages and the Macro Story”) argued that “downward
nominal wage rigidity … is a glaringly obvious feature of the real world…. It’s simply a fact that
actual cuts in nominal wages happen only rarely and under great pressure.” In the aftermath of the

                                                   1
Great Recession, prominent macroeconomic analyses have continued to rely on the assumption of
downward nominal wage rigidity. A couple of particularly recent examples are Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe (2016) and Dupraz, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2018).
       After more than 80 years of such analyses, the question we wish to pose is: What is the
evidence for the proposition that downward nominal wage rigidity is a binding constraint, so much
so that it can account for major allocative inefficiencies in real quantities such as employment and
unemployment? To be clear, we do not mean to deny the existence of any nominal wage stickiness.
We expect that most of our readers, like ourselves, have their salaries set in nominal terms and
typically see them adjusted only once a year. But does it follow that nominal wages cannot be cut,
even when layoffs into unemployment are the alternative?
       Given the long history of downward nominal wage rigidity as a premise of macroeconomic
theorizing, it is surprising that the evidence on this question is as weak as it is. As we will discuss
in the next section, until recently most of the evidence came from U.S. studies based on wage
reports in longitudinal household surveys. Two key findings in these studies have been (a) that
many workers staying with the same employer report the same nominal base wage in successive
years, but (b) that many other job stayers report nominal wage cuts. The first finding is suggestive
of wage rigidity; the second is suggestive of wage flexibility. Both findings reasonably have been
questioned on the ground that they could be artifacts of the considerable reporting error in
household surveys.
       In sections 3 and 4, we will revisit the question with the benefit of more accurate and
comprehensive data drawn from the payroll records of most employers in the State of Washington
over the period 2005-2015. Like a British literature we will review in section 2, the new
Washington evidence shows that nominal wage freezes are much less common than they appear
in household survey reports, but nominal wage cuts occur with strikingly high frequency. Section
5 will provide a summary and discussion.


                               2. The Existing Empirical Literature
       Most of the existing U.S. evidence on nominal wage rigidity has come from longitudinal
analyses of workers’ year-to-year wage changes as measured in household surveys, mainly the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey (CPS). Some of the most
influential early examples are McLaughlin (1994), Kahn (1997), and Card and Hyslop (1996).

                                                  2
Because it is obvious that job changers typically experience wage changes, these studies have
focused on the more interesting question of whether workers staying with the same employer
exhibit sticky nominal wages.
        A sense of the main findings is provided in figure 1, which reproduces figure 4 from the
CPS-based replication and update of the literature in Elsby, Shin, and Solon (2016). The figure
shows histograms of January-to-January changes in log nominal base wages for workers paid by
the hour in 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012. 1 The thin spike at zero tells the
percentage of workers who reported the exact same wage in both years. The next bin to the right
contains workers whose change in log nominal wage was positive but no greater than 0.02; the
next bin contains those whose change in log nominal wage was greater than 0.02 and less than or
equal to 0.04; and so forth. The bins to the left of zero are constructed symmetrically. For the
sake of readability, workers with changes in log nominal wage greater than 0.64 are piled up in
the rightmost bin and those with changes less than -0.34 in the leftmost bin.
        Many of the exhibited patterns will be discussed in section 3, when we present histograms
from our payroll-based Washington State data. For now, we emphasize three patterns commonly
observed in the literature based on household surveys. First, as expected, most job stayers show
positive nominal wage growth. This is necessary just to keep up with positive inflation, and
nominal wage growth greater than the inflation rate frequently occurs to deliver the real wage
growth associated with human capital enhancement and other factors. Second, the spikes at zero
nominal wage growth are substantial. In the years shown in figure 1, the percentage of hourly job
stayers reporting zero wage change is regularly between 15 and 20 percent, a finding that seems
to suggest nominal wage stickiness. On the other hand, a third pattern is that many cases are
located to the left of zero. In the years shown in the figure, the percentage of hourly job stayers
reporting nominal wage cuts ranges from 17.0 to 25.5 percent. Taken at face value, this finding
seems to contradict the assumption that nominal wages cannot be cut.
        But it is not clear that either the second or third finding should be taken at face value. As
many writers have noted, either finding could be largely an artifact of reporting error. Starting
with the third finding, Altonji and Devereux (1999) and Akerlof et al. (1996), among others, have
speculated that nominal wage cuts really are rare and that the many reports of negative changes


1
 Some of these histograms are slightly in error because of a coding mistake that excluded never-married workers.
Eck (2018) discovered the error and found that correcting it made very little difference for the results.

                                                       3
mostly reflect instances in which the second year’s reporting error is sufficiently negative relative
to the first year’s. At the same time, the large spikes at zero could be partly an artifact of rounding
error. For example, if a worker whose true nominal hourly base wages were $19.80 last year and
$20.30 this year reports a wage of $20 in both years, she would appear in the histogram as a wage
freeze case even though her nominal wage actually grew by almost 3 percent. 2 In addition, it is
possible that many of the measured freezes in base pay overlook variation in other types of pay,
such as bonuses and commissions.
        Of course, the most compelling solution to ambiguities from measurement error is to look
at more accurate data. This is exactly the approach taken in part of the British literature. In a
pioneering study, Smith (2000) first used the 1991-1996 waves of the British Household Panel
Study (BHPS) to verify that she got results similar to those based on U.S. household surveys. Then
she exploited a remarkable feature of the BHPS: respondents were told they could consult their
pay slips when answering the wage questions, and the survey recorded who did so. When Smith
restricted her analysis to the sub-sample that did check their pay slips, the spike at zero nominal
wage change became much smaller. Smith concluded that the spike had been exaggerated on
account of rounding error. Even more interestingly, she found that the pay-slip-consulting sub-
sample reported fewer wage cuts, but not by that much. Even in this group, the proportion with
negative nominal wage change was 18 percent. To quote her striking summary, “Some of the
results in this paper may seem difficult to believe – the quite common occurrence of nominal pay
cuts, for example. It may well be that the difficulty in believing them stems not from the weight
of contradictory evidence, but rather from conventional wisdom that has survived because of the
previous lack of evidence either way.”
        Smith’s study was followed by Nickell and Quintini’s (2003) study based on 1975-1999
data from the New Earnings Survey (NES). The NES sample is a 1 percent sample of income tax-
paying workers, but the survey is administered to employers, who are legally required to report
wage information from their payroll records for a reference week each April. Nickell and
Quintini’s first use of these relatively accurate wage data was to verify that they produced 1991-
1996 results similar to Smith’s for the BHPS respondents that checked their pay slips. Nickell and

2
  Both Kahn (1997) and Card and Hyslop (1996) report that many of their measured wage freezes occur at round
numbers. Both correctly observe that, with the household survey data alone, it is difficult to tell whether that
pattern reflects rounding error or a genuine tendency of some employers to pay a round-number wage and stick to
it until circumstances impel them to jump the wage to a different round number.

                                                       4
Quintini went on to an analysis for their full 1975-1999 period, which continued to show a smaller
spike at zero than usually found in household surveys as well as substantial numbers of nominal
wage cuts. Elsby, Shin, and Solon (2016) conducted a replication of Nickell and Quintini and an
update through the year 2012. Their table 6 shows that the zero spike ranged from a low of 0.4
percent in 1979-1980, when inflation was almost 20 percent, to a high of 9.1 percent in 2011-2012,
when inflation was moderate and unemployment was high. In the majority of years, the proportion
with frozen nominal wages was less than 3 percent. The percentage with nominal wage cuts ranged
from a low of 4.9 in 1979-1980 (when inflation was almost 20 percent) to a high of 23.5 in both
2009-2010 and 2011-2012. Most strikingly of all, over the last 20 years of the sample period, the
percentage of job stayers receiving nominal wage cuts was regularly close to 20 percent.
        What all these researchers said they learned from the data is that British nominal wages are
more flexible than was previously realized. 3 A natural question for American readers of this
research is whether relatively accurate payroll-based wage data for the United States would show
similar results. The next section addresses that question with such data from Washington State.


                                    3. Evidence from Washington State
        No U.S. data set is quite like the payroll-based NES data for Great Britain. Most state
unemployment insurance programs in the United States, however, do require employers to report
every employee’s quarterly earnings, which are needed to calculate workers’ benefit entitlements
if they become unemployed and file claims for unemployment benefits. The problem was that,
without hours data as well, it seemed impossible to measure hourly wage rates. The key
breakthrough occurred when Kurmann, McEntarfer, and Spletzer (2016) discovered that a few
states do require employers to report each employee’s quarterly hours. In most of these states, the
hours data may not be very accurate, but Washington State is an exception. Washington’s benefit
entitlement rules depend on quarterly hours as well as quarterly earnings, so Washington needs
accurate reporting of both variables. 4

  Several studies of other countries have used payroll-based or pay-slip-based data and also have found considerable
frequency of nominal wage cuts. See Elsby and Solon (2018) for a summary of studies of West Germany, Austria,
Italy, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, South Korea, Portugal, and Sweden.

  For the purpose of obtaining accurate hours data, the State of Washington requires employers to keep a record of
daily work hours for each employee for at least four years from the date when taxes were paid. In addition, the
Employment Security Department conducts annual audits of selected employers and can fine employers if they fail
to report hours worked or make regular mistakes in reporting. An analysis of the quality of the Washington hours

                                                         5
        In Washington, therefore, it is possible to measure each worker’s average hourly earnings
each quarter as the ratio of quarterly earnings to quarterly hours. 5 Unlike the NES data, which are
for only a 1 percent sample of tax-paying workers, the Washington data are nearly comprehensive.
The Washington unemployment insurance system encompasses about 95 percent of private sector
employment. It also covers state and local government workers, but excludes federal government
employees, contractors who receive 1099 instead of W-2 tax forms, corporate officers, and elected
officials. The wage measurement also is relatively comprehensive in the sense that it encompasses
all monetary compensation, including bonuses, commissions, and the like. This is reasonable for
our purposes because a reduction in average hourly earnings due to, say, a decreased bonus is
economically interpretable as a wage reduction. A more nuanced situation, to be discussed below,
is a reduction in overtime hours. In the remainder of this paper, we often will use the term “wage”
as a shorthand for the ratio of quarterly earnings to quarterly hours, acknowledging that this is
more accurately if verbosely described as a measure of average monetary compensation per hour.
        Like most of the literature, our study overlooks fringe benefits, such as employer
contributions to health insurance. Lebow, Saks, and Wilson (2003) have argued that fringe
benefits are an additional dimension for adjustment in compensation, so overlooking them is likely
to make total compensation seem less flexible than it actually is. A similar point applies to
variation in work effort.
        Following the literature’s tradition of measuring year-to-year wage changes, we study four-
quarters-apart changes in average hourly earnings. Our sample covers 40 periods, starting with
the change between the first quarters of 2005 and 2006 and ending with the change between the
fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015. The sample therefore includes periods before, during, and after
the Great Recession. Again following the literature, we focus on wage changes of workers that
stay with the same firm. 6 Thus, to contribute a wage change observation in our first sample period,
a worker had to have worked positive hours for the same employer in both the first quarter of 2005




data by Lachowska, Mas, and Woodbury (2018) concludes that “the reliability of administrative hours reporting is
high.”
5
   Employers are instructed to report “all hours worked during the quarter.” For full-time salaried and other
employees whose weekly hours are not explicitly tracked, employers are instructed to report 40 hours per week.
6
  In our analysis, a worker in a multi-establishment firm who moves from one Washington establishment to another
within the firm is classified as a stayer.

                                                       6
and the first quarter of 2006. 7 Finally, to avoid observations that seem likely to be erroneous, we
exclude observations with more than 1,000 work hours in the quarter, observations with a nominal
hourly wage greater than $500 but fewer than 10 work hours, and individuals with multiple records
with the same employer in the same quarter. These restrictions exclude less than 1 percent of the
data over our 10-year period. Still, the existence of these cases highlights that even the Washington
data are imperfect, though we expect them to be a considerable improvement over household
survey data.
         The Washington data are such a great resource that they have attracted two research teams
– ourselves and Kurmann and McEntarfer (2017). That the two concurrent projects partially
overlap is good for the sake of cross-validation. But they also differ in important respects, which
will be noted in further detail below. For now, a broad-brush characterization of the differences
is that our study concentrates on a more detailed description of year-to-year hourly wage change,
while Kurmann and McEntarfer’s analysis extends to other topics, especially earnings changes due
to hours changes 8 and the very challenging question of the extent to which downward nominal
wage rigidity causes layoffs and other allocational changes. 9
         The heart of our analysis is the plotting of histograms for job stayers’ four-quarters-apart
nominal wage growth for each of our 40 sample periods. The sample size for each of the 40 periods
is approximately two million job stayers. Our results are illustrated in figure 2, which displays
four of our histograms, for the first quarters of 2005-2006, 2008-2009, 2011-2012, and 2014-2015.
In each histogram, a thin vertical line marks the position of exactly zero nominal wage change,
and the overlaid red bar shows the relative frequency of nominal wage freezes. As in figure 1, the
next bin to the right of zero contains workers whose change in log nominal wage is positive but
no greater than 0.02; the next contains those whose change in log nominal wage is greater than
0.02 but no greater than 0.04; and so forth, with a symmetric layout to the left of zero. In figure

7
  More precisely, our unit of analysis is a worker-employer pair. A worker who works for the same two employers
in both of the two quarters thus contributes two wage change observations.
8
  This aspect of their work leads them to restrict their sample to workers staying with the same employer for at least
10 consecutive quarters, so for our purpose of studying nominal wage rate changes, their sample is smaller (about
half the size of ours per time period) and more narrowly selected.
9
  This latter analysis follows in the footsteps of Ehrlich and Montes (2014). That study and the one by Kurmann and
McEntarfer both find that firms with relatively many nominal wage freezes also tend to lay off more workers, and
both studies infer that nominal wage rigidity causes the layoffs. The identification problem is that there is an
alternative interpretation of the observed correlation – that economically distressed firms tend to have both more
wage freezes and more layoffs, even if the layoffs were not caused by wage rigidity. This alternative interpretation
is supported by the interviews of managers reported in section 11.3 of Bewley (1999).

                                                          7
2, workers with changes in log nominal wage greater than 0.40 are piled up in the rightmost bin
and those with changes less than -0.40 in the leftmost bin.
       All four histograms (as well as the 36 others we have not displayed here) show the three
typical features already mentioned in section 2: most job stayers experience positive nominal wage
growth; a noticeable spike appears at zero nominal wage change; and many stayers are measured
as receiving nominal wage cuts. As in the British literature using payroll or pay slip data, though,
the zero spike is much smaller than what typically is measured in household surveys, which are
likely subject to considerable rounding error and often overlook variation in wages other than base
pay. Also as in that British literature, the proportion receiving wage cuts is strikingly large.
       These findings are spelled out in more detail in table 1, which lists key statistics for all of
our 40 periods. The “wage cut” column shows that the percentage of Washington job stayers
receiving nominal wage reductions exceeds 20 percent in all 40 periods, with a low of 20.4 percent
between the first quarters of 2006 and 2007 and a high of 33.1 percent between the fourth quarters
of 2008 and 2009. It is no surprise that the prevalence of wage cuts rose considerably during the
Great Recession and returned to a normal (but still strikingly high) level afterwards.
       The “wage freeze” column shows that the percentage with zero wage change ranges
between a low of 2.5 percent between the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2007 and a high of 7.7
percent between the second quarters of 2009 and 2010. It is no surprise that the prevalence of
wage freezes also rose considerably during the Great Recession. But it may surprise many readers
that, once wages are measured more accurately with payroll-based data, the frequency of wage
freezes turns out to be so low. The percentage is always below 8 percent and in the majority of
our sample periods is less than 4 percent. Echoing the British literature based on payroll or pay
slip data, these zero spikes are much smaller than those measured in household survey data that
are subject to rounding error and exclude compensation beyond base pay.
       The zero spikes reported for Washington by Kurmann and McEntarfer (2017) also are
smaller than those from household surveys, but are larger than ours. The main reason for the
apparent discrepancy between the two Washington studies is that Kurmann and McEntarfer’s zero
spikes include not only the exact zeros, but also log wage changes of no more than 0.005 in
magnitude. In our view, very small wage changes are economically interesting and should be
distinguished from the exact zeros. Indeed, the last two columns of our table 1 display log nominal
wage reductions and log nominal wage increases of no more than 0.01. As shown for the British

                                                  8
NES data in table 6 of Elsby, Shin, and Solon (2016), these small wage changes occur with non-
trivial frequency. The percentage of Washington stayers experiencing log wage changes no greater
in magnitude than 0.01 exceeds 7 percent in every one of our 40 sample periods and usually
exceeds 10 percent. Some previous studies based on household surveys (e.g., Kahn, 1997) have
claimed to see “holes” in the wage growth distribution near zero and have attributed these holes to
menu-cost reasons for employers to avoid small wage changes. But our histograms and the last
two columns of table 1 show no such holes. Of course, the same rounding error that overstates the
frequency of wage freezes in household survey data also understates the frequency of small wage
changes.
         Some data sets distinguish base pay from other wage components, 10 but such a separation
is not possible with the Washington data. We therefore cannot determine what proportion of our
measured wage cuts are due, for example, to reductions in bonuses or commissions. In any case,
such cuts are properly viewed as a sort of wage flexibility. In contrast, the economic interpretation
of a measured wage cut is less clear when it arises from a reduction in the share of a worker’s
quarterly hours that are overtime work paid at time-and-a-half. If the worker welcomed the
overtime work and regrets the reduction, it makes economic sense to say that the worker’s
compensation was reduced. On the other hand, if the worker experienced the old overtime share
as burdensome and is glad for the reduction, it would be a mistake to say that the worker’s
compensation was cut. What little evidence exists on this issue (see chapter 7 in Ehrenberg and
Schumann, 1982) does not point clearly in one direction or the other.
         Although we cannot isolate overtime pay and hours, we can analyze a sub-sample of
workers for whom overtime is not a likely factor. Table 2 redoes the key analyses in table 1, but
for a sub-sample of job stayers satisfying two restrictions: (a) their quarterly hours are between
480 and 560 in both of the quarters involved in the measurement of wage change, and (b) they
have positive earnings or hours with the same employer in the quarters both preceding and


10
   For example, the British NES obtains earnings and hours variables that explicitly exclude overtime. Also, a new
preliminary manuscript by Grigsby, Hurst, and Yildermaz (2018) uses U.S. data from the ADP payroll processing
company that provide some basis for separating base pay from other wages. The authors find that base pay
reductions are rare in expansion years, but they replicate our finding that reductions in overall earnings per hour are
strikingly common. This finding regarding the role of compensation other than base pay in nominal wage changes
echoes a familiar result from the literature on cyclicality in real wages. For example, the last two sentences in Shin
and Solon (2007) conclude, “Even among workers staying with the same employer, though, real average hourly
earnings appear to be substantially procyclical. An important part of that procyclicality probably is due to
compensation beyond base wages, such as overtime pay and bonuses.”

following both of the quarters involved in the measurement of wage change. This group is
approximately 30 percent of our full sample. Of course, it is possible for some cases with overtime
work to creep into this sub-sample, but we conjecture that the large majority of these workers
worked 40 hours in every paid week of each quarter. 11 The results show that some combination
of lack of overtime and the particularly stable employment of this sub-sample leads to a somewhat
higher frequency of wage freezes and lower frequency of wage cuts, as compared to the full sample
in table 1. Even for this sub-sample, though, the frequency of nominal wage cuts remains striking.
The percentage with wage cuts ranges from a low of 14.5 percent between the third quarters of
2006 and 2007 to a high of 31.8 percent between the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2009. In most of
our sample periods, the percentage with wage cuts is fairly close to 20 percent.


                                       4. Some Intriguing Details
        Footnote 16 in Elsby, Shin, and Solon (2016) reports on sectoral disaggregations of the
British NES data and concludes that “nominal wage cuts are remarkably pervasive across sub-
groups of workers/jobs.” We similarly have disaggregated the Washington data by industry and
firm size. Appendix table 1 shows each sample period’s percentages of job stayers with nominal
wage cuts in two industries. The utilities industry is the one with the chronically lowest percentage
of wage cuts, and the mining and oil and gas extraction industry is the one with the chronically
highest, so the two give a good sense of the range across industries. Even in the utilities industry,
the percentage with nominal wage cuts ranges from a low of 13.8 percent between the first quarters
of 2005 and 2006 to a high of 29.3 percent between the first quarters of 2007 and 2008. With only
two exceptions, it is above 15 percent in every period.
        We also have disaggregated our sample into six firm-size categories (measured as of the
first of the two quarters used in measuring wage change): 1-9 employees; 10-49; 50-99; 100-499;
500-9,999; and 10,000 or more. Again we have found that nominal wage cuts are pervasive. In
each of the first five categories, the percentage of job stayers receiving wages cuts tracks very
closely with the overall numbers in table 1. The series for the firms with at least 10,000 employees




11
  We use the 480-560 range because the target population need not have been paid for exactly 13 weeks in the
quarter. For example, many employers use bi-weekly pay periods, in which case the workers’ quarterly earnings
would be for either 12 or 14 weeks.

                                                     10
is more volatile because it involves fewer firms, but its central tendency is only a little below that
for the full sample.
        If 20 percent of all the job stayers in a particular period show wage cuts, this could happen
because 20 percent of the stayers in every firm receive wage cuts. Or it could happen because the
cuts occur universally in firms that employ 20 percent of stayers, and not at all in other firms.
Where between these extremes does the reality lie? To explore this question, we create for each
job stayer receiving a wage cut the following variable – the percentage of that worker’s job-staying
co-workers that also received a wage cut in the same period. Then, in each of our 40 sample
periods, we plot the histogram of the distribution of that variable. Figure 3 shows the histograms
for the first quarters of 2005-2006, 2008-2009, 2011-2012, and 2014-2015. All the histograms
(including the 36 not shown in figure 3) indicate that, in every period, the majority of job stayers
receiving nominal wage cuts work for firms that cut the wages of between 10 and 50 percent of
their job stayers.
        This finding that wage-cutting firms tend to target the cuts on a subset of their employees
echoes a small anecdotal literature (Bewley, 1999; Blinder and Choi, 1990). For example, on
pages 199-200 in his chapter 12 (“Experiences with Pay Reduction”), Bewley reported, “Some
companies did cut or freeze the pay of groups of employees whose pay was felt to be excessive….
These cuts usually occurred in newly acquired companies or resulted from a tightening of control
over local management, and they were triggered by financial problems or increased product market
competition.” The quotations that followed, along with some near the end of chapter 5, also noted
a tendency, when responding to financial problems, to concentrate pay cuts on workers in
management positions.
        This latter point motivated us to investigate where wage cuts are concentrated in within-
firm wage distributions. For this analysis, we focus on job stayers experiencing wage cuts in firms
that have at least 20 stayers that period and that cut wages for less than 100 percent of those stayers.
Next we split each firm’s stayers into quartiles with respect to their wages in the first of the two
quarters involved in the measured wage change. Finally, for each of our 40 sample periods, we
plot a histogram for where the stayers receiving wage cuts lie in that within-firm wage distribution.
Appendix figure 1 shows the histograms for the first quarters of 2005-2006, 2008-2009, 2011-
2012, and 2014-2015. If there were no association between receiving a wage cut and prior position
in the within-firm wage distribution, each of the four quartile bins would contain 25 percent of the

                                                  11
cases. Instead, all the histograms (including the 36 not shown) display a tendency for the cuts to
be more concentrated in higher quartiles of the within-firm wage distribution. In every one of our
40 sample periods, the percentage of stayers receiving cuts that were in the top half of their within-
firm wage distribution is between 60 and 70 percent. This is quite similar to a finding for South
Korea reported in Park and Shin (2017).
       We think that all these detailed findings are interesting, and some warrant further research.
But we wish now to step back from the trees and gaze at the forest. Our big-picture finding is that
the payroll-based wage information from Washington State, like earlier evidence from Great
Britain, shows that nominal wage cuts for job stayers are much more common than most of us
previously believed.


                                   5. Summary and Discussion
       For over 80 years, many macroeconomists have based their models on an assumption that
workers’ nominal wage rates cannot be cut. Seemingly contrary evidence from household surveys
reasonably has been dismissed on the ground that it could reflect rampant response error. Like a
British literature that moved from household surveys to presumably more accurate information
from employers’ payroll records, we have reconsidered the issue with payroll-based earnings and
hours data from most employers in Washington State over the period 2005-2015.
       Like the British payroll-based studies, we find that nominal wage cuts are far more
common that most of us had thought. In every one of the 40 four-quarters-apart periods for which
we observe year-to-year wage changes, we find that at least 20 percent of job stayers experience
nominal wage reductions. Like many previous studies, we find that both cuts and freezes in
nominal wages become even more common during a recession. We also find that the striking
frequency of nominal wage cuts is pervasive across industries and firm sizes.
       None of this is to deny that nominal wage stickiness exists in the world. After all, our own
salaries are set in nominal terms and typically are adjusted only once a year. But does such wage
stickiness stand in the way of efficient employment decisions? Empirically, as discussed above in
our footnote 9, it is very difficult to identify causal effects of wage stickiness on employment
outcomes. Theoretically, thanks to the classic analyses by Becker (1962) and Barro (1977), we
have long understood that, in the large part of the labor market with long-term employment



                                                 12
relationships (which is the part that departs the most from a flexible-wage spot market), short-run
wage stickiness need not prevent efficient employment outcomes. 12
        But what about those cases in which employment relationships can be preserved only if
nominal wages are cut? Keynes’s assertion in The General Theory (1936) was that workers are
so adamant about refusing nominal wage cuts that the workers would lose their jobs and become
unemployed instead. Undoubtedly, most of us workers hate to see reductions in our base pay or
other types of compensation, but would we really prefer to lose our jobs, especially in the midst of
an economic downturn? The new evidence from payroll records indicates that strikingly many job
stayers do suffer nominal wage cuts, and this finding calls into question whether resistance to
nominal wage cuts is as binding as often has been assumed. In keeping with our opening quotation
from the Dalai Lama, we urge economists “to keep searching for reality by empirical means and
to be willing to disregard accepted or long-held positions if our search finds the truth is different.”
