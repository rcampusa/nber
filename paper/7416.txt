                                           ABSTRACT

        We report findings from a survey of United States foreign exchange traders. Our results
indicate that: (i) The share of customer business, versus interbank business, has remained fairly
constant; (ii) The channels by which transactions take place have changed, as electronically-
brokered transactions have risen from 2% to 46% of total, mostly at the expense of transactions
undertaken by traditional brokers; (iii) The single most widely-cited reason for deviating from the
standard market convention on the bid-ask spread is a thin/hectic market; (iv) Half or more of
market respondents believe that large players dominate in the dollar-pound and dollar-Swiss franc
markets; and (v) 60% of respondents believe there is low predictability of exchange rates intraday.
Even at medium and long run horizons, only a third of traders believe that there is high
predictability.

1. Introduction

       The microstructure approach to exchange rates has garnered an increasingly large number

of adherents over recent years. This phenomenon is unsurprising given the well known

deficiencies of conventional macroeconomic models of exchange rates, especially at short

horizons (see for instance the critique by Flood and Taylor (1996)). Instead of focusing on the

typical macroeconomic fundamentals, such as inflation and interest rates, the microstructure

approach considers the effects of market configuration, information asymmetry, heterogeneity of

participants, and bounded rationality on exchange rate dynamics.

       In the spirit of the microstructure approach, this paper uses information drawn from a

survey of U.S.-based foreign exchange traders designed to elicit information about several aspects

of exchange rate dynamics not observable in typical data sets. In contrast to the conventional

research methodology adopted in economics -- theoretical modeling, estimation, and testing -- our

survey attempts to ascertain directly how market participants behave, document their experiences,

and solicit their views on the workings of the foreign currency market.1

       Two issues will likely arise in the reader’s mind. The first is the economists' skepticism of

survey methods, which has a long history. It derives from the aphorism of “watch what I do, not

what I say.” There is a concern that those individuals surveyed will respond strategically,

distorting their answer to gain some advantage. In general, there is little evidence that such

strategic distortion of responses occurs, and in any event, the responses to the questions

contained in this survey are unlikely to convey competitive advantage to the concerned agents.



       1
         A companion paper (Cheung and Chinn, 1999) examines the macroeconomic
implications of the survey responses. See also assessments of the East Asian markets in Cheung
and Wong (1999a,b).

                                                  1
Moreover, as argued by Blinder (1991), Shiller et al. (1991), among others, the results from a

properly designed survey can provide valuable facts that are not found in standard models and not

available to econometricians.

        Furthermore, the use of survey data has some well-known advantages. Rather than using

the representative agent paradigm, one can document the extent to which agents are

heterogeneous in their beliefs and behavior. This allows a more fully fleshed-out interpretation of

observed exchange rate dynamics. In view of empirical inadequacies exhibited by extant exchange

rate models, the findings uncovered by a well-constructed survey may provide some useful

insights on the market structure and practitioners' behavior.

        Admittedly, the use of survey data imposes certain limitations upon the researcher. In

certain instances, it is difficult to quantify the association between variables, and to construct

easily interpretable hypothesis tests. Hence, we cannot overstress the point that we view survey

data as a complement, rather than a substitute, for standard empirical analysis.

        The second issue pertains to the relevance of microstructure for those aspects of economic

behavior of interest to macroeconomists. One is tempted to assert that the microstructural

activities are but a mere sideshow compared to the underlying movements in the macroeconomic

fundamentals. This perspective has held sway because, in part, economists have not been able to

observe what traders react to. In recent work, Evans (1998) has used previously unavailable

market (as opposed to individual trader) data on quotes and transactions to link up the activities

of traders and asset prices over several months. He finds a strong relationship between excess

purchases of a currency, and the DM/US$ exchange rate. This, then, is an explicit tie between the

microstructure of the forex market and a macroeconomic variable. As the availability of such



                                                   2
finely-detailed data increases, it is likely that such links will become better established.

        Our study focuses on several interesting issues in exchange rate economics. One set of

survey questions examines the bid-ask spread of interbank quotes, which has received

considerable attention recently. Despite their diminutive size, bid-ask spreads have implications

for conditional volatility, mean returns, and return auto-correlations (Bollerslev and Domowitz,

1993; Bollerslev and Melvin, 1994). As it is difficult to gather marketwide data (e.g., trading

volume) on foreign exchange trading, the survey method offers an alternative means to study

bid-ask spreads in the interbank market. We also examine other microstructure issues, including

the existence of dominant players in certain currency markets, and the sources of competitive

advantage for large players, and the predictability of exchange rates.

        The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe the survey methodology

and overview the data set. In section 3, we discuss the survey responses in the context of several

major issues in the exchange rate microstructure literature. In section 4 we make some concluding

remarks.



2. Survey Methodology and Sample Overview

        The data used in this study were obtained from a mail survey of the foreign exchange

traders located in the United States. The survey was conducted between October 1996 and

November 1997. The mailing list was compiled from the 1996 and 1997 editions of the Dealers’

Directory published by the Hambros Bank. In preparing the questionnaire, we solicited and

incorporated advice and suggestions from several experienced practitioners.2 A total of 1796



        2
            A copy of the questionnaire is reproduced as Appendix A.

                                                   3
surveys were mailed, 44 of which proved undeliverable. The number of completed questionnaires

returned was 142. The response rate was approximately 8.1%.This rate is typical for mail

surveys.3 As of April 1998, the United States foreign exchange market was the second largest

after the London market, and constituted about one-fifth of the daily turnover of US$1971.0

billion (Bank for International Settlements, 1998).4

       Information about the respondents and their organizations is summarized in Table 1. As

indicated in Figure 1.a, most respondents are experienced practitioners. Over 80% of them

have the title "chief/senior dealer" or "treasurer/manager." Thus we are confident that the

views recorded in the survey are representative of participants with extensive experience in the

foreign exchange market.

       The intraday position limit is the maximum open position a dealer is authorized to

assume during the day. Since, in most cases, dealers square their positions at the end of a

trading day, the intraday position limit can be used as a proxy for a dealer's trading capacity. To

buttress this point, note that Lyons (1998) documents the half-life of a dealer’s position is only 10

minutes. Most respondents in Table 1.b have a daytime position limit below US$25 million.5 Only

a few respondents stated their position limits in terms of the value at risk.

       Figure 1.c indicates that, as expected, a plurality of the respondents are associated with

banks headquartered in the United States. Europe comes a close second. Japan comes far behind

as the next most likely headquarters location, with only 8%.



       3
          8% is bracketed by the “typical” rates of 5% and 10% cited by Alreck and Settle (1995).

          Figures are for traditional foreign exchange market activity, including spot, outright
forward and foreign exchange swaps.
        5
          Typically, these limits can be exceeded on authority of the chief dealer, although the
precise rules vary from organization to organization.

                                                   4
           Data on average daily turnover, which measures the activity and market share of a trading

bank, are reported in Figure 1.d. The response pattern indicates a bimodal distribution, with 31%

reporting a daily turnover of US$100-499 million, and 28% a figure of between US$1000-5000

million.

           It is of interest to view the evolution of the forex market. We document some salient

features in Table 1. In Panel 1.a, we investigate the proportion of transactions via either interbank

trades, traditional brokers, and electronic brokers.6 The responses indicate that five years prior to

the survey (1992), transactions were apportioned equally between interbank and traditional broker

trades. Transactions via electronic brokers constituted only about 2% of total trades. By 1996-97,

interbank transactions had fallen to roughly one-third of total transactions; at the same time,

traditional brokers lost considerable ground to electronic brokers, such that the latter constituted

46% of total trades, and the former only 17%! These figures accord well with the 1998 Federal

Reserve Bank of New York survey which indicated that almost 1/3 of all April 1998 spot

transactions were conducted through order-matching systems (Federal Reserve Bank of New

York, 1988: 6).7 Perhaps more telling are the minimum and maximum estimates of trade

conducted through each mode. Five years ago, the maximum response for trade taking place

through traditional brokers was 100%; the more recent maximum proportion is 80%. The

maximum proportion taking place through electronic brokers was 30% in the earlier period; more

recently, it is 95! Overall, it appears that electronic broker transactions have substituted out

mostly, but not exclusively, for traditional broker trades.

       While the mode of the transactions has changed substantially, the nature of the business

has remained remarkably constant. Panel 1.b reports that, on average, 62% of transactions were

interbank business related, virtually the same proportion as five years earlier, while 35% were

customer related.

3. Empirical Results

3.1 The Interbank Bid-Ask Spread

       Responses to survey questions regarding the magnitude of interbank bid-ask spreads are

presented in Figure 2. The questions involve (a) the magnitude of the average bid-ask spread, (b)

the frequency distribution of deviations from convention, (c) the frequency of adhereing to the

convention, (d) reasons for adherence to the convention, and (e) reasons for deviation from the

convention. Conventional spreads in the interbank market, according to respondents, are

displayed in Figure 2.a. While a wider spread is acceptable in a hectic market, the ability to

consistently offer quotes with these conventional spreads in a hectic market is regarded as an

essential characteristic of a market leader. The conventional spreads for four major trading

currencies reported in Figure 2.a are largely in accordance with those described by traders. These

numbers also confirm the observation that actual interbank spreads are narrower than indicative

quotes on the Reuters screen (Bessembinder, 1994; Lyons, 1995).

       In general, only a small proportion of interbank bid-ask spreads differ from the

conventional one (Figure 2.b) thus corroborating the reported clustering of bid-ask spreads at a

few distinct values (Bollerslev and Melvin, 1994; Lyons, 1995). Most of the non-conventional

spreads are narrower and only a few are wider: 26% of the respondents say that over 20% of their

quotes have spreads narrower than the conventional one, while 75% indicate that less than 10%



                                                  6
of their interbank quotes have a spread wider than the conventional one. One respondent provided

some possible explanations for this asymmetry. “Lower volatility enables the professional trader

to quote tighter prices, due to less risk. Secondly, professional dealers pride themselves on the

risk they are able to 'endure' via tighter pricing.”

        Figures 2.c to 2.e shed some insights on the rationale of deviating from the conventional

interbank spread. 69% of the respondents suggest the market norm, rather than the potential cost

of making a quote, determines their interbank bid-ask spreads in most circumstances (Figure 2.c).

        By far, the most frequently cited reason for adopting the conventional spread is to

"maintain an equitable and reciprocal trading relationship" (Figure 2.d). In the interbank market,

foreign exchange trading is conducted according to several tacit agreements that reduce

transaction costs and create a fair trading relationship. For example, traders are expected to

respond to a request for quotes within a reasonable time span. A two-way price with a

conventional spread is another practice traders expect from each other. The responses confirm

that practitioners tend to observe the tacit agreement to maintain an equitable trading

environment.

        Traders postulate that frequent violations of tacit agreements result in loss of reputation. It

is important for both banks and traders to maintain their reputation so others will choose to trade

with them. Offering quotes with a conventional spread is one of the ways in which a trader can

establish his reputation. Thus, it is not surprising to see "secure a good market image for the firm

and the dealer" as the second most cited reason for conforming to the conventional spread.

        Compared with the two preceding reasons, trading profits are a much less significant

factor for setting the spread. Less than 6% of respondents select this choice. This reinforces the



                                                       7
presumption that potential costs play a minor role in determining the spread (Figure 2.c). As one

trader said, “The bid/ask spread is hardly sufficient for a dealer to make money, unless his/her

desk has significant business on both sides of the market, such that they are able to 'capture' the

spread by both buying and selling with different counterparties. Dealers make the majority of their

profit on rate movement, not spread.”

       As reported in Figure 2.e, the most cited reason for deviating from the conventional

spread is a "thin and hectic market" (31%). This choice and the one of "thin and quiet market"

account for more than 40% of the responses. Liquidity effects, especially in the presence of

uncertainty as exemplified by a hectic market, seem to have significant implications for bid-ask

spreads.

       The role of uncertainty is further illustrated by 43% of the responses claiming "increased

market volatility," "before/after a major news release," and "unexpected change in market

activity" are the reasons for deviating from the market convention. These three reasons are related

to a potential increase in the level of market uncertainty. The choices of the volatility factor lend

support to the empirical findings reported in Bollerslev and Melvin (1994). Thus, our

respondents confirm anecdotal evidence, garnered from conversations, that wider bid-ask spreads

tend to occur under such circumstances. They also match with the statistical results obtained by

Jorion (1996) indicating a correlation between volatility and bid-ask spreads.

       Only a small percentage of respondents say they widen the spread when they are holding a

position against the market trend or the cost of keeping their positions is increasing. The

importance of these two inventory-cost related factors is played down (2%).

       Market traders we interviewed confirm that, given the trading mechanism, it is not



                                                   8
unexpected to observe the weak association between bid-ask spreads and trading positions

reported in Figure 2.e. Traders rely on interbank trading to access information on market

sentiments and other market makers' activities. Market moving news is mainly disseminated

through direct interbank dealing before brokered interbank transactions. Therefore, active traders

do not want to reveal information on their own unfavorable positions by offering a wide spread

quote. Compared with the wide swing of intraday exchange rates, a few points advantage

associated with a wide spread has very limited impact on trading profits. In addition, making wide

spread quotes under normal market conditions has the side effect of damaging a trader's

reputation and driving away potential trading opportunities, which can severely limit a dealer's

ability to read the market and make profitable trade in the future. Thus, most traders do not widen

the spread solely because of adverse positions. On the other hand, some practitioners pointed out

that a good trading position, for example a long dollar position when the dollar is strengthening,

gives a dealer an opportunity to establish or enhance his reputation as a trader by offering a good

two-way price in a hectic market without incurring a loss.

       Our survey results provide some indirect evidence of the asymmetric information effect on

interbank bid-ask spreads. A standard microstructure theory (Glosten and Milgrom, 1985)

predicts a trader will quote a wide spread when he believes his counterparty has superior

information. However, only a relatively small percentage of the responses consider dealing with

either a small bank or an informed trading bank as reasons for offering non- conventional spreads.

If the two types of banks represent market participants with, respectively, little and superior

market information, then most traders do not consider informational asymmetry in determining

their bid-ask spread. This finding complements the implication of a model recently developed by



                                                  9
Perraudin and Vitale (1996). The authors model the trading process as the means by which traders

acquire timely market information from other market participants and, consequently, show the

standard asymmetric costs argument may not apply to the decentralized foreign exchange market.

       Compared with the factors related to inventory and asymmetric costs, a slightly lower

percentage of responses say "a wide spread quote from a counterparty" is a reason for offering a

wide spread quote. Market participants offer two possible interpretations. First, the

counterparty's wide spread quote may signal some information which the trader is not aware of.

Second, as a protest and a demand for a fair trading relationship, traders do retaliate and offer a

wide spread quote back to the same counterparty.

3.2 Do Dominant Players Exist?

       In the US foreign exchange market, dollar/mark, dollar/yen, dollar/pound and dollar/Swiss

franc are the four most actively traded exchange rates (Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

1998). Less than 25% of our respondents believe the dollar/mark and dollar/yen markets are

dominated by a few big players (Figure 3.a). On the other hand, there is a split of opinion over the

dollar/pound rate. About 50% of the respondents say the dollar/pound market is dominated by a

few big players. Even more striking, for the Swiss franc almost 60% indicate that the big players

exert dominance. These two results may be related to the relatively small dollar/pound and

dollar/Swiss franc trading volumes in this markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York

survey shows that the daily average turnover of dollar/mark spot dealings in the New York

market was US$43.8 billion and that of the dollar/yen was US$30.5 billion in April 1998. During

the same period, however, the total daily average turnover of dollar/pound and dollar/Swiss franc




                                                 10
transactions in this market was only US$10.2 billion and US$7.6 billion, respectively. 8 In line with

this view, one trader suggested that low liquidity, rather than few players, was a key factor in the

dollar/Swiss franc market.9

       Interestingly, the response that large players exist, and do possess advantages is in

disagreement with remarks in Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1998: 8) that “the foreign

exchange market remained similarly competitive in 1998 compared to 1995.” The New York

Fed’s conclusions were based on a 5-firm market share of 31%, and a Herfindahl-Hirschman

index of market concentration of 317, interpeted by the New York Fed survey as a high value.

       With regard to the sources of large players' competitive advantage, respondents say "large

customer base" and "better information" about the market are the two main factors. These two

factors account for 56% of the total responses. Essentially, large players are perceived to have a

better customer and market network, which, in turn, give them better information on order flow

and the activity of other trading banks. The importance of a large customer base underscores

recent efforts to use customer orders to explain the trading mechanism and trading volume

(Lyons, 1997). The next two frequently mentioned sources are "deal in large volumes" and

"ability to affect exchange rates." Other factors receive a much lower response rate (15% and 9%,

respectively).



3.3 The Predictability of Exchange Rates

       There is an enormous literature documenting the difficulties of predicting exchange rates


       8
        These figures are for spot market trading which constitutes roughly half of total foreign
exchange trading (the other components are forward contracts, and swaps).
      9
        Although this same trader allowed that the relative paucity of traders in the Australian
and Canadian dollar markets may explain the dominance of a few players.

                                                 11
using structural or time series models (Frankel and Rose, 1995). In this section, we ask the

foreign exchange traders themselves how predictable they believe exchange rates are. This is an

interesting question because presumably the traders themselves have a larger information set than

the typical econometrician who has access only to macro data available intermittently, and to

selected financial variables such as interest rates and stock prices at high frequencies.

        We asked traders to rate the degree of predictability at three horizons – intraday, medium

run (up to six months) and long run (over six months). In Figure 4, a rating of 1 indicates no

predictability, while a rating of 5 indicates high predictability. Perhaps not surprisingly, at the

intraday frequency, exchange rates are viewed as essentially unpredictable. 62% give ratings of 1

or 2. The modal response is a 2 rating. Only 11% give ratings of 4 or 5.

        As the horizon moves to the medium and long run, the modal response becomes a rating

of 3. Interestingly, the distinction of medium- and long-run does not seem to matter for the

traders’ views on predictability. 30% of traders rate medium-run predictability as a 4 or 5, and

35% view predictability at the long-run similarly.

        The question why this pattern obtains remains a key puzzle in international finance. As

pointed out by Flood and Rose (1995), among many others, floating exchange rates are far more

variable than the observable macro determinants such as money stocks, interest and inflation rates.

The most persuasive explanations have been rooted in microstructural explanations, such as Osler

(1998). Osler presents a model wherein random shocks are translated into near random walk

behavior of the exchange rate by the activities of noise traders (De Long, et al., 1990).

4. Conclusions

        We have examined the responses of foreign exchange traders to questions regarding their



                                                   12
views about the operations of the foreign exchange market at the microstructural level. We have

uncovered a number of interesting findings. With respect to the characteristics of the market, the

share of customer business, versus interbank business, has remained fairly constant. However, the

channels by which these transactions take place have experienced considerable transformation, as

electronically-brokered transactions have become much more prominent.

       We also elicit interesting responses regarding the motivations for certain observable

behaviors in the foreign exchange market. First, the respondents do not view trading profits as the

most important reason for following the market convention; rather the desire to maintain equitable

and reciprocal trading relationships, followed by a desire to maintain a positive market image, are

the prominent answers. This pattern of responses indicates that other motivations not easily

captured by standard microstructure models may explain the adherence to market norms. Second,

the most commonly cited reason for single most important reason for departing from the

convention on bid-ask spreads is the onset of a thin/hectic market. This appears to conform to

some recent empirical work linking volatility and wide spreads. Third, the foreign exchange

market is not monolithic, when it comes to the issue of large players. In particular, while the

DM/dollar market is widely viewed as fairly competitive, the smaller dollar-pound and Swiss franc

markets are perceived as more dominated by the larger banks. Fourth, exchange rate predictability

is viewed as fairly low. Surprisingly, there is little variation in the proportion of traders who hold

this view over the various horizons – from intraday to over six months. However, this final display

of relative unanimity stands in stark contrast to the substantial heterogeneity in forex trader views

exhibited on a wide range of subjects.
