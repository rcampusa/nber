                                              ABSTRACT

The desegregation of Southern schools following the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown decision was perhaps
the most important innovation in U.S. education policy in the 20th century. This paper assesses the
effects of desegregation on its intended beneficiaries, black students. In Louisiana, substantial reductions
in segregation between 1965 and 1970 were accompanied by large increases in per-pupil funding.
This additional funding was used to "level up" school spending in integrated schools to the level previously
experienced only in the white schools. The effects of desegregation on the educational experiences
of black students differed substantially depending on the black share of enrollment in the district. For
historical reasons, blacks in districts with higher black enrollment shares experienced larger increases
in funding, compared to their counterparts in lower black enrollment share districts. On the other hand,
blacks in high black enrollment share districts saw smaller increases in exposure to whites (who were
higher-income). Blacks in high black enrollment share districts experienced larger improvements in
educational attainment, suggesting that the increase in funding associated with desegregation was more
important than the increased exposure to whites. A simple cost-benefit calculation suggests that the
additional school spending was more than offset by higher earnings due to increased educational attainment.
Using a different source of variation and methodology, the results of this paper are consistent with
earlier work suggesting that desegregation improved educational attainment for blacks and sheds new
light on the potential mechanism behind this improvement in Louisiana: increased funding for blacks'
schools.

         The Supreme Court’s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education—and the

desegregation of schools that followed—was perhaps the most important development in

U.S. education policy of the last century. Before Brown, Southern schools were explicitly and

completely segregated by law, and many blacks attended schools that received fewer

resources than those attended by their white counterparts.1 Previous work has shown that

desegregation policy reduced segregation and increased blacks’ exposure to whites in school.

In the case of Louisiana, school desegregation was also accompanied by dramatic changes in

the state’s system of school finance that, together with large increases in federal funding,

substantially increased the average spending in the schools blacks attended. Desegregation in

Louisiana virtually eliminated black-white gaps in student-teacher ratios within districts.

Historically, those gaps had been largest in districts with high black enrollment shares, so

blacks in high black enrollment share districts saw particularly large improvements in per-

pupil spending over the short period when schools desegregated. The desegregation

experience in Louisiana provides a unique setting in which to study the effects of large

increases in school funding over a short period, contributing both to the literature on the

effects of desegregation and the literature on the effects of school resources on educational

outcomes.

           After years of resistance, segregation in Louisiana’s schools fell dramatically

between 1965 and 1970. At the same time, average per-pupil revenue for schools increased

by about $1,000 to more than $3,700 (constant 2003 dollars). But this new money was not

distributed equally to all districts. Instead, districts with high black enrollment shares


1 The Coleman Report (1966) and Card and Krueger (1992) suggest that black-white school resource gaps had

closed substantially over the first half of the 20th century, but were still present. According to Card and Krueger
(1992), in 1954 the average student-teacher ratio for blacks was about 10 percent higher for blacks in Southern
and Border states, compared to their white counterparts. Data for Louisiana show that in 1955 the average
district’s instructional spending for blacks was only about 71 percent of instructional spending for whites.

garnered substantially larger increases in funding. In Reber (2006), I show that these

disproportionate increases in revenue for higher black enrollment share districts were

necessary to prevent whites in those districts from seeing their school quality fall and were at

least partly caused by desegregation policy. On the other hand, blacks in districts with higher

black enrollment shares saw smaller increases in exposure to whites (since there were fewer

whites in those districts).

        In this paper, I examine the effects of these two changes—increases in black

exposure to whites and increases in funding for blacks’ schools—on educational attainment

using variation in changes in these variables related to differences in districts’ initial black

enrollment share. Because changes in spending and exposure are both so closely tied to the

black enrollment share (positively and negatively, respectively), I cannot separately identify

the effects of these two factors. Instead, I estimate the net effect of desegregation-induced

changes in funding and peers. Newly collected annual data on school registration

(enrollment) by race and grade and the number of high school graduates by race for

Louisiana school districts allow me to estimate the fraction of black 8th grade students

continuing to 10th, 11th, and 12th grade and graduating from high school for cohorts of

students attending school before and after desegregation.

        The results indicate that the rate of continuing to the 11th and 12th grade, as well as

high school graduation rates, increased more in higher black enrollment share districts after

desegregation, suggesting that the additional funding that came with desegregation was more

important than increased exposure to whites in increasing black educational attainment. It

would also be interesting to estimate the effect of desegregation on educational attainment

for white students. Unfortunately, non-random migration of white students—in particular,




                                                -3-
“white flight” from districts with high black enrollment shares to “whiter” districts—

precludes conducting a similar analysis for whites.

         The paper proceeds as follows: Section II provides background on the legal history

of desegregation, Louisiana’s experience with desegregation, and the existing literature on the

effects of desegregation; Section III discusses the effects of desegregation on funding and

black exposure to whites; in Section IV, I discuss the methods and data; the results are

presented in Section VI. Section VI concludes.

II. Background and Previous Literature

A. Desegregation Policy and Trends in Segregation

         In 1954, the Supreme Court declared separate schools for black and white children

to be “inherently unequal.” But neither the 1954 Brown decision nor the 1955 Brown II

decision was specific about what districts were required to do to comply with this new

doctrine, and little progress was made for several years. Figure 1 shows trends in two

commonly used measures of segregation: black exposure to whites and white exposure to

blacks.2 Black exposure to whites can be interpreted as the white enrollment share of the

average black’s school (and vice-versa for white exposure to blacks); increases in black

exposure to whites indicate that blacks are in school with more whites, indicating a decline in

segregation.

         The data reveal three major turning points for segregation, corresponding to changes

in legislation and the courts’ interpretation of the Brown decision. Before the 1965 school

year (all years refer to the fall of the school year), there was very little progress toward

desegregation; in 1964, only about 1.2 percent of black students statewide were in school


2 For school years before 1967, black exposure to whites was imputed based on the share of blacks in school

with any whites. See Appendix A for information on sources of segregation data and the method for
imputation.


                                                    -4-
with any whites, and 61 of 64 counties in Louisiana still had completely segregated schools.

The 1964 Civil Rights Act (CRA) gave the Justice Department the authority to join

desegregation cases, and denied Federal funding to segregated districts, while the 1965

Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) expanded Federal funding for education

significantly. Together, these policies are thought to have brought about the first moves

towards desegregation in many Southern districts between 1965 and 1968.3 By 1968, only 11

of 64 counties in Louisiana were still completely segregated, but the average black was still in

a school that was only about 8 percent white, while whites comprised over 60 percent of

enrollment. Finally, following a 1968 Supreme Court decision4, larger-scale desegregation

plans began to be required. By 1970, the average black Louisianan was in a school that was

more than 30 percent white, and segregation stayed around that level through at least 1976.

This pattern is similar to trends in segregation for other states in the former Confederacy.

         In the analysis, I use data for 1960-1975, dividing the years into three periods: 1960-

1965 (before desegregation), 1966-1969 (transition), and 1970-1975 (after desegregation).

B. Desegregation and Black Educational Attainment: Mechanisms

         This paper examines educational attainment as the primary outcome of interest. In a

standard model of human capital accumulation, individuals attend an additional year of

school if the return on the labor market is greater than the discount rate. Desegregation

could increase the return to schooling by changing school quality for blacks through two

main channels. First, desegregation clearly changed the composition of students in blacks’

schools, as black exposure to whites increased. Previous work (discussed below) has found a

negative relationship between the black share of enrollment and educational outcomes, but it


3 See, for example, Card and Krueger (1992); Boozer, et al (1992); and Cascio, Gordon, Lewis, and Reber

(2006).

                                                    -5-
is unclear whether this relationship is causal or if school quality on other dimensions and

student background varies with black enrollment share. In fact, it is not obvious a priori

whether more white peers would be good or bad for school quality from blacks’ perspective,

although white peers are typically assumed to have a positive effect on outcomes, in part

because whites tended to have higher socioeconomic status and better scores on

achievement tests.

           Second, desegregation changed the average spending—and possibly other, less-

tangible aspects of school quality—in schools blacks attended by moving them to higher-

spending formerly white schools. In the case of Louisiana, desegregation also increased

overall average school spending so that spending could be equalized by “leveling up” to the

levels previously experienced only in the white schools, rather than “leveling down” closer to

that of the formerly black schools.

C. Previous Literature: The Effects of Desegregation on Education Outcomes

           Many studies have examined the effects of desegregation in a particular district or a

small number of districts, and have come to varying conclusions about the benefits of

desegregation.5 A number of larger-scale studies have examined the relationship between the

racial composition of students’ schools or classes and educational outcomes, but have been

less able to focus on changes in the racial composition due to desegregation policy, as

opposed to self-selection into districts with different racial composition. Guryan (2004) is a

recent exception, which I discuss further below.

           The Equality of Educational Opportunity study, also known as the Coleman Report

(1966) was the first to document a negative relationship between being in predominately

black schools and lower student test scores. Boozer, et al. (1992) use the National Survey of


5   St. John (1975), Crain and Mahard (1981), Cook (1984), and Armor (2002) (also reviewed in Guryan (2004)).


                                                      -6-
Black Americans data from 1979-1980 to show that blacks who attended segregated high

schools had lower educational attainment and lower wages. Rivkin (2000) similarly finds that

among a cohort of students who were sophomores in 1980, those who went to schools with

higher black enrollment shares had lower test scores, educational attainment, and earnings.

To assess the role of desegregation policy more directly, Boozer, et al. instrument for being

in a segregated high school with an interaction of the state where an individual grew up and

whether they went to high school after 1964 (when there appear to have been reductions in

segregation in Southern and Border states); the point estimates suggest that being in a

segregated school is bad for blacks’ outcomes, but the estimates are quite imprecise.

        Card and Krueger (1992, 1996a) examine the effects of pre-Brown narrowing of

black-white school quality gaps in Southern and Border states and North and South Carolina

on wages. They conclude that improvements in resources in the black schools relative to

white schools improved wages for blacks and contributed to the subsequent narrowing of

the black-white wage gap. This paper shows that black-white school quality gaps persisted in

Louisiana after the period examined by Card and Krueger and examines the effects of the

virtual elimination of these gaps due to desegregation in the late 1960s.

        Guryan (2004) provides the best-identified effects of desegregation plans. He exploits

variation in the timing of implementation of desegregation plans across districts, using

Census data to assess the effects of desegregation on black high school drop-out rates for a

national sample of large school districts implementing major court-ordered desegregation

plans. He compares changes in dropout rates between the 1970 and 1980 Censuses for

districts that implemented a plan during that decade to changes for those that implemented

plans before 1970 and after 1980. He estimates that implementation of a desegregation plan

reduced dropout rates for blacks by about 3 percentage points. This paper complements

Guryan’s by using a different methodology and source of variation to examine the effects of

desegregation on educational outcomes. In addition, I am able to examine the

mechanisms—namely changes in funding and peers—by which desegregation may affect

outcomes.

III. How did Desegregation Change Blacks’ Schools? Effects on Peers and

Resources

         Desegregation had dramatic effects on the characteristics of the schools that black

Louisianans attended. The two major classes of inputs—peers and money—changed

significantly statewide, but blacks in some districts saw bigger changes than others. These

differential changes across districts arose due to the historical differences in the way districts

with different black enrollment shares financed education.

A. Effects of Desegregation on School Spending

         One potentially important input to school quality is money,6 which allows schools to

reduce student-teacher ratios and buy other inputs. In this section, I will focus on changes in

student-teacher ratios, both because teachers represent a large portion of the school budget

and, more pragmatically, the student-teacher ratio can be measured separately for blacks and

whites. (Measures such as per-pupil revenue and expenditure are generally reported only at

the school district level; cross-district changes in revenue and expenditure are consistent with

those reported for student-teacher ratios.)

         In previous work (Reber, 2006), I explore changes in the financing of Louisiana

schools brought by desegregation in detail. Because understanding changes in funding is

important for the analysis of educational attainment, I summarize the key findings here. To


6 The role of school spending (and other measures of resources available to schools) in improving educational

outcomes is controversial. See Hanushek (1986) and Card and Krueger (1996a, 1996b) for a summary of the
extensive literature on this topic.


                                                    -8-
understand the changes in districts’ finances, one must first understand the pre-

desegregation school finance regime in the South, in particular the importance of a district’s

black share of enrollment in its finances. Before desegregation, black-white spending gaps

were largest in states, counties, and school districts with higher black enrollment shares.

Research on school finance in the South during this period7 suggests an explanation for this

relationship: Southern state governments generally distributed aid on a per-pupil basis, but

local school officials had discretion over how to distribute aid among black and white

schools. 8 Under this system, whites in districts with large black populations could satisfy

their increasing demand for school quality by directing state money allocated for black

students to white schools, resulting in larger gaps between student-teacher ratios in “blacker”

districts. 9

         Despite the “separate but equal” requirement of Plessy (never mind the desegregation

requirements of Brown), significant gaps between resources available in black and white

schools in Louisiana persisted in the 1960s.10 From 1960-1965 (the “before” period), the

average student-teacher ratio in Louisiana’s black schools was 29, compared to 24 for

whites.11 These gaps were significantly larger in districts with higher black enrollment shares.


7 See Bond (1934), Margo (1990), and Card and Krueger (1992).
8 For the results on educational attainment, it is not necessary to know the precise mechanism behind the
relationship between black enrollment share and black-white student teacher ratios. In any case, the data
indicate a strong positive relationship that was eliminated during the period of desegregation.
9 There is a political economy explanation for the persistence of this system of school finance. Representatives

to the state legislature were allocated based on total population, but blacks were generally not permitted to vote.
Whites in districts with high black enrollment shares were over-represented in the legislature relative to whites
in low black enrollment share districts. This may account for the between-district inequality of funding across
districts among whites that the system perpetuated.
10 Trends in funding for other Southern states after 1950 have not been documented to my knowledge.
11 Normally, school-level data would be required to calculate the average student-teacher ratio separately for

blacks and whites. When students and teachers are completely segregated by race (black teachers only teach
black students), the student-teacher ratio for blacks in the district can be calculated using the total number of
black students and black teachers (and similarly for whites). According to the Southern Education Reporting
Service, students and teachers in Louisiana were still completely segregated through at least 1966, with the
exception of the Orleans Parish school district. The Louisiana Department of Education’s Annual Financial and
Statistical Report, from which these data were collected, also published instructional spending separately for
blacks and whites through 1959-60, when the average district spent 72 cents per pupil in the black schools for


                                                      -9-
The left panel of Figure 2 shows the relationship between the 196012 black enrollment share

and the black-white gap in student-teacher ratios (black student-teacher ratio less white

student-teacher ratio) for 1960-1965, before significant desegregation had occurred. The

slope of the regression line in the left panel of Figure 2 is 9.4 with a t-statistic of 4.1,

indicating that a 10 percentage point increase in black enrollment share was associated with

an increase in the black-white student-teacher ratio gap of about 0.94 students. The 1960

black enrollment share is fairly evenly distributed between 10 and 70 percent.

         By requiring blacks and whites to attend the same schools, desegregation reduced

whites’ ability to divert funding for black children to their own schools.13 As a result, overall

school funding was increased during the period of desegregation so that whites were

approximately “held harmless” and did not see student-teacher ratios rise as their schools

combined with blacks’ schools. Because pre-existing black-white gaps were larger in higher

black enrollment share districts, blacks in those districts saw larger improvements in the

student-teacher ratios as a result of equalization. The right panel of Figure 2 shows the

relationship between 1960 black enrollment share and the average black-white student-

teacher ratio gap for 1970-1972 on the same scale as that for the left panel.14 The black-white

gap in student-teacher ratios was virtually eliminated and the relationship between the black-

white gap and black enrollment share disappeared.15




every dollar in the white schools. According to Margo (1990), this ratio was less than 20 cents per dollar around
1910.
12 Throughout the analysis, I use the black enrollment share for 1960 because 1960 is early enough that the

black enrollment share was plausibly unaffected by desegregation policy. In fact, districts’ black enrollment
share is very stable over time, and the results are very similar if the black enrollment share from another year is
used.
13 Some ability to direct resources within schools to whites, especially through tracking in high school, most

likely offset some of the reduction in between-school inequality.
14 The OCR survey stopped collecting school-level data on teachers after 1972.
15 See Appendix B for more information about how student-teacher ratios by race were calculated.

         Figure 3 shows how changes in the two major classes of inputs—student-teacher

ratios and peers—related to initial black enrollment share. The left panel shows the change in

the black student-teacher ratio from 1960-1965 to 1970-1972 against the initial black

enrollment share. The slope of the regression line is -7.4 (with a t-statistic of 3), indicating

that blacks in districts with a 10 percentage point higher initial black enrollment share saw a

0.74 student larger decline in student-teacher ratios, on average, from before to after

desegregation.16 The large reductions in student-teacher ratios in higher black enrollment

share districts was due to the closing of the relatively large black-white student-teacher ratio

gaps that existed before desegregation.

B. Effects of Desegregation on Peers

         That changes in blacks’ exposure to whites upon desegregation would vary with the

share of enrollment that is white—and therefore the black enrollment share—is

straightforward. Before desegregation, blacks in all districts had the same level of exposure

to blacks—none. But after desegregation, whites in districts that initially had low black

enrollment shares had significantly higher exposure to whites. This is expected, as even if

schools within districts are integrated, blacks cannot be exposed to many whites if there are

not many whites in their district. The right panel shows the strong negative relationship

between initial black enrollment share and the change in black exposure to whites—the

regression line has a slope of -1.05 (t=13.3).

IV. Methods and Data

16 In Reber (2006), I examine changes in school finance in more detail and argue that the observed changes

were caused by, not just coincident with, desegregation policy. Using annual data on per-pupil revenue by
source, I show that the timing of increased spending corresponds very well with desegregation, rather than
reflecting a gradual increase in revenue over time. Data limitations prevent a similar analysis of annual student-
teacher ratios, but teachers appear to be the primary category on which additional revenue was spent, so results
would most likely be similar. For this study, it is not critical that the changes in student-teacher ratios and
exposure to whites were caused by desegregation as it is that they were large and rapid. Some readers may
rather interpret the results as the effect of increased spending and changes in peers, rather than the effects of
desegregation policy, per se.

A. Empirical Approach

       Changes in peers and resources varied systematically with initial black enrollment share,

so I examine how changes in educational attainment related to initial black enrollment share.

Whether blacks in higher enrollment share districts are expected to have more or less

improvement in educational outcomes as a result of desegregation depends on whether

exposure to whites (who probably also had higher achievement) per se or exposure to more

resources is more important. Because changes in both spending and revenue are so closely

tied to the initial black enrollment share, their effects cannot be separately identified, and the

estimated differential change in educational attainment represents the net effect of changes

in peers and changes in funding.

       The simplest specification relates the change in attainment from before to after

desegregation to the initial black enrollment share. In this case, the dependent variable of

interest is simply the average attainment for 1970-1975, less the average attainment for 1960-

where Δattain is described above, 1960%black is the black share of enrollment for county17 c

in 196018 and ε c is an error term. The estimate of β1 indicates the extent to which subsequent

changes in attainment varied with initial black enrollment share. If increases in resources




17 Because some data are available only at the county level, I estimate the regression at the county, rather than

district, level. Louisiana had three City districts; these were combined with their county for analysis.
18 The black enrollment share of a county is fairly stable over time; results are similar if the black enrollment

share from another year is used. I use data from 1960 because it is early enough that it is unlikely to have been
influenced by desegregation.

vice-versa if exposure to whites is more important than increased funding.

         Controls for other characteristics of counties that might be related to both

1960%black and changes in attainment can also be included in the regression:

pre-existing county characteristics. I discuss the control variables in more detail when I

present the results below.

         If differential changes in attainment by black enrollment share are caused by changes

in schools related to desegregation, we would expect the changes in attainment to be closely

timed with the observed differential changes in black exposure to whites and funding19 rather

than a gradual trend over the whole period (which would show up as a statistically significant

                                    ~
estimate of β1 in equation (1a) and β1 in equation (1b)). In order to observe the timing of

differential changes in attainment by black enrollment share, I estimate the equations of the

following form:

(2)            attain ct = θ t + 1960%blackc × γ t + ν ct ,


where 1960%black is the 1960 black enrollment share (as above) and separate intercepts ( θ t )

and coefficients ( γ t ) are estimated for each year between 1960 and 1975. This is equivalent

to estimating univariate regressions of attain on 1960%black separately for each year (the

constant and main 1960%black effect are excluded in favor of a full set of year effects and

interactions). If γ t is increasing with t, this indicates that attainment grew faster in higher

per-pupil revenue and expenditure, but student-teacher ratios are not available annually.

black enrollment share districts over time, and vice-versa if γ t is declining with t. The

pattern of γ t ’s shows the timing of differential changes in attainment by black enrollment

share. I present the results of estimating equation (2) graphically.20

B. Measuring Educational Attainment

         High-frequency individual-level data with county identifiers on completed attainment

or school enrollment status are unavailable for this period. A proxy for the dropout rate for

each cohort-district-year can be created using Louisiana administrative data on the number

of students enrolling in school by grade, district, year, and race. To check the validity of the

attainment estimates, I first present estimates of state-wide trends in the educational

attainment variables for 1960-1975 based on the Louisiana administrative data and compare

these to trends estimated from the 1980 Census IPUMS. I will apply a similar methodology

below to estimate educational attainment variables at the district level using the

administrative data.

         If families did not move into or out of the state (and there were no mortality), I

could infer the share of each cohort continuing to each grade by following a cohort through

its entire school career, estimating dropout rates at every grade. For example, for the cohort

entering 1st grade in the Fall of 1961, 1st grade data would be taken from the 1961 report, 2nd

grade data from the 1962 report, and so on; the share of the cohort reaching at least 12th

grade would be the ratio of 12th grade registration in 1972 to 1st grade registration in 1961.21

         Of course, in practice, the change in a cohort’s size between 1st and 12th grade also

reflects movements of families into and out of the state. In order to reduce the scope for

such movements to affect the estimated 12th grade enrollment rates, I divide 12th grade

20 Similar to equation (1b), controls for pre-existing characteristics of counties could be included by estimating
a separate coefficient on each characteristic for each year (or groups of years). Because the control variables
have little substantive effect on the coefficients, I do not present the results.
21 This also assumes that patterns of grade repetition are not changing over time.

registration by 8th grade registration 4 years prior (rather than 1st grade), assuming that there

is no “true” dropping out until after the fall of 8th grade. I refer to the share of a cohort that

registers for 12th grade as the 12th grade “continuation rate,” and similarly for 10th and 11th

grade; the estimated share of a cohort completing high school is referred to as the graduation

rate. If migration of families with older and younger children is similar, changes in cohort

size for younger grades can be used to net out the effects of migration. Thus, I construct the

12th grade continuation rate, net of the average 4-year change for cohorts in 5th-8th grades in

for grade g in year t. Continuation rates for 10th and 11th grade and high school graduation

rates are constructed similarly.22

            For comparison, I estimate trends in the fraction of blacks born in Louisiana who

attended at least some 10th, 11th, and 12th grade23 or graduated from high school using the 1980

Census IPUMS.24 If the estimates based on the administrative data are not contaminated by

differential migration of families with younger and older children, these two series should

track each other. Figure 4 presents the series based on the Census and the administrative

data from Louisiana for each of the continuation rates. To better compare the trends (and

because only the trends and not the levels of continuation and graduation rates are

meaningful), I rescale continuation and graduation rates from the administrative data to

                                                                 - 15 -
equal the estimate from the Census for 1960. Trends from the two sources track reasonably

well, especially for 12th grade continuation rate and high school graduation rate.

         Recall that increases in black exposure to whites and the accompanying increases in

funding were concentrated in 1965-1970, especially 1968-1970 (Figure 1). The state-wide

average trends in educational attainment for blacks in Louisiana do not appear to be well-

explained by the timing of desegregation policy. Attainment rose through about 1968,

leveling off or declining slightly in the early 1970s. Other factors may have influenced these

trends, however, potentially masking improvements due to desegregation.

         There is no readily available control group, but comparisons to trends for blacks in

other regions (where desegregation did not occur or took a different form) and whites are

suggestive of improvements in educational attainment in the post-desegregation period.

Figure 5 shows trends in educational attainment for those born in Louisiana, the states of

the former Confederacy, the Border states, and the rest of the country25 separately for blacks

and whites. Graduation rates for whites in all regions and blacks outside the Confederate

states were declining after 1970, while graduation rates were flat or increasing for blacks in

Louisiana and the Confederate states as a whole.26 While far from definitive, this is

suggestive that desegregation may have improved educational attainment for Southern

blacks. On the other hand, the largest improvements in Louisiana-born blacks’ graduation

rates (absolutely and relative to other groups) occurred around 1964 or 1965, before the

effects of desegregation policy on spending and black exposure to whites kicked in.

Ashenfelter, Collins, and Yoon (2006) pursue this approach more systematically, comparing

25 The usual Census region “South” is subdivided into Confederate and Border states due to their slightly
different history with desegregation. The Census Bureau also classifies Missouri as in the Midwest region; I
have reclassified it as part of the Border region here. Trends for the three non-Southern regions (West,
Midwest, and Northeast) are similar, so they are combined in “Non-South”.
26 The downward trend in the early 1970s could result from the acquisition of GEDs for earlier cohorts, while

later dropouts have not had as much time to acquire a GED. Estimates of trends in dropouts for these cohorts
based on the 1990 Census are similar, but do show a slightly smaller decline in the early 1970s.

educational attainment and wages for different cohorts of blacks and whites born in

different regions. They conclude that the desegregation effort did contribute to

improvements in educational attainment and wages for blacks.

         I construct continuation rates at the district level using the same methodology and

administrative data below. The district-level estimates cannot be compared to Census data,

but it is reassuring that the statewide trends for the two data sources match reasonably well.

C. Data Sources

         Louisiana has 64 county (Parish) school districts; at the beginning of the period,

there were also three city districts. One of the city districts combined with its county in the

late 1960s. Because some of the variables are available only at the county level, I combine the

city districts with their respective counties and conduct the analysis at the county level.27 The

key variables in the analysis were collected from the Louisiana Department of Education

Annual Financial and Statistical Reports for 1954-1975, which report information on a variety of

variables at the school district level, including the number of teachers by race (used to

construct student-teacher ratios for 1960-1965), fall registration by grade and race (used to

construct continuation rates), the number of high school graduates by race, total revenue and

total expenditure.

         Proxies for pre-existing socioeconomic status and voter registration at the county

level were taken from the 1960 Census county tabulations and a dataset compiled by

Matthews and Prothro for their studies of voting in the South.28 Data on segregation (black

exposure to whites and white exposure to blacks) were taken from two sources. For 1960 to


27 Cameron Parish (county) is excluded from the analysis. The district had substantial oil reserves on school

district property (Section 16 lands), which generated substantial revenue for the district during this period. The
finances of the schools were therefore quite different from those of other school districts, and the district is an
extreme outlier in funding and student-teacher ratios.
28 I am grateful to Jim Alt for providing an electronic version of the Matthews-Prothro data.

1966, black exposure to whites was estimated based on data collected by the Southern

Education Reporting Service and published in various editions of Statistical Summary of School

Segregation-Desegregation in the Southern and Border States.29 For later years, I use the school-level

surveys of students and teachers by race conducted by the U.S. Department of Health

Education and Welfare (HEW) Office of Civil Rights (OCR).30

         Appendix A provides more detail on all the data sources.

V. Results

         As shown graphically in Figure 3, blacks in high black enrollment share districts saw

larger increases in resources and smaller increases in exposure to whites compared to blacks

in lower black enrollment share districts. I can also show this with and without controls for

preexisting district characteristics by estimating equations (1a) and (1b) with the change in

black exposure to whites (Table 1a) and black student-teacher ratios (Table 1b) on the left-

hand-side. The first column of Table 1a shows the mean and standard deviation for the

control variables. The regression of the change in black exposure on 1960%black shows a

strong negative relationship between black enrollment share and black exposure to whites,

with an estimated coefficient of -1.05; controls for pre-existing characteristics have little

effect on the coefficient. Table 1b shows that a 10 percentage point increase in 1960%black is

associated with an additional reduction in black student-teacher ratio of 0.74 (first column);

the inclusion of controls reduces the estimates (in absolute value) by about a third.




29 SERS reports the share of black students in school with any whites. When only a small share of blacks were
in school with whites, exposure of blacks to whites is approximately equal to the share of blacks with any
whites (since those in school with whites were in schools that were virtually 100 percent white and the
remaining blacks were in schools that were virtually 100 percent black). The segregation data are described in
greater detail in Appendix A.
30 I am grateful to Ben Denckla for converting the school-level OCR data from its antiquated format.




                                                    - 18 -
         Because of the method used to estimate school continuation rates (the share of each

cohort continuing to each grade), it is critical that mobility among counties in Louisiana

during the period of the study not be correlated with the county’s initial black enrollment

share. Recall that I estimate the 12th grade continuation rate for a district as the ratio of

students registering for 12th grade to the number of students registering for 8th grade four

years prior. If students leave (enter) the district, I will under (over) estimate the continuation

rate.31 However, if those movements are not correlated with initial black enrollment share,

migration will not bias estimates of the coefficient on 1960%black, but will simply introduce

classical measurement error to the dependent variables.

         Fortunately, I can assess the plausibility of this assumption by examining the

relationship between black enrollment share and changes in continuation rates for younger

grades. If there is no true dropping out among younger children32, then continuation rates

for younger children can be used to assess whether mobility is correlated with black

enrollment share. Indeed, the analysis of continuation rates for younger grades provides no

evidence that black mobility was correlated with initial black enrollment share, suggesting

that changes in continuation rates for upper grades are likely to reflect differential changes in

the true rate of dropping out.33 White mobility, on the other hand, was significantly related

to black enrollment share, as white enrollment shifted dramatically from higher to lower

black enrollment share counties during the period of desegregation (Reber, 2006). This

precludes using a similar methodology to assess the effects of desegregation on white

educational attainment.

31 Note that the enrollment data employed in the analysis include private school enrollment, so movements
from public to private school or vice versa are not problematic for the construction of continuation rates by
district. Black private enrollment is quite small in any case.
32 It is possible that some younger children have low attendance rates, but it seems unlikely that many would

not register for school at all. The measure of enrollment I employ here is based on fall registration.
33 This requires the additional assumption that families with older and younger children do not migrate

differentially in a way that is correlated with districts’ initial black enrollment share.


                                                    - 19 -
A. Continuation Rates for Younger Grades

        Table 2a shows the relationship between changes in continuation rates and initial

black enrollment share for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade (6th, 7th, and 8th grade registration divided by

4th grade registration 2, 3, and 4 years prior, respectively; these can be compared to results

for 10th, 11th, and 12th grade continuation rates, respectively). The first column in each set

shows the results for equation (1a) with no controls; the second and third columns with

controls (equation (1b)) are reported for consistency with the results reported in Table 4 for

higher grade continuation rates; the controls do not substantially affect the coefficients of

interest. The coefficients on initial black enrollment share are not significantly different from

0 for any of the grades or specifications, indicating that changes in the continuation rates for

younger grades were not related to initial black enrollment share. I show the results

estimating equation (2) for the 6th, 7th and 8th grade continuation rates together with the

results for the upper grades below. These also show no differential trend in continuation

rates for lower grades among districts with higher initial black enrollment shares.

        To reduce noise in the lower grade registration rates, I take advantage of data for a

larger number of lower grades, estimating equations (1a) and (1b) for the average 2-, 3-, and

4-year “lagged” continuation rates for 5th-8th grade (again, for comparison to 10th, 11th, and

                                                                                      1 8 reg tg

where l indexes the number of years lagged and g indexes grade. The results with avgrate as

the dependent variable are presented in Table 2b. Again, the coefficients on 1960%black are

insignificant and close to zero. The standard errors are smaller than when a single grade’s

registration rate is analyzed alone, yielding relatively precisely estimated zeros.




                                               - 20 -
          Changes in continuation rates for lower grades show no significant correlation with

initial black enrollment share, providing support for the assumption that mobility is

unrelated to 1960%black. I therefore turn to the analysis of registration rates for higher

grades.

B. Main Results: Continuation Rates Older Grades

          To estimate registration rates for 10th, 11th, and 12th grade and high school graduation

rates, registration in the relevant grade (or number of high school graduates) is divided by 8th

grade registration (the closest year unaffected by true dropping out) for the same cohort;

                      reg t10                    reg t11                 reg t12                      grads tHS

                                                                    t  =          , and contrate HS
                                                                                                 t  =           . I
                      reg t8− 2                 reg t8−3                 reg t8−4                      reg t8−4

compare those with 6th, 7th, and 8th grade registration divided by 4th grade registration for the

same cohort, respectively, as well as the 2-, 3-, and 4-year lagged avgrate, respectively,

described above.

          To test the hypothesis that the continuation rates rose differentially by 1960%black, I

estimate equation (1a) for the upper grades. Because the results for younger grades show no

evidence of differential migration, I also estimate equation (1a) for the upper grades,

controlling for the change in the 5th-8th grade lagged continuation rate. The results, with and

without controlling for the change in average 5th-8th grade lagged registration rates, are

presented in Table 3. The point estimates indicate that black educational attainment rose

more in districts with higher 1960%black. Controlling for changes in low-grade continuation

rates, the coefficients on 1960%black indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in

1960%black was associated with a 1.3, 1.9, and 1.8 percentage point larger increase in the

continuation rates for 11th grade, 12th grade, and high school graduation, respectively; the

estimated coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero at the 10 percent level



                                                         - 21 -
for 11th grade and at the 5 percent level for 12th grade and high school graduation. The

coefficient for the 10th grade continuation rate is relatively small and statistically insignificant.

(The 1960 black enrollment share ranges from about 10 to 70 percent, with a mean and

median both around 40 percent; the standard deviation of this variable is 0.16.)

         The results show that high black enrollment share districts saw larger increases in

educational attainment during the period of desegregation.

C. Specification Checks

         If black enrollment share is correlated with other characteristics of counties that were

related to changes in attainment, the estimated relationship between 1960%black and

attainment could be due to factors other than the desegregation-induced changes in funding

and peers. For example, if blacks in high black enrollment share districts were less educated

at the beginning of the period, they might naturally improve at a faster rate over time, and

the effects of increases in funding due to desegregation (due to higher initial black

enrollment share) would be overstated.

         There are three important potential confounders for which I can include proxies in

the regression. First, the socioeconomic status of blacks living in a district may be correlated

with black enrollment share, and counties with different socioeconomic status may be on

different educational attainment trends. I use several proxies for SES of blacks and the

population of the county as a whole from the 1960 Census (nonwhite median income,

nonwhite median education, percent of households with complete plumbing, and the

percent of population living in urban areas).34




34 Note that the poverty line was not defined until after 1960, so county tabulations of poverty rates are not

available from the 1960 Census. (Poverty status is available on the 1960 IPUMS, but county identifiers are not.)
I therefore, use the prevalence of complete plumbing as a proxy for poverty.


                                                     - 22 -
         Second, during the 1960s, black participation in politics increased following the

passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Before VRA, black registration was particularly low

in predominately black counties; to the extent that VRA helped equalize registration across

counties, political participation would have increased more in blacker districts. In addition,

blacks are a larger share of the voting-age population in blacker districts, so increased black

participation may translate to improved circumstances for blacks more in those counties. I

control for the share of the black voting age population (VAP) registered to vote in 1960 and

the change from 1964 to 1968 in the share of black VAP registered, collected by Matthews

and Prothro (1963a, 1963b).

         Finally, the economic climate, especially the availability of employment, is an

important input to the decision to enroll in school, as expanded employment opportunities

increase the opportunity cost of schooling. Frequent district-level data on employment are

not available for this period; but I am able to control for the log change in total employment

from 1963 to 1970-1975.35

         Another potential contributor to changes in educational attainment is changes in

compulsory schooling laws. Some Southern states changed compulsory schooling laws

during the period of desegregation because the state did not want to force whites to go to

integrated schools. Fortunately for this study, there were no changes in compulsory

schooling laws in Louisiana during this period.36

         Tables 4a and 4b show the results of estimating equation (1b), including controls for

pre-existing county characteristics. The first column (no controls) of Table 3 is repeated for

comparison. Except for 10th grade continuations rate (where the estimated coefficient on

1960%black was already small and insignificant), the inclusion of controls increases the

coefficients by about a quarter. If anything, high black enrollment share districts had other

characteristics associated with declining educational attainment for blacks.

        In addition to controlling for pre-existing county characteristics and changes in

employment, I can examine the timing of changes in attainment in more detail. The

differential increases in funding and exposure to whites were concentrated between 1965 and

1970; so if the differential improvements in attainment documented above were due to these

changes, we would expect them to be concentrated in these same years (or at least not a

gradual upward trend over the whole period). Two factors limit our ability to assess the

timing of changes in black educational attainment somewhat. First, the annual attainment

data are somewhat noisy, so year-to-year changes are not as precisely estimated as the

differences in averages over longer periods. Second it is not obvious ex ante when changes in

funding and peers should translate into changes in outcomes. We might expect lags between

changes in schools and changes in outcomes, but we would not expect changes in outcomes

to lead changes in schools due to desegregation. Despite these difficulties, the estimates of

equation (2) are instructive, suggesting the differential improvements in educational

attainment among high black enrollment share districts were concentrated between 1967 and

1971, consistent with a causal effect on attainment of increased funding around the same

time.

        The first panel of Figure 6 shows the results of estimating equation (2) for the 10th

grade registration rate and plotting the interactions of 1960%black with the year dummies.

(Recall that this is equivalent to estimating year-by-year univariate regressions of 10th grade

registration rate on 1960%black.) For comparison, I also plot the results for the 6th grade

continuation rate (6th grade registration divided by 4th grade registration two years prior) and



                                              - 24 -
the average 5th-8th grade 2-year lagged continuation rate. The remaining panels of Figure 6

show the results for the 11th and 12th grade continuation and high school graduation rates,

with the relevant low-grade comparison groups. First, Figure 6 shows that for none of the

younger grade continuation rates is a trend in the coefficients evident, confirming that

blacks’ mobility was not correlated with initial black enrollment share.

        The coefficient for the 10th grade continuation regressions increased around 1972,

and for 11th grade continuation, it increased around 1969 or 1970. The coefficient for the

12th grade continuation and high school graduation rate regressions rose slightly earlier

around 1968. The results are consistent with a larger increase in black continuation rates for

high 1960%black districts around the time of desegregation, when those districts experienced

larger increases in per-pupil funding but smaller increases in exposure to whites.

        Controlling for changes in younger grades, the results are similar to those shown in

Figure 6 and are presented in Figure 7. Estimates of the coefficient on black enrollment

share for the 10th and 11th grade registration rates began rising around 1969 and were higher

on average in the post-desegregation period (left panel). The estimates for 12th grade

registration and high school graduation rates increased substantially around 1968 and

continued to rise thereafter (right panel).

        The main finding that black educational attainment increased more in higher black

enrollment share counties during the period of desegregation is not substantially influenced

by the inclusion of control variables. Further, the timing of the increases closely matches the

timing of differential increases in funding and reductions in student-teacher ratios for blacks

due to desegregation, suggesting that desegregation policy—and the changes in the system of

school finance it brought—helped improve black educational attainment in Louisiana.

VI. Conclusion and Discussion



                                              - 25 -
        The analysis presented above shows that, during the five years of the most intensive

desegregation activity in Louisiana, districts with higher black enrollment shares saw

substantially larger increases in per-pupil funding. Blacks in those districts saw large

reductions in student-teacher ratios as black-white school quality gaps closed but also smaller

increases in exposure to whites. The finding that blacks in higher black enrollment share

districts experienced significantly larger increases in educational attainment during this

period suggests that the increased funding that came with desegregation was more important

than the increased exposure to whites.

        The results suggest that increased funding associated with desegregation improved

educational attainment for blacks, but the magnitudes of the coefficients presented in Tables

3 and 4 are not easily compared to the existing literature. I therefore provide two “back-of-

the-envelope” calculations of the effects of school funding on educational attainment

implied by the estimates. First, I estimate the elasticity of high school graduation rates with

respect to school spending. I am not aware of existing literature estimating the cost of

programs that increase high school graduation rates, however, so it is not clear to what this

estimate should be compared. I therefore also conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis: I

compare the net present value of additional wages induced by desegregation-related increases

in school spending to the net present value of additional school spending for the affected

cohorts. While the calculation necessarily requires a number of assumptions, desegregation-

induced spending appears to have had positive net benefits for reasonable values of the

relevant parameters.

        To estimate the increase in high school graduation rates per additional dollar spent, we

need to know the differential increase in spending for high black-enrollment-share districts.

Estimating equation (1) with per-pupil revenue as the dependent variable yields a coefficient



                                              - 26 -
on 1960%black of 1.7 (thousands of 2003 dollars), indicating that a 10 percentage point

increase in 1960%black is associated with an additional increase in per-pupil revenue of $170

(not reported).37 Dividing the coefficient on the 1960%black from the high school graduation

rate regression (0.19) by that from the per-pupil revenue regression yields an estimate of

0.11; thus, a $1,000 differential increase in funding (in constant 2003 dollars) during the

period of desegregation was associated with an 11 percentage point increase in the black

high school graduation rate. Average per-pupil spending in the pre-desegregation period

(1960-1965) was $2,400. Based on the 1980 Census, the average high school graduation rate

for pre-desegregation cohorts was 68 percent. The estimates suggest, therefore, that a 42

percent desegregation-induced increase in per-pupil revenue resulted in a 17 percent increase

in high school graduation rates.

         A fuller accounting of the effect of desegregation on educational attainment should

include increases in educational attainment at points in the educational distribution below

high school graduation (starting in 10th grade). Based on the coefficients from the 10th, 11th,

12th grade continuation rate and high school graduation rate regressions, I estimate that a 10

percentage point increase in 1960%black was associated with an additional increase in average

black educational attainment of 0.05 year for those cohorts represented in the “after” years.38

The average cohort in the in the “after” period was exposed to higher levels of funding for

3.5 years. Thus, $595 of additional spending39 (3.5 X $170 per pupil per year) corresponded

to 0.05 additional years of educational attainment. Estimates from the literature on returns to

schooling suggest that an additional year of education raises wages by 8-12 percent; I use an

37 This is similar to an instrumental variables approach, regressing the change in educational attainment on the
change in per-pupil revenue, using initial black enrollment share to instrument for per-pupil revenue. Because
there are other channels through which black enrollment share may have affected outcomes—most important,
changes in black exposure to whites depended on initial black enrollment share—I do not take an IV approach.
38 See Appendix B for the details of the cost benefit calculation this section.
39 Technically, the present discounted value of spending should be used. At reasonable discount rates,

discounting will have little effect over such short time periods.


                                                    - 27 -
intermediate value of 10 percent. According to the 1970 Census, black Louisianans between

the ages of 20 and 50 with 10-12 years of education (but no high school degree) had annual

average wages around $9,700 (in CPI-adjusted 2003 dollars).40 Based on these assumptions

and assuming a 5 percent discount rate, the net present value of additional wages surpasses

the $595 increase in spending after 17 years in the labor force.

         This calculation is necessarily rough, requiring many assumptions. The benefits of

desegregation policy are potentially significantly underestimated, primarily because higher

wages due to increased educational attainment were not the only benefits of the policy, and

there may have been costs not captured here (for example, to whites). Still, the additional

spending appears to have been “worth it.” Evidence is mounting that education has

beneficial effects on outcomes other than wages, in particular, health and criminality.41 In

addition, the quality of education for blacks likely rose as well, so blacks who did not change

their attainment may also have seen benefits. On the other hand, this study has not been able

to account for the effects of desegregation on whites. In previous work (Reber 2006), I find

that funding and student-teacher ratios were “leveled up” to the level previously experienced

by whites; this is suggestive that whites were “held harmless” in resources allocated to their

schools, and we would not expect large effects on educational attainment and quality for

whites through that channel. Still, the overall effect of desegregation on whites could be

positive or negative.

         Little is known about how desegregation affected school finances in other states, so

it is difficult to assess whether the mechanism that operated in Louisiana to bring up school

spending and black educational attainment after desegregation operated in other parts of the

$15,000.

country. Margo (1990) estimates that Louisiana had one of the largest state-wide black-white

school spending gaps among Southern states in 1950. This suggests that by the time of

desegregation, other states may not have had as large a black-white quality gap to close, so

there may have been less scope for improvement in blacks’ outcomes through the

mechanisms shown here.

        The findings here are consistent with Guryan’s (2004) results that implementation of

a court-ordered desegregation plan reduced black dropout rates. Using a different

methodology and different source of variation than that employed in earlier studies, I find

evidence that desegregation improved educational attainment for blacks. The results

presented here contribute to the growing literature suggesting that the policies designed to

equalize educational opportunities of blacks and whites around the middle of the century—

including desegregation—contributed to improved outcomes for their intended

beneficiaries.

          Appendix A: Data Sources and Imputation of Segregation Measures

A. Data Sources

Louisiana Administrative Data

        The Annual Financial and Statistical Report is published annually by the Louisiana

Department of Education. The following variables were collected at the district level for

1960-1975 school years (all years refer to the fall of the school year): total black fall

registration in public and nonpublic schools, total white fall registration in public and

nonpublic registration, total revenue, total black classroom teachers in public schools, and

total white classroom teachers in public schools.

        To create the continuation rate variables (the outcome of interest), I also collected

black registration in public and nonpublic schools for each grade for the 1956 to 1975

school years, as well as the number of high school graduates. (The analysis is restricted to

1960-1975, but in order to construct the 12th grade continuation and high school graduation

rate, data on the number of 8th graders 4 years prior is required, so I employ data on

registration by grade starting in 1956.) To account for the possibility of movement between

public and private schools in the same district, I use the sum of public and nonpublic

registration by grade to calculate the continuation rates (although few blacks were enrolled in

private schools).

        Data on student-teacher ratios at the school level are not available before 1970.

However, according to the Southern Education Reporting Service, students and teachers

were completely segregated by race through 1965 (white teachers did not teach in black

schools and vice-versa). Thus, the average student-teacher ratio for the district is the total

number of black students in the district divided by the total number of black teachers in the

district. Student-teacher ratios by race for later years are calculated from Office of Civil



                                               - 32 -
Rights (OCR) data. The OCR data (described below) contain information on the number of

teachers in every school, as well as the number of black students and the total number of

students. To calculate the black student-teacher ratio for 1970-1972, I calculated the student-

teacher ratio (total students, any race, divided by total teachers, any race) in every school; I

then calculated the weighted average student-teacher ratio for schools in each district, with

black enrollment in the school as weights.

         Per-pupil revenue is total revenue received by the district divided by total public

registration (black and white).

Preexisting County Characteristics and Voter Registration

         The percent of households with complete plumbing and the percent of the

population living in urban areas at the county level, originally from the county tabulations of

the 1960 Census, were taken from the City and County Databook. Nonwhite median income

and the nonwhite median years of education were collected by Matthews and Prothro

(1963a, 1963b), also from county tabulations of the 1960 Census. The percent of the black

voting-aged population (VAP) registered to vote in 1960, 1964 and 1968 were collected by

Matthews and Prothro from reports of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

Employment

         Information on employment by county was taken from County Business Patterns for

1964 and 1970-1975. The variable Ln Change in Employment is the average of the natural log of

employment in 1970 through 1975 less the natural log of employment in 1964 (the only year

in the “before” period for which data are available).

Educational attainment by state of birth

         To estimate the share of cohorts of students attending 10th through 12th grade in

1960 to 1975, I use the 1980 Census IPUMS. Individuals were assigned to the state in which



                                                 - 33 -
they were born. Cohorts are identified by the school year in which they are expected to have

been in the relevant grade. For example, an individual who is expected to have entered 12th

grade in the 1965-66 school year is assigned to the 1965 cohort for the 12th grade ratio, 1964

for the 11th grade ratio, and 1963 for the 10th grade ratio. Individuals are assigned to a cohort

based on their quarter and year of birth, assuming they entered 1st grade if they would have

been 6 at the end of the 3rd quarter (individuals born in the 4th quarter are assigned to the

following school year) and assuming they do not repeat grades.

B. Sources of Data on Segregation and Imputation Methods

        I use data from the Southern Education Reporting Service’s (SERS) Statistical

Summary, State by State, of School Segregation-Desegregation in the Southern and Border Area from 1954

to the Present and surveys conducted by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Office of

Education to estimate the measures of segregation for Louisiana school districts from 1960-

1976. The exposure of blacks to whites is the percent white in schools, weighted by black

enrollment and vice-versa for exposure of whites to blacks; data on racial composition at the

school level are required to calculate these indexes. I obtained the original binary EBCDIC data

files for the OCR surveys for 1968-1974 and 1976 (the survey was not conducted in 1975)

and converted the files to ASCII for analysis. Similar school-level data on students and

teachers by race were published for 1967 by the Office of Education; these data were

entered for analysis. The exposure indexes where then calculated based on the school-level

enrollment by race.

        The OCR surveys were not comprehensive in all years, but the large size of

Louisiana’s school districts and the heavy involvement of the courts in desegregating its

schools ensured that most Louisiana districts were included in the data in most years. Of the




                                                - 34 -
66 districts in Louisiana, 45 were included in the 1967 survey, 61 in the 1969 survey, and all

of the districts were included in the remaining years.

        Before the 1967 school year, no school-level data on enrollment by race are available,

but the Southern Education Reporting Service monitored desegregation efforts in Southern

and Border states including Louisiana and reported on their findings in the Statistical

Summaries. In some issues, the percent of blacks in school with any whites is listed at the

district level for districts with any desegregation activity. Desegregation in this period generally

took the form of a small number of black students enrolling in white schools. At low levels

of desegregation of this form, the percent of blacks in school with whites provides an upper

bound of exposure of blacks to whites. For example, consider a district that has one black

school and one white school, each with half the total enrollment in the district. If 1 percent

of blacks are moved to the white school, 1 percent of blacks are in a school that is 50/51 or

98 percent white, while 99 percent of blacks are in school with 0 percent white. Thus, the

exposure of blacks to whites is (0.98 × .01) + (0.99 × 0) = 0.0098 or 0.98 percent. My

method assumes that black exposure to whites is 1 percent; as the percent of blacks in

school with any white increases and the percent black in the district increases, this method

will overestimate exposure of blacks to whites more. The highest percent of blacks in school

with any whites reported in the data is 5.5 percent. The small increase in black exposure to

whites before 1966 represents an upper bound on the true increase in exposure.

        The SERS publication only listed the percent of blacks in school with any whites for

districts where there was at least some desegregation activity. The publication covering the

1964-65 school year appears to have complete coverage for districts with any desegregation;

the Office of Education contracted with SERS to conduct a more complete accounting of

the status of desegregation in that year, following the passage of the Civil Rights Act (CRA).


                                                 - 35 -
I therefore assume that any district that is not listed as having any blacks in school with

whites in 1964 had no desegregation in earlier years and set exposure of blacks to whites to 0

for those years. In Louisiana, only 3 districts had any blacks in school with whites, with an

average of about 2 percent of blacks in school with any whites. For 1966, SERS reported the

number of blacks in school with whites; to estimate the percent in school with whites, I

divided this by the number of blacks reported in the district in the 1967 OCR data if

available. If a district is not listed as having any blacks in school with whites in 1966, black

exposure to whites is set to 0 for 1966 and all previous years.

        White exposure to blacks is not estimated from the SERS data, but the small

numbers of blacks in school with whites indicates that this was also quite low before 1967.

The trends presented in Figure 1 look similar if the sample is limited to districts that had

data available in all years.

                             Appendix B: Cost-Benefit Analysis

Change in Revenue

        The financial cost associated with desegregation is the additional revenue required to

“level up” spending in integrated schools to the level previously experienced in the white

schools. Because districts with high black enrollment shares traditionally had larger black-

white spending gaps, spending had to increase more in high black enrollment share districts.

In order to quantify the differential increase in revenue for high black enrollment share

districts, I estimate equation (2) with per pupil revenue on the left-hand-side. The

coefficient on 1960%black is 1.7, indicating that a 10 percentage point increase in initial black

enrollment share was associated with an additional $170 increase in per-pupil revenue

between the before period (1960-1965) and the after period (1970-1975). The number of

years that individuals were exposed to additional funding varied by year in the after period:

observations in 1970 were exposed to increased funding for one year, observations in 1971

were exposed to two years, and so on. The average observation in the after period was

therefore exposed to (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5 years of increased funding. Thus, a ten

percentage point increase in 1960%black was associated with an increase in cumulative

average spending for cohorts in the “after” period of $170 X 3.5 = $595.

Change in Educational Attainment

        In this analysis, I only consider the benefits of higher wages due to increased

educational attainment. The educational benefits to blacks, therefore, are likely to be

significantly underestimated. The estimates in Table 3 indicate the differential change in the

share of students who attain at least 9th grade, 10th grade, 11th grade and high school




                                              - 37 -
graduation.42 I am interested in the change in average years of completed education, which is

calculated as follows.

         Because the estimates of the effects of desegregation on attainment focus on changes

in 9th grade through high school graduation, for simplicity, I assume that everyone in the

population attains at least 8th grade and not more than 12th grade. (Attainment outside of

these ranges will difference out when I estimate changes in attainment due to desegregation

policy.) The average education of the population is

                   12
(A1)      educ = ∑ t × pt ,
                   t =8


where pt is the share of the population attaining exactly t years of education. Let q t be the

share of the population that attains at least t years of education, then q t = pt + q t +1 . If

everyone attains at least 8 and not more than 12 years (high school graduation), then q8 = 1

and q12 = p12 . Substituting into (A1):

(A2)      educ = 8 (1 − q 9 ) + 9 (q 9 − q 10 ) + 10 (q 10 − q 11 ) + 11 (q 11 − q 12 ) + 12 (q 12 )

          educ = 8 + q 9 + q10 + q11 + q12

The change in educational attainment is therefore:

(A3)      Δ educ = Δq9 + Δq10 + Δq11 + Δq12

The coefficients on 1960%black give the differential change in the q’s. The differential

change in average educational attainment is therefore the sum of the differential changes in

attaining at least 9, 10, 11, and 12 years, the coefficients on 1960%black for 10th, 11th, and 12th




42 Note that the 10th grade registration rate is the share of 8th graders who registered for 10th grade in the fall; I

consider this to be a close proxy for the number of students who completed at least 9th grade; the 11th grade
registration rate is the share that completed at least 10th grade, the 12th grade registration rate is the share that
competed 11th grade; the High School Graduation rate is the share that completed at least 12th grade.

grade registration and high school graduation, respectively.43 Using the second set of

estimates from Table 3 (controlling for lower grade registration rates)44, average educational

attainment for blacks in a district that was 100 percent black would have risen by 0.040 +

0.132 + 0.191 + 0.184 = 0.547 years more than a district that was all white. Thus, a 10

percentage point increase in initial black enrollment share is associated with an additional

increase in educational attainment of about 0.05 years during the period of desegregation.

Return to Education

         Estimates from the literature on returns to schooling suggest that an additional year

of education raises wages by 8-12 percent; I use an intermediate value of 10 percent.45

According to the 1970 Census, black Louisianans between the ages of 20 and 50 with 10-12

years of education (but no high school degree) had annual average wages around $9,700 (in

CPI-adjusted 2003 dollars).46 Based on these assumptions and assuming a 5 percent discount

rate, the net present value of additional wages surpasses the $595 increase in spending after

17 years in the labor force. See the main text for further discussion of the limits of this

analysis.




43 I consider a student who registered for 10th grade to have attained 9 years of education, those who registered
for 11th grade to have attained 10 years, and so on.
44 I use the point estimates even where they are not statistically significantly different from zero.
45 See Card (2001) for a review of the literature on returns to schooling.
46 This estimate includes blacks with 0 wages; the average wages among those who are working is nearly

$15,000.

Notes: Author’s calculations. Left panel shows the average gap between the student-teacher ratio for blacks and whites for 1960 to
1965 versus 1960 black enrollment share (based on Annual Financial and Statistical Report). Right panel shows the average gap between
the student-teacher ratios for blacks and whites for 1970 and 1972 (based on Office of Civil Rights Survey). Data on student-teacher
ratios by race is not available for other years between 1970 and 1975.

             desegregation. Black exposure to white is the white share of enrollment in the average black’s school. Right panel shows the change

             some years, and black exposure to whites before desegregation was estimated from the percent of blacks in school with any whites
             (see Appendix A for details).
