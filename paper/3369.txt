                     EFFICIENT WINDOWS AND LABOR FORCE REDUCTION


                                       ABSTRACT

     Recently many U.S. firma have offered "window" plans that provide bonuses

to a group of workers if the worker retires within a specified short time

span. This paper examines a window plan at a Fortune 500 firm, and addresses

two main issues. First, what was the effect of the window plan on departures?

Second, assuming a variety of possible firm objectives, what would be the

design of an efficient window plan? These questions are addressed using the

retirement model in Stock and Wise [l988a, l988b] .   The model, estimated using

data for an earlier year, predicts well out-of-sample the subsequent large

increase in retirements under the window plan. We find that while the firm

successfully msximized departures, if its goal was to minimize either expected

future wage payments or the current cost per induced retirement, the firm

could have saved more with efficient plans constructed using the model. One

interpretation is that the firm was primarily interested in reducing the

overall size of the labor force or in retiring older employees to allow

promotion of younger employees.

     In recent years many U.S. firms have offered "window" plans that provide

incentives for older workers to retire early. Window plans provide special

bonuses to a specific group of workers -     - often   defined by age, occupational

group, or even a division within the firm -     - if the worker retires within a
specified period of time, typically a year or less. The apparent goal of such

plans is either to reduce the salary cost of older employees or to reduce the

size of the older labor force, possibly without primary concern for total

labor cost. Some firm executives emphasize that by inducing employees in

higher level positions to retire such plans can enhance promotion

possibilities for younger employees. Others emphasize that such plans are a

convenient way to reduce the overall size of the workforce without resorting

to layoffs. Another possibility is that firms use the window plan to induce

older workers to retire because their salaries would exceed their marginal

products, were they to continue working. This is in line with the theoretical

proposition of Lazear (1979] ,   that   defined benefit pension plans serve this

purpose in general. The window plan might be an additional inducement

motivated by the same goal. With these possible goals in mind, this paper

considers the potential effects of "optimal" window plans. To focus the

discussion and to demonstrate the effects of window plans, the analysis is

 applied to the experience of a large Fortune 500 firm. We consider whether

 the window plan in this firm was as efficient as it could have been; was there

 another plan that could have done the job better?

      The analysis relies on the option value model developed in earlier
                                                                              papers
 [Stock and Wise 1988a and 1988b] and used to analyze the retirement incentives

of defined benefit pension plans. About 50 percent of workers in the United

States have firm pension plans. Approximately 75 percent of these are covered

by defined benefit plansj The typical defined benefit pension plan provides

substantial incentive for workers to retire early, often as young as 55. Most

window plans can be treated as temporary changes in the provisions of firm

pension plans.

     Firm pension plan coverage expanded quickly in the late 1940's and the

1950's, after 1942 legislation that made contributions to pension funds tax

deductible. Although totsl coverage has not changed much in recent years, the

proportion of workers that retires with a firm plan is still increasing. The

rapid increase of pension plan coverage has been accompanied by a dramatic

decrease in the labor force participation of older workers, as shown by the

following data for men:

                 Year           50-54       55-59       60-64          65+

     1The others are covered by defined contribution plans. Under these
plans, the pension benefit is determined by contributions to the firm pension
fund, which are in turn usually set at a percentage of salary earnings.
Defined contribution plans typically have none of the incentive effects of
defined benefit plans, as described below.
                                      (3)


The juxtaposition of these two trends suggests that the quantitative effects

on retirement of firm pension plan provisions may have been substantial.

     The incentive effects of these plans have been emphasized in several

recent papers. Bulow (1981] described pension wealth accrual under such plans

and Lazear [1983] emphasized the potential role of plan provisions in inducing

early retirement as a substitute for mandatory retirement. The very

substantial incentive effects of these plans have been emphasized most

recently by Kotlikoff and Wise [1985, 1987, 1989], who summarize the

incentives of approximately 2500 plans covered by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics Level of Benefits Survey and consider in detail the effects of the

provisions of the same Fortune 500 firm whose data is used in this paper.

This work demonstrates that the typical firm plan provides a large reward for

remaining with the firm until some age, often the early retirement age, and

then a substantial inducement to leave the firm, often as early as 55. Almost

all plans incorporate a large penalty for working past age 65. The gain in

wage earnings from working an additional year is often offset in large part by

a loss in the present value of future pension benefits.

     An early analysis of firm retirement is presented in Burkhauser [1979].

Fields and Mitchell (1982] also consider the incentive effects of firm plans.

Hogarth [1988) analyzes the acceptance of an early retirement bonus. The

immediate antecedent of our work is Lazear and Moore [1988], who argue that

the option value of postponing retirement is the appropriate variable to enter

in a regression equation explaining retirement.2 The analysis by Stock and



     2lndeed it was their work and analysis of military retirement rates by
Phillips and Wise [1987] that motivated the Stock and Wise option value
approach.

Wise [l988a and l988b) formalizes an option value model of retirement and

demonstrates that these plans do indeed have a powerful effect on employee

retirement decisions. Based on data from the Fortune 500 firm used in this

paper, they showed that increasing the age of early retirement from 55 to 60,

for example, would increase by 35 percent the proportion of persons employed

at 50 who are still employed by the firm at age 60. They also showed that

changes in Social Security provisions would have little effect on retirement

rates in this firm, largely because most firm employees have retired before

the Social Security early and normal retirement ages, 62 and 65 respectively.

     This paper uses the option value model to examine the potential effect of

window plans. To understand the effect of these plans, it is first necessary

to understand the retirement incentive implications of the firm's permanent

pension plan. A brief description of the firm plan, borrowed in large part

from Stock and Vise [l988a], is presented in section I. The model that is

used to analyze retirement is summarized in section II. To support the

subsequent selection of optimal window plans, two results are emphasized:

first, the firm's window plan dramatically increased firm departure rates,

and, second, the option value retirement model predicts well these very large

increases in retirement rates. In addition to the choice of an optimal window

plan, the central focus of this paper, the firm window allows a unique

external test of the predictive validity of the retirement -model; we compare

our predictions against actual retirement rates under the window plan.3 The

model is first estimated for male non-managerial office employees, using data

for 1980, a year in which no window plan was available. The model is then



     3More detail on this aspect of the analysis, which is only summarized in
this paper, is presented in Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise [1989].
                                       (5)



used to predict the effect of the window plan that was offered two years

later, in 1982. This firm had not offered previous window plans and according

to firm executives the 1982 plan was unanticipated by employees. Thus

prediction of departure rates under the plan provides a true out-of-sample

test of the predictive validity of the model.4 The results show that the

model predicts well the effects of the window plan adopted by the firm. We

then consider in section III how an "optimal' plan could be designed, and what

the effects of such a plan would be.

     Although to motivate the analysis we consider how well the firm's plan

worked relative to potential alternative plans with similar characteristics,

the primary intent is to demonstrate that window plans can be a powerful

managerial tool with strong incentive effects, and to demonstrate how such

plans could be designed. The provisions of optimal plans are chosen in

accordance with the parameter estimates of the retirement model.

     The firm's plan was apparently chosen on the basis of educated hunches of

firm personnel. In contrast, we choose an "optimal" plan based on our

estimated model of retirement behavior, together with an objective function.

We find that an optimal plan chosen to minimize expected future salaries paid

to older employees could have saved much more than the firms plan, measured

by reduction in salaries per bonus dollar. Thus if this were its goal, the

firm could have chosen a more efficient mechanism to achieve it. We also show

that an optimal plan could reduce substantially the current cost of the window

plan per induced retirement. Although the results provide no direct evidence

on the motivation of the firm in initiating a window plan, the analysis



     4The estimates in the earlier Stock-Wise papers were based on salesmen,
who were not eligible for the window plan.

supports some qualified conclusions about possible motivations for such plans.

Section IV is a summary.




I.   The Firm Pension Plan and The Temporary Window.

     A. The Firm Pension Plan.

     The analysis is based on male (non-managerial) office employees who are

at least 50 years old and have been employed for at least three years.5 The

data reflect the retirement behavior of a random sample of 1000 employees who

were in the firm on January 1, 1980. The data, obtained from firm personnel

records, follow these employees through 1985. Individual earnings histories

are available beginning in 1969, or from the date of hire if the employee was

hired after 1969.

     To understand the effect of the pension plan provisions, figure 1 shows

the expected future compensation of a person from our sample who is 50 years

old and has been employed by the firm for 20 years.6 It is important to

consider total compensation --   including   wage earnings, the accrual of pension

benefits, and the accrual of Social Security benefits. As compensation for

working another year the employee receives salary earnings. He also receives

compensation in the form of future pension benefits. The annual compensation

in this form is the change in the present value of the future pension benefits

entitlement, due to working an additional year. This accrual is comparable to



     5The criterion that they be employed three years facilitates the
forecasting of future wage earnings on an individual basis.

     6The graphs assume a 5 percent real discount rate and zero inflation. In
the empirical model that is estimated, the discount rate is estimated and the
inflation rate is assumed to be 5 percent.
                                          (7)



wage earnings. The accrual of Social Security benefits also may be calculated

in a similar manner, and is also comparable to wage earnings. Figure 1 shows

the present value at age 50 of expected future compensation in all three

forms. The line labelled wage earnings represents cumulated earnings, by age

of retirement.7 For example, if the person were to retire at age 62, his

cumulated earnings between age 50 and age 62, discounted to age 50 dollars

would be about $126,000. (All dollar amounts are in 1980 dollars.) The slope

of the earnings line represents annual earnings discounted to age 50 dollars.

     The solid line shows the accrual of firm pension plus Social Security

benefits, again discounted to age 50 dollars. The shape of this profile is

determined primarily by the pension plan provisions. The plan's normal

retirement age is 65 and the early retirement age is 55. Cliff vesting occurs

at ten years of service.8 Normal retirement benefits at age 65 are determined

by age times years of service, times a multiplier. The most important

additional provisions - -   those   that determine the shape of the profile in

figure 1 --   are described here.9 The present value of retirement benefits

increases between 50 and 54 because years of service, and possibly earnings,

increase. If a vested employee were to leave the firm at age 53, for example,

he would be entitled to normal retirement pension benefits at age 65, based on

his years of service and current dollar earnings at age 53. He could start to



     7Departure from the firm would be a more accurate description than
retirement, because for some employees the alternative to continued employment
at the firm may to be another job, rather than retirement.

     8That is, an employee has no pension entitlement before 10 years of
service, when he becomes entitled to full benefits determined by the pension
formula.

     9Full details of the plan provisions are presented in Kotlikoff and Wise
[1987).
                                       (8)



receive benefit payments as early as age 55, the pension early retirement age,

but the benefit amount would be reduced actuarially. Thus in present value

terms, the stream of benefits received beginning at 55 would be equal to the

stream of benefits beginning at 65; the annual benefit amount would be reduced

just enough to offset the receipt of benefits for ten more years. If he

started to receive benefits at age 55, they would be only 36 percent of the

dollar amount he would receive at age 65. If, however, he were to remain in

the firm until the early retirement age, the situation would be quite

different. He would be entitled to normal retirement benefits based on his

years of service and salary at age 55. But if he were to start to receive

them at age 55 the benefits would be reduced less than actuarially, about 3

percent for each year that retirement precedes age 65 instead of the actuarial

rate of 6 or 7 percent.

     The plan also has a Social Security offset provision. Pension benefits

are offset by a specified amount, depending on the firm estimate of Social

Security benefits. But if the person takes early retirement, between 55 and

65, the Social Security offset is not applied to benefits received before age

65. These two provisions create the large discontinuous jump in retirement

benefits at age 55 --   from about $30,000 to $50,000. This increase is

equivalent to more than 150 percent of his annual wage earnings at 55. Thus

there is an enormous bonus for remaining with the firm until that age. After

age 55, however, the person who does not retire foregoes the opportunity of

taking pension benefits on very advantageous terms; thus there is only a

small change in the discounted value of benefits between 55 and 60.

     If a person has 30 years of service at age 60, he is entitled to full

normal retirement benefits. No early retirement reduction is applied to
                                            (9)


benefits if they are taken then. That is, by continuing to work after age 60

he will no longer gain from fewer years of early retirement reduction, as he

did before age 60.         Thus the kink in the profile and the decline thereafter.

       The top line shows total compensation. For example, if the employee were

to leave the firm at age 60, his wage earnings between 50 and 60 would be

$114,000, shown by the wage earnings line. Thereafter, he would receive firm

pension plan and Social Security retirement benefits with a present value -       -

at   age 50 - -   of   about $45,000. The sum of the two is about $159,000, shown by

the top line. The large jump at 55 reflects the early retirement provisions

of the pension plan. Total annual compensation declines modestly each year

through age 60 and very rapidly thereafter. After age 62 or 63, total annual

compensation is close to zero. The plot ends at age 70, which was the

mandatory retirement age in this firm over the period of our analysis.


       B. The Window Plan

       In 1982 the firm introduced a window plan for all non-managerial office

employees. The window plan applied to all employees 55 and older who were

vested in the firm's pension plan. Employees in this age group who retired in

1982 received a bonus, depending on age and years of service. The approximate

number of bonus months is shown in table i.10 The bonus was typically

smallest for the youngest and for the oldest employees and largest for those

who were between 58 and 62 years old.




     10The approximation is obtained from the parameterization of bonus plans
used to choose optimal windows. It is discussed below. To avoid potential
identification of the firm, we do not show the actual plan values.
                                           (10)


II. The Option Value Model, Parameter Estimates, and Predictive Validity.

     A. The Model.

     The conceptual model is discussed in detail in Stock and Wise [1988a]

It is described only briefly here. At any given age, based on information

available at that age, we assume that an employee compares the expected value

of retiring at that age with the value of retiring at each age in the future,

through age 70. The difference between the value of immediate retirement

versus the maximum of the values at each future age represents an opportunity

cost of retirement; we refer to it as the option value of postponing

retirement. A person who does not retire this year maintains the option of

retiring at a more advantageous age later on. If the option value is greater

than zero, the person Continues to work; otherwise he retires. With reference

to figure 1, for example, at age 50 the employee would compare the value of

the retirement benefits that he would receive were he to retire then - -

approximately   $24,000 -.   with   the value of wage earnings and retirement

benefits in each future year. The expected value at 60, for example, is about

$159,000. The same calculation is repeated in successive years, using updated

predictions of future wage earnings, and related pension and Social Security

benefits. Future earnings forecasts are based on the individual's past

earnings, as well as the earnings of other persons in the firm.        The precise
model specification follows.

    A person at age t who continues to work will earn Y5 in subsequent years

s. If the person retires at age r, subsequent retirement benefits will be

          We suppose that in deciding whether to retire the person weighs the



     11These benefits will depend on the person's age and years of service at
retirement and on his earnings history; thus they are a function of the
retirement age.

indirect utility that will be received from future income. Discounted at the

rate P.    the   value of this future stream of income if retirement is at age r is

given by



(1)          V(r) —    X85tUw(ys)        +



where U(Y5) is the indirect utility of future wage income and Ur(Bs(r)) is

the indirect utility of future retirement benefits. The person will not live

past age S.

        The person will postpone retirement at age t if the option value -      - the
gain from postponing retirement -        - is   greater than zero, that is if



(2)          Gt(r*) —   EtVt(r*)   -
                                       EtV(t)   > 0



where r* is the age that gives the maximum gain.

        The utilities of future wage and retirement income are assumed to be

The parameter k is to recognize that in considering whether to retire the

utility associated with a dollar of income while retired may be different from

the utility associated with a dollar of income accompanied by work.

       Given this specification, the function Gt(r) can be decomposed into two

components



(5)         G(r) —    g(r)     +


where g(r) and (r) distinguish the terms in G(r) containing the random

effects, w and , from the other terms. They are given by

(Gb)         t(r) —   rlfistZ(SIt)E(W)

where 1r(slt) denotes the probability that the person will be alive in year s,

given that he is alive in year t. Given the random Markov assumption, (r)

can be written as

                   — Kt(r)v

where K(r) —        rl(flp)st,r(sIt)   and      —   -    Thus G(r) can by

written as



(8)          G(r) —    g(r)   +



       If the person is to retire in year t, G(r) must be less than zero for

every potential retirement age r in the future. If rt is the r that yields

the maximum value of g(r)/K(r). the probability of retirement becomes



(9)          Pr[Retire in year t} —     Pr[g(rt)/K(rt)   < vt]


Consistent with equation (4), v5 follows a first order autoregressive process

that we assume to be Gaussian. Thus

whether to retire, a dollar of income while retired is given more weight than

a dollar of income while working. The ratio of the utility of retirement to

the utility of employment is [l.483(8/Y)J'523. It is 1 when 8/1 —    0.67.   The

real discount rate is estimated at .014. This is an unusually low estimate,

based on our experience to date with this modelj4

     Alternative specifications were also estimated but are not reported here.

the data better than the specification reported above, simulations like those

reported below are not appreciably affected. 15


     C. The Model Fit.

     To evaluate the model fit, the predicted versus actual retirement rates

are shown in figure 2. The first panel of the figure shows the proportion of

persons employed at age 50 who still would be in the firm at subsequent ages,



     13Logarithmic utility is clearly rejected by the data, based on the Wald
statistic.

     14Eatimated discount rates for salesmen have typically been above .15.
Thua we do not at this stage of our work attach much significance to the exact
rate estimated here.

     15For more detail on these other specifications see Lumsdaine, Stock, and
Wise [19891.

based on the annual retirement (hazard) rates that are shown in the bottom

panel of the figure.16 In general the model fits the data rather well. There

are two exceptions: It overpredicts the hazard rates between 56 and 59; thus

the cumulative rates in subsequent years, as shown in the top panel, are

somewhat overpredicted between 55 and 65. And, the retirement rate at 65, is

substantially underpredicted. Although the small sample size at age 65 does

not support strong conclusions based on these estimates alone, our experience

with other employee groups suggests that the model typically underpredicts age

65 retirement rates. As can be seen in figure 1, wage earnings and retirement

income do not suggest an abrupt jump in retirement at 65     as compared to the

jump that the figure suggests at 55. Most employees in this firm have retired

before 65, so the effect on overall retirement of the hazard rate at 65 is

small. Nonetheless, these results and the results of our prior estimation all

point to a "customary retirement effect" or a "Social Security retirement

effect" at age 65, and possibly at age 62 as well, that is not due to an

abrupt change in wage earnings or retirement income at that particular age.17



     16The "actual" values in the bottom panel in figure 2 were computed as
the fraction of workers in each age group who retired in 1980. The
"predicted" values were computed from the estimated model. The cumulative
hazard in the top part of figure 2 was computed by cumulating the annual
hazards in the bottom panel using the formula hi — 1 -
                                                         II1(lf) where f is
the annual hazard in the bottom half of the figure for ge j and i runs over
ages. The annual and cumulative hazards presented in figures 3 through 9 were
computed analogously. The data that correspond to figures 2, 3, and 4 are
shown in Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise [1989].

     17The "actual" rates - - the sample rates - - are of course only estimates
themselves. Except at age 65, the predicted rates always lie within a 95
percent confidence band (for the true rates) around the "actual" sample rates.
Lunisdaine, Stock, and Wise [1989] show that the fit is somewhat better when k
is parameterized as a function of age. The utility function (kB(r))l can be
interpreted as the utility associated with a dollar of income while retired.
Maintaining this interpretation, its value might be expected to rise with age,
not because the dollar itself is worth more but because retirement is.
Holding income constant, retirement (leisure) may be increasingly desired as
the person ages. To capture this possibility, k was parametrized as k —
+                                                                          k0/[l
  exp(-k1(A-k2))]. Recalling the ratio of the utilities of retirement to

     D. Predictive Validity.

     The simulated effect of the 1982 window plan is shown in figure 3.     The

base case represents the simulated rates under the usual plan provisions. The

simulated retirement rates under the window plan exceed those in the absence

of the plan by almost two fold in some instances. For example the simulated

hazard rate at age 60 is .193 without the window plan and .364 with it. Of

persons employed at age 52, about 52 percent retire by age 60 under the normal

plan; with the window plan in effect, almost 79 percent are estimated to

retire by age 60, an increase of over 50 percent.18

     In order of magnitude, the effect of the window plan is comparable to the

effect of changing the plan early retirement age, a key feature of the pension

plan. Whereas almost 49 percent of persons employed at 50 leave the firm

before age 60 with the early retirement age at 55 (based on the estimates for

1980), only about 35 percent would leave before 60 if the early retirement age

were at age 60, a reduction of about 28 percent. Similarly, were the early

retirement age at 60, a reduction to 55 would increase by about 39 percent the

proportion that would leave before age 60.19 Thus the window plan magnifies

the already large effect of the pension plan early retirement provisions.



employment, [k(35/Y5))', if k is very small retirement will be unlikely even
if B/Y is large; if k is large retirement is likely even if B/Y is small. The
results suggest an increasing desire for retirement leisure with age.

     18Because the youngest person in the 1982 sample is 52, the cumulative
calculations start at that age. In figure 3 we have adjusted the 1982 data by
using the age 50 and age 51 retirement rates from 1980 and 1981.

     19The details of these calculations are reported in Lumsdaine, Stock, and
Vise [1989].
                                      (17)


     A natural way to aasess the predictive validity of the model is to

consider the extent to which the predicted (i.e. simulated) retirement rstes

agree with the actual rates under the window plan. The evidence is shown in

figure 4. As a reminder of the extent to which the window plan changed the

typical retirement behavior, the actual 1981 retirement rates are also shown.

The top panel of the figure summarizes the results. It is evident from a

comparison of the 1981 and 1982 rates that the effect of the window plan on

retirement was substantial. The window plan was not announced prior to its

effective date. Thus there should have been no anticipation of it, leading to

reduced retirement in 1981 while waiting for the more favorable 1982 terms.20

Thus a good external test of the predictive validity of the model is its

ability to predict actual retirement rates in 1982, rates that were much

different than they would have been without the window plan. In general the

correspondence between the actual and predicted rates is rather close. The

simulated proportion of those employed at age 50 who would retire by age 60

under the window plan almost matches the actual proportion, .795 versus .770

respectively. The simulated results, however, overpredict annual retirement

rates from 55 to 58 and underpredict for older ages. This can be seen clearly

in the annual hazard rates reported in the bottom panel of the figure.

     The parameter estimates for men were also used to predict the effect of

the window plan on women. Although not shown here, the prediction for women,

based on the parameter estimates for men, seems to match the actual retirement

experience of women better than the predictions for men match their actual



     20The 1981 retirement rates are essentially the same as those in 1980 and
these are in turn virtually the same as those in 1983, the year after the
window plan.

experience. In summary, the model clearly captures the pattern and magnitude

of the effects of the window plan, but underpredicts somewhat the effect on

the small proportion of employees that would otherwise remain in the firm at

older ages.



III. "Optimal" Window Plan.

     It is clear from the discussion above that the window plan in this firm

had a dramatic effect on retirement rates during the year that it was in

effect. Thus it is apparent that such bonus plans can be sn important

manpower management tool. We consider next the possibility of choosing an

efficient plan, based on mansgerial goals. To make the idea concrete, we

consider in particular whether in this firm the same outcomes could have been

achieved at less cost with an alternative window plan. To illustrate the

possible effects of larger bonuses and to motivate the possible advantages of

targeting certain groups of employees, we first simulate the effects of two

simple plans that provide the same bonus for all older employees.


     A. Six versus Twelve Month Bonuses for Everyone.

     The firm plan offered bonuses ranging from 3 to 12 months salary to

vested employees between 55 and 69. Suppose instead that each employee

between 55 and 69 were eligible for a bonus of six months salary if he were to

retire in 1982. The simulated effect of such a plan is shown in figure 5,

together with the simulated retirement rates with no window plan and with the

firm's plan. The figure also shows the simulated effect of offering each

employee a 12 month salary bonus. The effect of both the 6 and the 12 month

bonus plans is large, but the figure makes it clear that the increase in

retirement rates from the addition of the second 6 months is much less than
                                      (19)


 the increase from the first 6 months. A total of 55.7 retirements are induced

 by the six-month and 80.8 by the twelve-month plan, according to the

 simulations. (Without the window plan, 91.0 employees would retire; 146.7

 are estimated to retire under the 6-month and 171.8 under the 12-month bonus.)

 In both cases the relative increase in retirement rates is greater for
                                                                          younger
 than older employees. Thus, the illustration suggests that if the goal were

 to reduce the number of older employees, it would be best to target younger

rather than older workers in the 55 to 65 age group. Those closer to 65 have

high retirement rates with no bonus at all, and thus the marginal effect of

the bonus is smaller.


     B. Parameterizing the Window Plan.

     Like most window plans, the plan at this firm provided bonuses to a

rather broad group of employees. The amount of the bonus payment was

determined by age and years of service. A natural question is whether another

plan, offering a different schedule of payments, might be more efficient than

the firm's plan. For example, could another plan achieve the same results at

lower cost? In general, to find such a plan requires that a bonus be selected

for each age and years of service combination. While conceptually

straightforward, this direct approach is computationally cumbersome;

optimization is over a large number of parameters, given by the number of ages

times the possible number of years of service. We therefore adopt an

alternative approach based on parameterization of the schedule of bonus

payments by age and years of service. We use a variant of the beta

distribution to provide a flexible functional form that can describe a wide

range of possibilities. Months of bonus payment are given by
                                              (20)



(11)         Months —   f * r(,)r() [(1X-1)x-1]

where x — (age   -
                     55)/15.   The standard beta distribution is defined for

variable values between 0 and 1. The transformation of x allows age to range

from 55 (x — 0) to 70 (x —       I).    The maximum of 70 is chosen because the firm's

mandatory retirement age was 70. The central tendency of the density along

the age dimension is allowed to vary with years of service, by letting

  —      -            of   service -   55).   The parameter £ is a normalizing factor

that determines the overall level of payments. Alternative plans are defined

by different parameter values in equation (11).

         Because we use the "beta description" of the firm's plan as a base

case, we need to verify that the beta formulation can accurately approximate

that plan. The beta description of the firm's plan was obtained by fitting

the specification in equation (11) to the actual window plan payment schedule,

using least squares. Even though the firm's schedule varies discontinuously

by age and years of service, the approximation fits the actual schedule rather

closely. The root mean squared error of the predicted versus actual bonus for

employees with 10 to 40 years of service is 1.17 months of salary, less than

10 percent of the typical bonus. More important for our purposes, the

predicted departure rates using the actual firm bonus payments correspond

closely to the predicted rates using the beta summary          of   the firm's plan. The

cumulative and the annual hazard rates based on the actual and fitted payments

are shown in figure 6.


       C. Selecting Optimum      Plans.
       Whether a window plan is efficient depends, of course, on the goal of the

plan. In line with prominent explanations for such plans, we consider two
                                         (21)


 goals: one is to reduce the wage bill, through retirement of older workers;

 the other is to reduce the number of older employees, without particular

 concern for labor cost.

      1. Reducing Labor    Cost.
      Suppose that the firm wishes to reduce labor cost. We translate labor

 cost to mean the present discounted value of the expected future wage bill.

 We then select a window plan to minimize the future wages that the firm        would
 otherwise expect to pay to the firm's    current   older employees before they

 retire, plus the cost of the window plan bonus payments. Here, we consider

 only male non-managerial office employees. The criterion function is




        E_l[at+l/1*1)t5t Hj(tlaixj)Yi(tIsi,ai) +                      where
                                                               Cj],

           C — [1   -
                        H(aj+lIai,xi)] [M(ai,sj)j   [Yj(aj)/12].



Here, N is the number of employees (taken to be the 563 employees in our

sample who were employed on January 1, 1982), i indexes employees, a is age, r

is the discount rate (assumed to be 5 percent), H(tI) is the probability that

a person will still be employed at future ages t, x includes all of the

measured determinants of retirement including the window bonus, Y is predicted

future annual salary, and C is the expected window plan bonus payment. The

number of months of salary under the window plan is H.21           Minimization of

equation (12) is with respect to the beta function parameters in equation

(11), which in turn determine the bonus months H.



     21The forecasting of future salary is based on individual age, years of
service, and current salary, as well as the salaries of other firm employees.
The procedure is described in Stock and Wise [1988bJ.
                                      (22)


     The optimal plan bonus schedule is shown in table 2. For comparison, the

table also shows the beta approximation to the firm's plan. There are three

noticeable differences between the two. First, the optimal plan offers much

lower bonuses on average. This is consistent with the declining marginal

effect of additional bonus dollars on departure rates, illustrated in figure

5.   Second, the optimal plan offers the highest payments to younger employees.

Because younger employees could work for many more years, inducing them to

leave has the greatest effect on the expected future wage bill. Third, years

of service is not an important determinant of the bonus in the optimal plan.

     The actual firm plan costs $4.07 million and saves $6.42 million in

expected labor costs. Thus the reduction in future salary payment to the

older employees is offset in large part by the cost of the window plan itself;

the reduction in net labor coat is only $2.35 million. Were the firm's goal

to reduce labor cost, the simulations suggest that it could do much better

than this. The cost of the optimal window plan is only $2.91 million, yet it

aaves $6.08 million in expected salaries (95 percent of the salary reduction

achieved by the firm plan). The net labor coat reduction achieved by the

optimal plan is $3.17 million, almost 35 percent more than the reduction

achieved by firm plan. Even though the cost of the optimal window plan is

only 71 percent of the cost of the firm plan, it induces almost 95 percent as

many retirements 22



     22The optimal plans were determined using a modified simulated annealing
algorithm. This random search algorithm was adopted to avoid potential local
optima in choosing the plan parameters. For the cost minimizing plan, the
minimization of equation (12) was done without any constraints. To determine
the plan that induces the maximum number of retirements, and the plan that
maximizes the reduction in future employee years, it was necessary to impose
the inequality constraint that the total predicted coat of the optimal plan be
no greater than the predicted cost of the actual firm plan. This was achieved
by penalizing the objective function if the cost of the optimal plan exceeded
the firm plan cost.
                                     (23)


     The departure rates induced by the optimal Cost minimizing plan versus

the firm plan are shown in figure 7. Consistent with larger bonuses for the

older employees, the firm plan has a greater effect than the optimal plan on

the retirement rates of employees 58 and older.

     2. Inducing Retirements.

     The goal of the firm may be to reduce the number of older employees,

without major concern for the salaries that they would receive. It is clear

from the results above that the cost minimizing plan costs much less in bonus

payments per induced retirement than the firm's plan -- $19,152 versus

$25,046. This is due to the rapidly diminishing returns to marginal bonus

dollars with respect to induced retirement, as is made clear by the cost of

the six- versus twelve-month plans, shown at the bottom of table 3.

     In addition to the cost-minimizing plan, we selected a plan to maximize

the number of induced retirements, setting the plan cost equal to the cost of

the firm window plan (i.e. $4.07 million). As table 3 shows, the maximum

employment reduction is 163.7, only about 1 percent greater than the number of

retirements induced by the firm plan. This indicates that no reallocation of

the dollars that the firm spent could significantly increase the number of

retirements, although the cost per induced retirement could be much lower.

     3. Reducing Future Years of Employment.

    An alternative to inducing retirements is to reduce the number of future

years of employment by older workers. In effect, this weights each induced

retirement by the number of future years the person would have been expected

to work in the a1sence of the window plan. The plan that yields the maximum

reduction in future years of employment, setting the cost at the cost of the

firm window plan, reduces expected future employee years by 264.1 (from 1768.7
                                          (24)


to 1504.6). This is about 12 percent more than the reduction achieved by the

firm plan. Thus even though it is not possible to induce more retirements

than were induced by the firm plan --      given   the same plan cost - -   an   optimally

chosen plan could reduce future employee years somewhat more than the firm

plan did.



IV. Summary and Discussion.


        Early retirement window plans have become commonplace in the United

States in recent years. Based on the option value model of retirement

developed in earlier papers, this paper emphasizes the selection of the most

efficient plan. Three objectives are considered: minimizing expected labor

cost, maximizing induced retirement, and minimizing expected man-years of work

by older employees. The analysis is based on data from a large Fortune 500

firm. In emphasizing the potential to select plans to achieve a given goal,

the paper compares the effects of "optimal" plans with the effects of the firm

plan.

        The paper first highlights the power of window plans to induce early

retirement. The firm's plan --       providing   bonus payments of 3 to 12 months

salary   - - increased   retirement rates by up to two fold. Such a plan would

increase by 50 percent the proportion of workers employed at 52 that has

retired by age 60. These large increases in retirement rates are predicted

rather well by the option value model, suggesting that the model also could

serve as a basis for finding optimal window plans. This firm's window plan

was unanticipated and was not followed by other such plans. The effect of an

anticipated or recurring series of window plans may differ from the effect of
                                          (25)


the firm's plan. The optimal design of sequences of plans is left for future

analysis.

     As discussed in the introduction, there are several possible reasons for

window plans. One is that older workers are paid more than their marginal

products - -   and by   implication that the wages of older workers cannot be

reduced sufficiently to equate them to their marginal revenue products -        - and
thus the window, like defined benefit pension plans more generally, is used to

induce older workers to retire. This explanation is in line with the most

prevalent theoretical explanation for the structure of defined benefit pension

plans.23 A second reason is that the retirement of the older employees makes

room for the advancement of younger employees, thereby providing an incentive

to younger workers to remain with the firm. Part the opportunity cost of

retaining older employees is slower advancement for younger workers. A third

reason is simply that the window plan provides a convenient way to reduce the

size of the firm's workforce, without having to resort to layoffs. The latter

two explanations are often cited by firm executives as the motivation for

window plans.

     Although our results do not provide direct evidence on the actual

motivation for the firm's plan, three Sets of findings provide some insight

into the likelihood of alternative goals, and, by implication, the goals of

other firms that have adopted similar plans.

     First, given the cost of the firm's plan, we were unable to find a plan

that would induce more older employees to retire, if this were the goal of the

plan. Thus if the firm's goal were to induce as many retirements as possible,



     23See Lazear (1979]
                                      (26)


the window plan that it selected achieved about as much as was possible, given

the plan cost. In contrast, if the goal were to minimize the expected present

value of the wage bill of older workers (or to maximize the reduction in

future older-employee.years) optimal plans could be found that were much

better than the firm's plan. According to our results, the bonuses offered

under the firm's plan are too large to be consistent with minimizing the

expected future wage bill. The plan chosen to minimize expected labor cost

would induce almost 95 percent as many retirements as were induced by the

firm's plan, but at only 71 percent of the cost of the firm's plan. This is

possible because of the declining marginal effect of bonus payments on induced

retirement. For example, over 85 percent of the retirement effect of a 12-

month bonus to each employee 55 and older could be achieved with a 6-month

bonus to each employee. The current cost of the firm's plan (just over $4

million) is 63 percent of the expected future reduction in labor costs; the

ratio is 48 percent under the cost minimizing plan.

     Second, the results can be used to calculate implied bounds on the

expected future marginal products of the older workers who are induced to

retire. Suppose that the firm's goal were to maximize the reduction in the

future wage bill less the revenue product of the retiring workers. Including

the cost of the window plan itself, the net reduction in future labor costs

due to the firm's plan is 4.9 percent (from $47.64 to $45.29 million). But

the plan reduces expected discounted years of future employment of older

workers by 13.6 percent.24 Consider two extreme cases: first, assume that



     24To obtain this figure, future years of employment are discounted at the
same rate (5 percent) used to discount real salaries. This was computed using
(12) by setting Y to 1.0 for each worker and by dropping the term in
                                                                      C. The
resulting expected discounted future employee-years are: no window plan,
1520.5; firm plan, 1314.5; optimal cost-minizing plan, 1325.9.
                                             (27)


the marginal product of older workers who leave is the same as those who stay.

Under this assumption, the 13.6 percent reduction in employment of older

workers represents a 13.6 percent reduction in the expected present value of

the revenue product of older workers. In this case, then, the plan results in

a net loss of 8.7 percent. At the other extreme, assume that the marginal

revenue product of the workers who leave is zero -        - either   their physical

product could be zero, or there could be inadequate demand for the output of

the firm. In this case, the plan represents a net savings of 4.9 percent.

The "break-even" value of the marginal revenue product of the departing

workers - -   such   that the reduction in labor cost is equal to the reduction in

the value of production -- can be determined by equating the reduction in

expected future labor cost to the reduction in expected future revenues:

.049w —   •133er, where w is labor cost, e is employment and r is average
marginal revenue product per employee. Thus for the firm to break even

implies that w/er —      .133/.049 — 2.71.     That is, on average the retiring

employees would have to have been paid over 2.7 times their marginal revenue

for the firm's window plan to have a zero effect on net profit.

     Third, even the cost-minimizing optimal window is ill designed if the

goal is to increase firm profitability by retiring older employees whose

salaries exceed their marginal products. For the cost-minimizing plan to

achieve this goal, salaries of older workers would have to exceed their

marginal products by at least a factor of over 1.9, assuming that the plan

does not target specific employees with low productivity relative to their

wages. Under the cost-minimizing plan, labor cost is reduced by 6.7 percent

and years of older worker employment by 12.8 percent.

     Although we can only speculate about the firm's motivations, we consider

these three observations to weigh against the likelihood that the window plan
                                      (28)


was primarily aimed at retiring older workers because they are paid more than

their marginal products. Were this the firm's objective, the simulations

suggest it could have done better with a much less costly plan. And the

implied magnitude of the rents being earned by older workers (wages 2.7 times

marginal revenue product) strikes us as implausible. Moreover, were the plan

to target the least productive workers, the firm would save at most 4.9

percent of the expected wage bill of older workers, assuming the marginal

product of the employees who are induced to retire would otherwise be zero.

It is clear, however, that the plan does not explicitly target individual

employees: the bonus schedule depends only on age and years of service.

Without targeting individuals, there seems no reason to believe that the

employees with the highest salary to productivity ratios would be the most

likely to leave. Rather, these employees are likely to have a more

advantageous position with this firm than they could obtain with another firm,

and thus would be the least likely to leave. To the extent that employees

leave this firm to take another job, those with the highest productivity

relative to their wage arguably are the most likely to find a better job

elsewhere and thus would be the most likely to leave this firm. Nonetheless,

as a logical possibility, the retiring workers might be paid much more than

their marginal revenue product and this might have been the motivation for the

window, but if so the plan was ill-designed and the older employees were

unproductive indeed.

     Thus, based on these data it is unlikely in our judgment that the goal of

the window plan was to induce older workers to retire because their

productivity was low relative to their salaries. The evidence is more

consistent with a desire to reduce the overall size of the labor force, or to
                                       (29)


reduce the number of older employees to allow promotion of younger employees.

The window plan is a convenient and powerful means of reducing employment

without having to resort to layoffs.
