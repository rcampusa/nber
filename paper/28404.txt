                                          ABSTRACT

We dissect the impact of a large and sudden exchange rate appreciation on Swiss border import
prices, retail prices, and consumer expenditures on domestic and imported non-durable goods,
following the removal of the EUR/CHF floor in January 2015. Cross-sectional variation in border
price changes by currency of invoicing carries over to consumer prices and allocations, impacting
retail prices of imports and competing domestic goods, as well as import expenditures. We
provide measures of the sensitivity of retail import prices to border prices and the sensitivity of
import shares to relative prices, which is higher when using retail prices than border prices.

1       Introduction

In this paper we study how prices and consumer expenditures respond to exchange rate
movements based on the large and sudden appreciation of the Swiss franc (CHF) on January
15, 2015. Using data on prices and invoicing currency at the border, as well as Nielsen
"homescan" data on retail prices and purchases by Swiss households, we present a range of
facts that shed light on the sources of incomplete exchange rate pass-through and the role
of nominal rigidities in price adjustment, the extent of expenditure switching by households,
and the allocative implications of invoicing currency in international trade. We also provide
estimates of the sensitivities of retail prices to border prices and import shares to relative
prices, which are important elasticities in open economy models.

The Swiss experience provides a unique setting to study the consequences of a large
policy-driven change in the nominal exchange rate. On September 6, 2011, after a sharp
appreciation of the Swiss franc, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) introduced a minimum
exchange rate of 1.20 CHF per EUR. In late 2014 and early 2015, foreign developments
such as anticipation of a large-scale quantitative easing program in the euro area raised the
perceived cost of sustaining this policy (see e.g. SNB, 2015; Amador et al., 2020), prompting
the SNB to unexpectedly abandon the minimum exchange rate on January 15, 2015.1

The subsequent appreciation episode is unique in a number of ways.2 First, it followed a
period of remarkable exchange rate stability, with the EUR/CHF exchange rate fluctuating
in the range of 1.2­1.22 in the last six months before January 15, 2015. It is hence unlikely that
the price dynamics we examine reflect adjustment lags due to prior exchange rate movements.
Second, the exchange rate movement was large in magnitude relative to standard short-term
exchange rate fluctuations in advanced economies, which have been a main focus of the
literature.3 EUR/CHF appreciated by more than 20% on the day of the policy change, 14.0%
by the end of March relative to January 14, 14.7% by the end of June, and 10.6% by the
    1
      The SNB had reiterated its commitment to the minimum exchange rate throughout late 2014, arguing
as late as December 1 that it "remains the key instrument for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions"
(see Jordan, 2014). Of 22 economists surveyed between January 9 and 14, 2015, none expected the SNB to
get rid of its minimum rate during the course of 2015 (see Bloomberg, 2015). Forward rates the day before
the appreciation show that investors expected a flat profile of the exchange rate, as illustrated in Panel (a) in
Figure 1. Jermann (2017) argues that option prices before January 15 revealed a low probability of abandoning
the exchange rate floor.
    2
      A number of related papers also examine this episode. Bonadio et al. (2019) document the response of unit
values at the border, Efing et al. (2016) examine the effects on the valuations of publicly listed Swiss firms,
and Kaufmann and Renkin (2017, 2019) study the price and employment response of Swiss manufacturing
firms and the response of export prices.
    3
      There are many papers that resort to large devaluations in developing countries; see, for example, Burstein
et al. (2005), Alessandria et al. (2010), Cravino and Levchenko (2017), and Gopinath and Neiman (2014).
However, these episodes tend to be accompanied by other major macroeconomic developments that can
confound the effects of exchange rate movements. Cavallo et al. (2015) use micro data on prices to show
how a large monetary shock in a non-crisis context ­ Latvia's euro area accession ­ impacts international
relative prices.

end of December 2015 (see panel (a) in Figure 1).4 The CPI-based bilateral real exchange
rate followed a similar path to the EUR/CHF nominal exchange rate, as shown in Figure A.1
in the online appendix (referred to as appendix from here on). The real appreciation was
prolonged, with the EUR/CHF real exchange rate returning to its December 2014 level only
by the end of 2017. Third, the appreciation occurred against the backdrop of a stable Swiss
economy -- Table A.1 in the appendix shows that Swiss economic aggregates were remarkably
stable in 2012-2016 -- and reflected a policy response to foreign events.5

Following the 2015 CHF appreciation, there was a large decline in average import prices --
more so at the border than at the consumer level -- and a muted response in average prices
of Swiss-produced goods (which we refer to interchangeably as domestic goods), as shown in
panel (b) in Figure 1 using aggregate price indices from the SNB and the Swiss Federation
Statistical Office (SFSO). To examine in more detail the response of these prices, as well as
consumer expenditures, we combine several micro-level data sources, described in Section 2.
Information on border prices and invoicing currency is from the good-level survey underlying
the calculation of the official Swiss import price index. The transaction-level information on
non-durable retail prices and expenditures is from the Swiss Nielsen homescan data, which we
        4
      The Swiss franc appreciated less markedly against other currencies such as the yen or the pound sterling,
as is evidenced by the effective exchange rate index shown in panel (a) in Figure 1.
    5
      The price movements we focus on are unlikely to be the lagged result of safe-haven capital inflows while
the minimum rate was in place. Foreign safe-haven demand for CHF was largely channelled through branches
of foreign banks and invested in sight deposit accounts at the SNB (see e.g. Auer, 2015). Moreover, the CHF
real exchange rate did not appreciate much in that period, and when it did in 2015, the growth rate of real
GDP and real consumption fell slightly relative to 2014 (see Table A.1 in the appendix).


                                                                            2
augment with data on the origin of the purchased goods. We exploit variation across product
categories in currency of invoicing to trace the role of invoicing from border prices to retail
prices and, further, to expenditure allocations.

We start our analysis in Section 3 by documenting the response of border prices in the
aftermath of the appreciation and how this response varies across goods by invoicing currency.
The decline in border prices was much larger for EUR-invoiced goods than for CHF-invoiced
goods, even conditioning on non-zero price changes, consistent with findings in Gopinath et al.
(2010) for border prices in the United States. However, estimated differences in conditional
price changes attenuate over time and become statistically insignificant about one year after
the CHF appreciation. These patterns are qualitatively consistent with models of endogenous
invoicing (e.g. Gopinath et al., 2010). We perform simple accounting exercises to quantify
the impact on border prices of hypothetical changes in the currency of invoicing from CHF to
EUR and changes in the degree of nominal price stickiness. We conclude from these exercises
that over short horizons (during which border price stickiness in the currency of invoicing is
quantitatively relevant), counterfactual shifts in the currency of invoicing have larger effects
on border prices than do counterfactual shifts in the degree of nominal price stickiness.

In Section 4 we examine the response of retail prices. After documenting in the homescan data
a decline in the retail price of imports relative to Swiss-produced goods, we provide evidence
that variation across goods in invoicing currency at the border has a sizable impact on retail
price changes faced by consumers. According to our estimates, in the first two quarters
after the appreciation, retail import prices in product categories that are (hypothetically)
fully invoiced in foreign currency fell by roughly 7 percentage points more than in product
categories (hypothetically) fully invoiced in CHF. While previous evidence on the role of
invoicing currency is based on import and export price changes at the border (see e.g.
Gopinath et al., 2010; Fitzgerald and Haller, 2014; Gopinath, 2016), our results establish
that differences in border price changes associated with the currency of invoicing carry over
to consumer prices.6

We estimate the sensitivity of import prices at the retail level with respect to changes
in border prices, leveraging heterogeneity in border price changes induced by variation in
pre-appreciation EUR invoicing shares. These estimates imply that, after two quarters, a 1
percentage point larger reduction in import prices at the border resulted in a roughly 0.55
percentage point larger price reduction for imported products at the retail level.7

    6
      The invoicing currency and response of border and consumer prices to exchange rate movements is an
important ingredient of optimal exchange rate policy (see e.g. Engel, 2003; Devereux and Engel, 2007; Egorov
and Mukhin, 2020).
    7
      Berger et al. (2012) use the micro price data underlying the official US import and consumer price indices of
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to match individual identical items at the border and retail levels, estimating
the evolution of good-specific distribution shares. For related work studying pass-through at different layers
of the distribution chain, see e.g. Nakamura and Zerom (2010) and Goldberg and Hellerstein (2013).


                                                        3
Even though the response of retail prices of Swiss-produced goods was on average very muted,
we show that prices fell more in border product categories invoiced in EUR relative to those in
CHF, conditioning on the expenditure share of competing imported goods in the same product
category. Relatedly, prices of domestically produced goods fell by more in product categories
with larger declines in retail prices of imported goods conditioning on import shares. We
argue that, under a certain exclusion restriction, these observations point to the presence of
pricing complementarities that imply that domestic producers react to changes in prices of
competing imported retail products.8

We further examine the response of the extensive margin of adjustment of retail prices. We
show that the average decline in retail import prices in 2015 was partly accounted for by an
increase in the fraction of nominal price changes, which can in turn be decomposed into a
large increase in the frequency of price reductions and a smaller decline in the fraction of
price increases. We provide aggregate time series evidence as well as cross-product evidence
exploiting variations in invoicing currency and in the magnitude of changes of border prices.
Specifically, the increase in the frequency of price reductions was larger for imported products
with a larger share of EUR invoicing and with larger price reductions at the border. That
is, differences in border price changes associated with the currency of invoicing carry over
to consumer prices not only for average changes but also for the extensive margin of price
adjustment.9

Finally, in Section 5 we examine the extent of consumer expenditure switching in response
to the appreciation. On average during the year following the appreciation, expenditure
shares of imported goods rose by roughly 4% (or by 1 percentage point, from 0.26 to 0.27).
Import shares rose substantially even at short horizons after the appreciation. Leveraging
cross-sectional variation along the invoicing dimension, we show that expenditure shares on
imported goods increased by more in product categories in which imports are invoiced in
EUR than in those categories invoiced in CHF. Hence, differences in invoicing currency at
the border matter also for consumer allocations.10 To estimate the sensitivity of import
expenditure shares with respect to changes in relative prices, we instrument import price

    8
       These results complement evidence of strategic complementarities in Gopinath and Itskhoki (2011), Auer
and Schoenle (2016), and Amiti et al. (2019), using retail price data and in the context of a well-identified
exchange rate shock. Relatedly, Cavallo et al. (2020) and Flaaen et al. (2020) show that US domestic producers
increased retail prices in response to the recent increase in US tariffs on competing Chinese imports.
     9
       For related work documenting the role of the extensive margin of price adjustment in response to large
aggregate shocks, see e.g. Gagnon (2009) in the context of Mexico's 1994 devaluation, Karadi and Reiff (2019)
in the context of VAT changes in Hungary, and Gopinath et al. (2012) in the context of the trade collapse
during the 2008 Great Recession.
    10
       Differences in currency of invoicing at the border also carry over to allocations in the export side. In the
context of the CHF appreciation, Auer et al. (2019) show that export growth in 2015 was larger in industries
with higher EUR invoicing of export border prices. Cravino (2017) uses data on Chilean exports to estimate the
differential response of exports to exchange rate shocks according to the invoicing currency of the transaction.
Amiti et al. (2018) study the differential response of Belgian exports across heterogeneous firms within sectors.

changes across product categories using EUR invoicing shares at the border. Estimated price
elasticities of import shares are close to 1 based on border-level measures of import prices,
and much higher (ranging between 2 and 5) based on retail-level measures of import prices,
but also less tightly estimated given large idiosyncratic movements in consumer prices. The
large gap in estimated elasticities based on the measure of import prices is partly explained
by lower exchange rate pass-through into retail prices compared with border prices.11



2        Data description

In this section we provide an overview of the border and retail data that we use in our analysis.
We provide additional details in Appendix B. In the replication package we provide contact
information to obtain the proprietary data.


2.1      Import prices at the border

We base the analysis of border prices on the microdata used by the SFSO to calculate the
Swiss Import Price Index (Swiss Federal Statistical Office, 2016). The data are a survey-based
panel of Swiss import prices similar to the US import price data studied in Gopinath and
Rigobon (2008). The survey asks firms12 to quote the price and invoicing currency of the
goods accounting for the firm's highest volume of imports.13 Since most consumer goods
are surveyed on a quarterly basis, we focus on this time horizon. Surveys are carried out
by the SFSO in the first two weeks of each quarter. In the exposition, we refer to the
last pre-appreciation quarterly observations (first two weeks of January 2015) as 14Q4, and
to the first post-appreciation quarterly observations (first two weeks of April 2015) as 15Q1.
Since we observe weights by product categories only starting in December 2015 (after a major
resampling of products), our baseline border price regressions are unweighted. For regressions
that use the subset of categories matched to the retail data, we weight according to consumer
expenditures.


    11
      Our estimates based on retail prices are on the high range of elasticity estimates in the literature based
on time-series variation and using border prices to measure import prices (see e.g. Feenstra et al., 2018, and
references therein).
   12
      The SFSO data contain an importing firm identifier, which we use in sensitivity analysis of border price
pass-through. However, since we do not observe firm characteristics of Swiss importers or foreign exporters,
we do not study the fundamentals that drive heterogeneous invoicing patterns as in e.g. Devereux et al. (2017)
and Amiti et al. (2018).
   13
      For each good invoiced in foreign currency, we have information on the price expressed in foreign currency
and the price expressed in CHF. Given that for some observations there are large disparities between exchange
rates implied by these two prices and official exchange rates (that are likely due to errors by contractors
performing the conversion), we perform robustness exercises in which we convert foreign currency prices into
CHF using official exchange rates.

Notes: This table shows the number of observations and the share of observations invoiced in CHF, EUR, and
USD for various years in the non-commodity border price sample.


Table 1 displays, for the sample of non-commodity goods (commodities include agricultural
products, coal, petroleum, metals, electricity and gas), the number of border price
observations and the share of observations by currency of invoicing per year between 2013
and 2016. The share of observations invoiced in either CHF or EUR is close to 95% over
the whole period, with CHF accounting for the highest share but falling over time.14 USD
invoicing is quite limited (the US accounted for 7% of Swiss goods imports in 2015).15 In our
baseline regressions, we exclude goods invoiced in foreign currency other than EUR because
other currencies fluctuated vis-´
                                a-vis CHF and EUR before January 15, 2015.

The SFSO assigns imported goods to industries based on the industry of the importing firm
using a classification similar to the 4-digit North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) code in the US. Our sample of non-commodity products covers 188 such product
categories, of which 43 are consumer good categories that can be matched to retail categories
as described below. For our analysis tracing currency of invoicing at the border to retail prices
and expenditures, we calculate a pre-appreciation measure of invoicing intensity by border
product category. We define the EUR invoicing share by product category as the fraction
of border prices invoiced in EUR (relative to those invoiced in CHF or EUR) across all four
quarters in 2014. In Table B.5 in the appendix we report the list of matched border product
categories and retail product categories, as well as the EUR invoicing share of each category.

Given our prior that EUR invoicing shares by category are less tightly inferred for categories
with a low number of border price observations, we exclude from our baseline analysis 6 (out
of 43) border product categories for which we observe 7 or fewer border prices per quarter



  14
      The rise over time in the share of EUR-invoiced goods is largely due to entry of new goods into the
sample that are invoiced in EUR. For continuing products, the fraction that switches invoicing currency
between quarters is very low, on average roughly 0.5% per quarter in 2015 (see Figure B.1 in the appendix).
   15
      As reported in Table B.1 in the appendix, invoicing shares are very similar if we weight border product
categories using NAICS two-digit weights in December 2015, which is the first period the SFSO reports weights.
We note that Bonadio et al. (2019) and Federal Customs Administration (2015) report invoicing shares for
imports based on more comprehensive customs data, allowing transactions to be weighted by import volume.
In Federal Customs Administration (2015), import invoicing shares in 2014 are 31.6% for CHF, 54.9% for

share in 2014 varies between 0 and 0.74, with a median of 0.13 and a mean of 0.25.


2.2     Retail prices and expenditures

The analysis of retail prices and expenditures is based on Nielsen homescan data covering
a demographically and regionally representative sample of around 3,000 households in
Switzerland in the period January 2012 to June 2016 (Nielsen Switzerland, 2016).
Participating households record purchases in supermarkets and drugstores, scanning goods
such as food, non-food grocery items, health and beauty aids, and selected general
merchandise. Individual products are classified into one of 256 product classes (which are
narrower than border product categories) such as apple juice, shampoo, and toilet paper.17

In the raw data, an observation is a transaction including the household identifier, barcode
(European Article Number, or EAN) of the product purchased, quantity purchased, price
paid (net of good-specific discounts due to e.g. coupons), date of the shopping trip, and the
name of the retailer. In the three months after the CHF appreciation, we observe on average
85 transactions per household. The data include 17 distinct retail stores. Since we do not
observe the location of the retailer in a transaction, we assign it to one of 23 regions where
the household lives (for more details, see appendix). We exclude purchases made in other
countries via cross-border shopping.

We augment these data with information on the country of production of individual goods.
Whereas EAN codes provide information on the country in which a product has been
registered, in many instances this is not the country in which the product has actually been
produced. However, that information is disclosed in the label of each product. We collect
label information from codecheck.info, a Swiss health information portal with a large database
of products sold in supermarkets, drug stores, and pharmacies (Codecheck, 2016). Coverage
is not complete and notably excludes goods that are only occasionally sold in grocery stores,
such as toys, clothing, or household electronics. We drop observations for which we do not




   16
      The 6 categories we drop account for roughly 12% of retail expenditures on imported goods in 2014. In the
sensitivity analysis, we consider a more restrictive sample that drops 9 categories with 8 or fewer observations
per quarter, and a less restrictive sample that drops 2 categories with 4 or fewer observations per quarter. We
also discuss which results are robust to keeping all border categories, including those with only 2 observations
per quarter.
   17
      In the Appendix we describe additional adjustments we make to the data, such as dropping newspapers,
magazines, and non pre-packaged fresh fruits and vegetables products, and dropping transactions with errors
in the entered price.

2014 (which we use in the baseline regressions). The `balanced yearly' sample is a subsample of the first one
that only includes goods observed each year between 2013 and 2015. The `balanced monthly' sample is a
subsample of the first one that only includes goods observed every month from mid-2013 to mid-2016. No.

Table 2 provides basic summary statistics of the Nielsen data, for three different samples. The
first sample (non-balanced) consists of goods with information on country of origin (imports
or domestic) that can be matched to border product categories with more than seven border
price observations per quarter in 2014. The second sample (balanced yearly) is a subsample
of the first one that only includes goods observed each year between 2013 and 2015. The
third sample (balanced monthly) is a subsample of the first one that only includes goods
observed in each of the 18 months before and after the appreciation. We use the first and
second samples in our analysis of expenditure allocations. We use the third sample in our
analysis of retail prices. For each sample we provide the number of unique imported and
domestic products, product classes, transactions, and import shares in 2014. The share of
expenditures on imports relative to expenditures on all goods for which we observe country of

     We accessed codecheck.info between October 2015 and March 2016, searching for all goods in the Nielsen
data. We also cross-checked the results from codecheck.info with information on websites of the various
retailers. To get a sense of coverage, there are 5,444 unique goods in the Nielsen dataset that are observed in
each of the 18 months before and after the appreciation. We found 3,481 of these goods on the web, accounting
for 72% of all expenditures in this balanced sample of goods in 2014.


                                                      8
origin is 27% in the non-balanced sample (and 23% in the monthly balanced sample).19 The
import share is 23% in the non-balanced sample if we restrict the sample to goods imported
from the European Union (EU). In our baseline results we include all imports because we do
not observe the country of origin of imports in the border price data.



3        Exchange rate pass-through to border prices

In this section we report the impact of the 2015 CHF appreciation on border prices, first
at the level of individual goods and then at the level of product categories.                       We then
document the extent of price flexibility and exchange rate pass-through by currency of
invoicing, conditioning and not conditioning on nominal price changes. Finally, we perform
simple accounting exercises to quantify the impact on border prices of counterfactual shifts
in invoicing from CHF to EUR and changes in the degree of nominal price stickiness.


3.1      Changes in average border prices by currency of invoicing

We first document the differential response of average changes in border prices by currency
of invoicing after the CHF appreciation. We denote by pbor
                                                       it the log of the border price (in
CHF) of imported good i in quarter t. Keeping in mind our date convention, we refer to the
period prior to the CHF appreciation as 14Q4. We consider panel regressions of the form


                         pbor
                          it =            s × Is=t × EU Rinvi + t + i + it ,                               (1)
                                 s=14Q4


over the period t = 13Q1, ..., 16Q2, where Is=t is the time period indicator function,
EU Rinvi = 1 (= 0) if product i is invoiced in EUR (CHF) in quarter 14Q4, t is a time
fixed effect, and i is a product fixed effect.20 Observations are equally weighted since we do
not observe import values per product. Standard errors are clustered at the level of border
product categories.

Panel (a) of Figure 2 displays estimates of t and t + t between 2013 and 2016, representing
average cumulative changes, relative to 14Q14, in CHF-invoiced and EUR-invoiced border
prices, respectively. CHF- and EUR-invoiced goods display similar price dynamics before

    19
       For comparison purposes, the share of imports in total consumption reported in SFSO (2014) is 26.7% in
2014. Since services are mostly locally sourced, this means that the import share in our sample is lower than
in overall consumption of goods.
    20
       We consider a balanced panel of products with price data every quarter in the two-year period 13Q4-15Q3.
We do not include 15Q4 in the balanced panel because the SFSO conducted a major re-sampling of products in
December 2015. Moreover, for every quarter we exclude a small number of observations for which the currency
of invoicing differs from 14Q4.

January 2015, a period of stability of the EUR/CHF exchange rate. In contrast, EUR-invoiced
prices fall significantly relative to CHF-invoiced prices in the post-appreciation period. As
summarized in the top rows of Table 3, the EUR appreciated by 14.0% in the first three months
and by 14.7% in the first six months after December 2014. EUR-invoiced border prices fell
by 12.4% and 13.8% in the first and second quarters, respectively (implying exchange rate
pass-through rates of 89% and 94%, respectively). CHF-invoiced border prices fell by 3.4%
and 4.5%, respectively, during the same time (implying pass-through rates of 24% and 31%,
respectively).

 Notes: This figure presents the EUR/CHF exchange rate and border price changes compared with 14Q4 based
 on estimates of equation (1). Panels (a) and (b) display average price changes by currency of invoicing, either
 all price changes (a) or non-zero price changes (b). Panels (c) and (d) show the difference in the average
 price change of EUR-invoiced goods and CHF-invoiced goods including time × category fixed effects, either all
 price changes or non-zero price changes. Whiskers indicate the bounds of a 95% confidence interval, calculated
 clustering at the level of border product category.


Average differences in price changes by currency of invoicing (i.e. t ) fall over time from
roughly 9% in 15Q1 to 5.5% in 15Q4, explained in part by a gradual decline in CHF-invoiced
prices and in part by overshooting of the EUR/CHF and EUR-invoiced prices. Estimates of

t are similar if we include time fixed effects or time × category fixed effects, as shown in
panel (c) of Figure 2. Table C.2 in Appendix C.1 reports estimates and standard errors of t
for each quarter after 14Q4, as well as the average effect in the first three quarters of 2015
calculated by imposing a single  over this time period. In Appendix C.1 we report a wide
range of sensitivity analysis.


3.2    Invoicing and price changes across product categories

We next show that the differential response of border prices by invoicing currency that we
document above helps explain part of the variation in average border price changes across
product categories. We exploit this relationship when we match individual retail goods to
product categories at the border.

We estimate
                            pbor   bor
                             gt - pg 14Q4 = t + t × EU Rshareg + gt ,                                    (2)

where pbor
       gt denotes the simple average of border prices in border category g at time t (including
prices in all invoicing currencies), EU RShareg denotes the fraction of border prices in
category g invoiced in EUR across all quarters of 2014, and t is a time fixed effect.

Table 4 reports estimates of t between 15Q1 and 16Q2 for different sets of product categories
and weighting schemes. We consider the baseline dataset of non-commodity categories and
the restricted set of consumer good categories that we match to our Nielsen data and that
hence can be used in our retail price and expenditure analysis below. For the sample of
Nielsen categories, we consider unweighted and weighted estimates (using 2014 consumer
expenditures by category). In Appendix C.2 we report additional sensitivity analysis.

Notes: This table displays estimates of t in equation (2) between 15Q1 and 16Q2 for different sets of product
categories and weighting schemes. The first column uses all non-commodity product categories, while the
second and third columns use the baseline sample of border categories in our retail price analysis. The first
and second columns show results from unweighted regressions, whereas the third column weights according to
Nielsen consumer expenditures in 2014. The upper panel shows estimates of t between 15Q1 and 16Q2. The
bottom panel shows the average effect (imposing a common t ) in 15Q1, 15Q2, and 15Q3. Estimates of (2)
by quarter in 15Q1, 15Q2, and 15Q3 imply R2 of 0.35, 0.4, and 0.29, respectively. Standard errors clustered
by border category are shown in brackets.


Estimates of t are negative and highly significant in the first three quarters of 2015 (except
in Q1 of the unweighted Nielsen border sample), indicating that border prices fall more,
on average, in product categories with more EUR invoicing. Estimates of t in the first
three quarters are largest in the weighted Nielsen sample, in spite of the low number of
categories. The weighted Nielsen-based estimates imply that a category that is fully invoiced
in EUR experiences in the first three quarters of 2015 a decline in border prices that is
between 11% and 13.5% larger relative to a category that is fully invoiced in CHF. These
differences are slightly larger than those based on individual product prices (that combine
within and between category variation) reported in Table C.4 of the appendix. Variation
across product categories in 2014 invoicing shares explains (in terms of R2 ) between 29% and


                                                     12
40% of cumulative changes in border prices across Nielsen categories in each of the first three
quarters of 2015. This relationship is much weaker starting in 15Q4, when the border price
sample size declines due to product re-sampling by the SFSO.

Regression (2) constitutes the basis of the first stage in the 2SLS regressions we consider
below. The results above anticipate that the first stage is strong in the first three quarters of
2015.


3.3     Price stickiness and border price changes

We begin by measuring the quarterly frequency of price changes and showing that for
CHF-invoiced goods it increases substantially after the CHF appreciation. We then show
that differences in border price changes by currency of invoicing persist when we condition
on nominal price changes in the invoicing currency.

The top panel of Figure 3 displays, by invoicing currency, the fraction of products for which
the price (in its currency of invoicing) in any quarter differs from the price in Q4 of the
previous year.21 For CHF-invoiced products, the fraction of products with a price change
in 2014 (relative to Q4 of 2013) is roughly 41% in Q1 and 52% in Q2. These measures are
similar in 2013. EUR-invoiced prices change less frequently.22

In 2015, after the CHF appreciation, there is a marked increase in the fraction of price changes
for CHF-invoiced goods, even though prices are still far from fully flexible. The fraction of
price changes (relative to Q4 of the previous year) rises from 41% in 14Q1 to 58% in 15Q1,
from 52% in 14Q2 to 66% 15Q2, from 57% in 14Q3 to 71% in 15Q3, and from 61% in 14Q4
to 75% in 15Q4.23 The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows that the increase in the fraction of
price changes for CHF-invoiced goods is achieved through a large and long-lasting (i.e. not
driven by temporary sales) increase in the fraction of price reductions and a small decline
in the fraction of price increases (the latter is shown in Figure C.1 in the appendix). For
EUR-invoiced products, the fraction of products with a price change or a price decrease does
not change much in 2015.

We next return to regression (1), conditioning on non-zero price changes as in Gopinath
   21
       We exclude observations with price imputations due to product replacements, as well as observations in
which the currency of invoicing differs from Q4 in the previous year.
    22
       The average fraction of price changes from one quarter to another when pooling all quarters between 2013
and 2015 is roughly 35% for CHF-invoiced goods and 25% for non-CHF invoiced goods. To put these numbers
in perspective, the average monthly frequency of border price changes for differentiated imported and exported
goods in the US reported in Table IV of Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) is roughly 0.15, implying a quarterly
frequency of 1 - 0.853 = 0.39 (assuming that the probability of a price change is independent across months).
    23
       In Table C.10 in the appendix we additionally show that the degree of price flexibility is a characteristic
that varies persistently across goods. For any given horizon, products for which price changed in 2013 (2014)
are more likely to display a price change in 2014 (2015). The likelihood of a price change rises in 2015
irrespective of whether the price changed in previous years.

et al. (2010). Panel (b) of Figure 2 displays average cumulative price changes by currency
of invoicing. CHF-invoiced prices in 2015 fall relative to 14Q4, by 5.8% in Q1, 6.9% in Q2,
and 7.2% in Q3 and Q4 (exchange rate pass-through rates of 42% and 47% in Q1 and Q2,
respectively, and roughly 70% in Q3 and Q4). Note the gradual decline in CHF-invoiced reset
prices in spite of EUR/CHF overshooting. In contrast, EUR-invoiced prices (expressed in
CHF) fall by slightly more than the EUR/CHF exchange rate (note, however, that standard
errors are much larger due to smaller sample size).

Estimated differences in non-zero price changes by currency of invoicing (i.e. t ) fall over
time from 10% in Q1 to 5% in Q4. Allowing for time × category fixed effects, estimates of
t (displayed in panel (c) of Figure 2 and in Table C.2) are as large initially but attenuate
more rapidly over time and become insignificant in 2016. In sensitivity analysis in Appendix
C, we show that, for certain sample choices, estimates of t become insignificant as early as

                                                            14
Q3 of 2015.

In Appendix C.1, we show that independently of invoicing, prices of commodities (excluded
from our baseline analysis) change much more frequently than those of non-commodities.
Moreover, differences in price changes by invoicing currency (including time × category fixed
effects) are small and mostly insignificant. These results are consistent with the view that
currency of invoicing is quantitatively relevant for price changes only for products with sticky
prices in their currency of invoicing.

The fact that pass-through rates conditional on price changes are significantly smaller for
CHF-invoiced products than for EUR-invoiced products, but only in the earlier quarters
after the CHF appreciation, is qualitatively consistent with models of endogenous invoicing
as in Gopinath et al. (2010). Specifically, in those models the choice of invoicing currency
is determined by a discounted sum of future desired pass-through conditional on non-price
adjustment. Hence, currency choice puts a higher weight on conditional pass-through rates
in earlier periods after the exchange rate shock, which is precisely when estimated differences
in conditional pass-through rates between invoicing currencies are larger in our data.24


3.4    Accounting-based counterfactuals

What would have been the average change in border prices had these been fully invoiced
in CHF or in EUR? How do counterfactual changes in invoicing currency compare with
counterfactual changes in the degree of price stickiness? We answer these questions by
performing simple accounting exercises.

The average change in CHF-invoiced border prices in quarter t relative to 14Q4 is pbor
                                                                                   Ct =
fCt × sCt , where fCt denotes the fraction of CHF-invoiced prices that change between 14Q4
and t, and sCt denotes the average size of these non-zero price changes (reset prices). The
average change in EUR-invoiced border prices (expressed in CHF) is pbor
                                                                    Et = fEt × sEt +
(1 - fEt ) × et , where fEt denotes the fraction of EUR-invoiced prices that change (in EUR)
between 14Q4 and t, sEt denotes the average size of these non-zero price changes (expressed
in CHF), and et denotes the EUR/CHF change in this time period. The average change
in border prices including both invoicing currencies (roughly 2/3 CHF and 1/3 EUR) is
pbor
 t   = 2/3 × pbor         bor                            bor   bor       bor for the first and
              Ct + 1/3 × pEt . Row 1 of Table 5 reports pCt , pEt , and pt




  24
     We leave for future research whether an endogenous currency choice model is quantitatively consistent
with the profile of pass-through rates and the increase in the fraction of non-zero price changes we document
for this large and unanticipated exchange rate shock.


                                                     15
last quarters of 2015 (quarters 2 and 3 are reported in Table C.12 in Appendix C.4).25

Rows 2 and 3 consider counterfactual degrees of price stickiness given actual average reset
price changes by currency of invoicing. Specifically, row 2 ("All sticky") sets fCt = fEt = 0, so
that pbor         bor
      Ct = 0 and pEt = et . Row 3 ("All flex") sets fCt = fEt = 1 and actual sCt and sEt , so
that pbor           bor
      Ct = sCt and pEt = sEt . In the "All flex" scenario we are assuming that, for products
with unchanged price in 2015 (due to e.g. menu costs, information costs, or inattention) the
price would change, if given the opportunity to do so, as much as observed reset prices in the
data.26 We do not take into account equilibrium changes in reset prices in each counterfactual
scenario, as could be the case in the presence of pricing complementarities across price setters.

In 15Q1, the average decline in border prices is -4.7% under "All sticky" and -9.1% under "All
flex". This implies that a counterfactual shift from "All sticky" to "All flex" would result in
a 4.5 percentage point (pp) larger reduction in border prices in 15Q1 (row 4). To understand
these results, note that if sCt = 0 and sEt = et , a shift from "All sticky" to "All flex" would
have no impact on average border price changes. In practice, reset prices fall by much less
(but not zero) for CHF-invoiced than for EUR-invoiced goods, so changes in the degree of
price flexibility have a limited impact on border price changes. The difference between CHF
and EUR price changes, which is 14% under "All sticky", is as large as 9.9% under "All flex".

Rows 5 and 6 consider counterfactual invoicing choices. We assume that the degree of price
stickiness is a characteristic of the invoicing currency, while the size of non-zero price changes
(expressed in CHF) is a characteristic of the product and not of the invoicing currency,
as in models in which invoicing currency choice on a product is shaped by its conditional
pass-through rate. Specifically, in row 5 ("All CHF") we assume that EUR-invoiced goods
are counterfactually invoiced in CHF, so that for these goods pbor
                                                               Et = fCt × sEt . In row 6
("All EUR") we assume that all CHF-invoiced goods are counterfactually invoiced in EUR,
so that pbor
         Ct = fEt × sCt + (1 - fEt ) × et . Note that if prices were fully flexible, then these
counterfactual shifts in currency of invoicing would have no impact on average border price
changes.



   25
      The average change in EUR-invoiced prices, pbor  Et , reported in Table 5 differs from that in Table 3 (by
roughly 2.1 percentage points in 15Q1). This is due to sample differences (in our sticky price calculations we
drop observations with price imputations arising from product replacement) and because we impose that for
EUR-invoiced goods with zero price changes the change in price (expressed in CHF) is equal to the change in
the EUR/CHF, et , which is not always the case in the raw data due to errors in exchange rate conversion. In
Appendix C.4 we show that results do not vary much when using prices that are converted into CHF based on
the official quarterly EUR/CHF rate. We also report sensitivity to using a smaller CHF invoicing share when
calculating pbor
              t .
   26
      In the appendix we provide suggestive evidence that the size of price changes in 2015 is independent of the
degree of price flexibility in previous years. Specifically, in Table C.11 we show that the size of price changes
in 2015 does not vary systematically across products with the likelihood of a price change in previous years (a
measure of the product's price flexibility).

Notes: See main text for a description of each counterfactual. Quarters 2 and 3 are reported in the Appendix.


Evaluated at the degree of price flexibility in the data, the average decline in border prices
in 15Q1 is -5.3% under "All CHF" and -12.5% under "All EUR". This implies that a
counterfactual shift from "All CHF" to "All EUR" would result in a 7.2 pp larger reduction
in border prices in 15Q1 (Row 7).27

Comparing rows 4 and 7, we observe that a shift in invoicing from "All CHF" to "All EUR"
(given the observed degree of price stickiness) has a bigger impact on average border price
changes than a shift from "All sticky" to "All flex" (given the observed fraction of goods
by invoicing currency). This is also the case in 15Q2, as shown in Table C.12 in Appendix
C.4. In contrast, in 15Q4 (as well as in 15Q3) a shift in invoicing has a smaller impact on
average border prices than a shift in price flexibility. Currency of invoicing of border prices
matters less over time because at longer time horizons border prices are more flexible and the
EUR/CHF appreciation is smaller.



4        Retail price response

In this section we examine the response of Nielsen-based retail prices to the CHF appreciation.
After reporting average changes in retail prices of imports and Swiss-produced goods, we
examine how these changes vary in the cross-section by invoicing currency at the border
and import penetration. We then estimate the sensitivity of retail import prices to border
prices, and the sensitivity of Swiss-produced retail prices to import retail prices. Finally, we
document changes in the extensive margin of price adjustment, first on average for imports
    27
     If we assume that both the fraction and size of non-zero price changes is a characteristic of the currency
choice and not of the product (in contrast to models of endogenous invoicing currency), then, pbor   Et = pCt
                                                                                                             bor
                       bor    bor
under "All CHF" and pCt = pEt under "All EUR". The impact of a shift from "All CHF" to "All EUR" is
11.1 pp in 15Q1, which is even larger than 7.2 pp under our baseline assumptions.

4.1           Average price changes for imports and Swiss-produced goods

Consistent with the official consumer price inflation estimates displayed in Figure 1, retail
import prices in the Nielsen data fell in 2015 relative to Swiss-produced goods.

response of Swiss-produced goods is more muted. As summarized in the bottom two rows
of Table 3, the cumulative decline in retail import prices is 1.3% in 15Q1 and 3.8% in Q4.
The implied exchange rate pass-through rate rises from 9% in 15Q1 to 36% at the end of the
year. Swiss-produced retail prices fell by less than 1% cumulative in 2015 (i.e. the implied
pass-through rate is less than 10%).29


4.2           Currency of invoicing, border prices, and retail import prices

We document the differential response of retail prices according to the EUR invoicing share
of the corresponding border product category. To do so, we consider panel regressions of the
form
                             pret
                              it =            s × Is=t × EU RShareg(i) + t + i + it                                  (3)
                                     s=14Q4

over the period t = 13Q1, ..., 16Q2, where g (i) denotes the border category associated with
retail product i, EU Rshareg(i) denotes the fraction of border prices in category g (i) invoiced in
EUR across all quarters in 2014, t is a time fixed effect, and i is a product fixed effect. In all
cross-sectional regressions using retail price data, observations are weighted by expenditures
in 2014 and standard errors are clustered at the level of retail product classes.30

 Notes: This figure reports estimates of t from equation (3), for all imports (left panel) and Swiss-produced
 goods (right panel). The dependent variable is good log retail price by quarter. Independent variables
 include time dummies, time dummies interacted by EUR invoicing intensity in 2014 of the corresponding
 border category, and EAN fixed effects. Whiskers indicate the bounds of a 95% confidence interval, calculated
 clustering at the level of retail product class.

      Figure D.1 in the appendix shows similar (but more volatile) patterns based on monthly prices relative
to December 2014. Figure D.2 in the appendix shows that import prices from the EU fell slightly more than
prices of all imports.

      We cluster by retail product class because it is the level of variation of regressors in many of the regressions
below. In the appendix we report for the main results specifications that cluster standard errors at the level
of border product categories.

Figure 5 displays estimates of t for imported goods (left column) and Swiss-produced goods
(right column). Table D.1 in the appendix reports estimates and standard errors by quarter, as
well as the average effect (imposing a common  ) in the first three quarters of 2015. For both
imports and domestic goods, there are no significant pre-trends in the period 2013-14. For
domestic goods, estimates of t in 2015-16 are negative but small and statistically insignificant.
For imported goods, estimates of t are negative and much larger than for domestic goods,
significant at the 1% level in 15Q1, at the 5% level in 15Q2, 15Q3, and 16Q1, and at the
10% level in 16Q2. For 15Q4, the estimate is negative but less tightly estimated. These
estimates imply that retail prices decline by roughly 7.3 percentage points more in 15Q1 for
goods belonging to border product categories that are (hypothetically) fully invoiced in EUR
compared with goods in product categories (hypothetically) fully invoiced in CHF currencies.
The estimated average effect in the period 15Q1-15Q3 is 7.8 pp. In Appendix D.2 we report
extensive sensitivity analysis.

We next leverage cross-product variation in price changes and in invoicing currencies at the
border to measure the sensitivity of retail prices of imported goods to changes in border
prices in the corresponding border product category. Specifically, for every quarter in 2015
we consider the regression


                         pret   ret              bor       bor
                          it - pi14Q4 = t + t × pg (i)t - pg (i)14Q4 + it ,                                (4)


over imported goods i, where pbor
                              g (i)t denotes the simple average of border prices at time t in
the border category associated with retail product i, g (i), and t is the average sensitivity of
retail prices to border prices across goods at time t. The rate of pass-through from border
prices to retail prices, t , reflects a combination of changes in the cost of distribution services
and changes in retail markups.

Given the concern that other drivers of retail prices in 2015 (such as category-specific demand
shocks) may be correlated with border prices, we instrument border price changes in 2015 by
the fraction of EUR-invoiced products in border category g (i) in 2014, EU RShareg(i) . This
instrument is valid if EUR invoicing shares by product category in 2014 are uncorrelated with
other category-specific drivers of retail price changes in 2015 including (i) shocks to product
demand or retail costs, and (ii) good-specific sensitivity of retail prices to border prices. Note
that this restriction does not require that EUR invoicing shares in 2014 are uncorrelated with
border price exchange rate pass-through in 2015 -- in fact, our instrument builds on this
correlation.31
  31
     Wooldridge (1997) provides a detailed discussion of 2SLS in models with random coefficients (in our
setting, variation in t across goods: g(i)t = t + vg(i)t ). In addition to the standard exclusion restriction,
consistency of 2SLS requires that vg(i)t is conditionally mean independent with respect to EU RShareg(i) ,
and that the covariance between vg(i)t and pbor          bor
                                               g (i)t - pg (i)14Q4 is conditionally independent with respect to
EU RShareg(i) (but this covariance need not be zero).


                                                      20
While we believe that this instrument somewhat alleviates endogeneity concerns, we cannot
a priori rule out violations of the exclusion restriction. For example, one could build a model
featuring variation in additive retail distribution costs across product categories in which, as
in Corsetti and Dedola (2005), the level of retail distribution costs shapes border to retail
price pass-through as well as desired exchange rate to border price pass-through. In this
case, the exclusion restriction would be violated if the choice of invoicing between EUR and
CHF in 2014 was endogenously determined by desired exchange rate pass-through, since
product categories with higher retail distribution costs would feature lower border to retail
price pass-through and more CHF invoicing.32

Table 6 reports OLS and 2SLS estimates of (4) for each quarter in 2015. Based on OLS, retail
import prices fall by roughly 0.53 pp more in product categories with a 1 pp larger decline
in border prices in 15Q1, and by 0.47 pp more in 15Q2. In the third and fourth quarters,
the estimates are around 0.35, but less tightly estimated. The positive co-movement between
border and retail import prices suggested by these OLS estimates is a feature of the data not
only after January 2015 and, more importantly, does not establish a causal impact of border
to retail import prices.33

The first stage of the 2SLS is significant in the first three quarters of 2015 (see F-statistic
reported in the bottom row), as revealed also by estimates of equation (2) displayed in Table
4. The estimated 2SLS estimates of t are 0.61 in 15Q1 and 0.57 in 15Q2 with standard errors
of roughly 0.2. The point estimate in 15Q3 is 0.95 (with a standard error of 0.3) and the
   32
      If distribution cost inputs and imported goods are combined in a Cobb-Douglas fashion (rather than
additive), then the level of retail distribution costs shapes border to retail pass-through but not exchange rate
to border price pass-through. So, in this case the exclusion restriction would not be violated.
   33
      Estimating the OLS relationship between changes in border and retail import prices in each quarter of
2013 and 2014 (a period of EUR/CHF stability) relative to the fourth quarter of 2014 results in three quarters
(out of a total of 7) with positive and significant coefficients. Moreover, all 2SLS estimates are close to zero
and not statistically significant.

estimate in 15Q4 is insignificant.34 In Appendix D.3 we report a range of sensitivity analysis.


4.3    Invoicing, import penetration, and retail prices of domestic goods

Whereas there is at most a weak relationship between changes in prices of Swiss-produced
goods and the EUR invoicing share (see Figure 5 above), we next show that this relationship is
stronger once we condition on the expenditure share of competing imported goods in the same
product category. We argue that, under certain exclusion restrictions and in combination with
estimates of co-movement between Swiss-produced and import retail prices, these results point
to the presence of pricing complementarities between domestic and imported retail products
(i.e. domestic producers react to changes in price of competing imported retail products).

We consider panel regressions of the form


        pret
         it =            Is=t × ImpShareg(i) × s + s × EU RShareg(i) + t + i + it ,                     (5)
                s=14Q4


for imported goods and domestic goods separately, where ImpShareg(i) denotes the import
expenditure share in retail category g (i) calculated over 2014. We include in the regression
the interaction between import shares and EUR invoicing share because we expect a higher
sensitivity of domestic prices to import prices in product categories with a large participation
of imported products, as in the model of variable markups we consider in Appendix D.6.

Figure 6 presents estimates of t for imported goods (left panel) and Swiss-produced goods
(right panel). Table D.17 in the appendix reports estimates and standard errors by quarter, as
well as the average effect in the first three quarters of 2015. While estimates of t in 2013-14
are largely insignificant, they are negative and significant in 2015 not only for imports but
also for Swiss-produced goods. Evaluated at the median import share of 23% across product
categories, our point estimates imply that retail prices of domestically produced goods decline
in 15Q1 (Q2 and Q3) relative to 14Q4 by 2.7 pp (3.8 and 5.6) more for goods in border product
categories that are (hypothetically) fully invoiced in EUR compared with goods in product
categories fully invoiced in CHF. In Appendix D.4 we report sensitivity analysis.




  34
     2SLS estimates throughout the cross-sectional regressions can be higher or lower than OLS estimates.
On the one hand, measurement error in prices and invoicing shares can lead to attenuation bias, while on the
other hand endogeneity can lead to upward biases in OLS estimates.

 Notes: This figure reports estimates of t from equation (5), for imports (left panel) and Swiss-produced
 goods (right panel). The dependent variable is log retail price by quarter. Independent variables include
 time dummies, time dummies interacted with import expenditure shares in 2014 of the corresponding product
 class, time dummies interacted with the product of import expenditures by product class and EUR invoicing
 intensity by border category in 2014, and EAN fixed effects. Whiskers indicate the bounds of a 95% confidence
 interval, calculated clustering at the level of border product category.



Motivated by these results, we aim to estimate the sensitivity of retail prices of Swiss-produced
goods to changes in retail prices of imported goods in the same retail product category. For
every quarter in 2015, we consider a regression of the form

                                                        retimp    retimp

over Swiss-produced goods i, where pretimp
                                    g (i)t denotes average retail price of imports in product
class g (i) (weighted by 2014 expenditures). The coefficient t captures the average sensitivity
of retail prices of Swiss-produced goods to changes in retail prices of imported goods in the
corresponding product category at time t.

OLS estimates of t , shown in Table 7, are positive in every quarter of 2015 with varying
statistical significance, implying that prices of domestically produced goods fall by more
in product categories with larger price reductions of retail prices of imported goods. This
is not necessarily evidence of strategic complementarities in pricing between domestic and
competing foreign products since domestic and import prices within a product category could
also co-move due to correlated changes in demand or production costs.35

In the absence of direct measures of domestic marginal costs that we can use as a control,

   35
     Since products in our sample consist mostly of non-durable final consumer goods such as shampoo, cheese,
and mineral water, it is unlikely that domestically produced goods within a product category make intensive
intermediate input use of imported goods in the same product category. However, domestically produced and
imported goods within a product category may employ common inputs in production that induce a correlation
in cost changes, as in Amiti et al. (2019).

variable is the product of import expenditure share in 2014 and the change in retail import prices over the
same time horizon for the corresponding product class, ImpShareg(i) × pretimp g (i)t . Under 2SLS, the import
share-interacted change in retail import prices is instrumented by the import share-interacted EUR invoicing
intensity in 2014 of the corresponding border category. Standard errors are clustered at the level of retail
product class.


we address the endogeneity concern by instrumenting ImpShareg(i) × pretimp    retimp
                                                                    g (i)t - pg (i)14Q4
by ImpShareg(i) × EU Rshareg(i) , where these shares are calculated in 2014. The exclusion
restriction, following the same logic as in the discussion after equation (4), is that the product
of import share and EUR invoicing share by product category in 2014 is uncorrelated with
other category-specific drivers of domestic retail price changes in 2015 including (i) shifts in
product demand or in production costs, and (ii) good-specific sensitivity of domestic retail
prices to import retail prices. This restriction does not require that EUR invoicing in 2014 is
uncorrelated with border price exchange-rate pass-through in 2015.

Once again, we cannot a priori rule out violations of the exclusion restriction. However, the
weaker relationship between EUR invoicing shares and domestic retail price changes in 2015,
unless we interact it by import share of final goods in the corresponding category, casts some
doubt on the hypothesis that Swiss-produced goods in EUR-invoiced categories use more
imported inputs, which would violate the exclusion restriction.36 Similarly, suppose that the
exclusion restriction was violated because the sensitivity of domestic retail prices to import
retail prices is higher in product categories with higher border price pass-through, which
also shapes the choice of invoicing between EUR and CHF in 2014. Then we would expect
a stronger relationship between EUR invoicing shares and domestic retail price changes in
2015, even without conditioning on import shares.

2SLS estimates of t , reported in Table 7, are positive with significance varying by quarter
   36
      Figure D.5 in Appendix D.6 shows that there is very little Swiss value added contained in imports from
the euro area, both for the aggregate of manufacturing industries and for the food, beverage, and tobacco
industries (which are more closely related to the set of final consumption goods examined in this paper).
These low shares speak against the possibility that marginal costs (and prices) of Swiss producers and foreign
exporters are correlated due to local and foreign firms using identical Swiss inputs. Unfortunately, we do not
have a good measure of the Swiss share of imported intermediate inputs by industry.

(10% in Q1, 5% in Q2 and Q4, and 1% in Q3). Based on Q2 and Q3 estimates, the decline
in domestic prices is roughly 0.3 pp larger in product categories with the median import
share and 1 pp larger decline in retail import prices. In Appendix D.5 we report a range of
sensitivity analysis.


4.4     Invoicing and the extensive margin of retail prices

We next examine how the degree of retail price stickiness responded to the CHF appreciation.
The decline in retail import prices in 2015 is partly accounted for by a large increase in the
fraction of nominal price changes, which can itself be decomposed into an increase in the
frequency of negative price changes and a decrease in the frequency of positive price changes.
We first provide aggregate time series and then examine the cross-sectional relationship with
currency of invoicing at the border.

We do not construct a measure of price flexibility at the level of individual goods and stores
because, at such a disaggregated level, our scanner data are very sparse over time. Instead, we
aggregate prices for each good i, region r, retailer s, and month t according to the modal price
across households, weeks, and stores within the quadruplet irst. We then calculate, for each
good i, year y = 13, 14, 15, and monthly horizon h = 1, ..., 12, the fraction of region-retailer
tuples for which the modal price in month h of year y differs from the modal price in December
of the previous year. We denote this fraction by fiyh . We further decompose the fraction of
                                                                            +      - 37
price changes into the fraction of increases (+) and decreases (-): fiyh = fiyh + fiyh .

The top row in Figure 7 displays the fraction of modal price changes fiyh averaged across
goods (weighting goods by expenditures in 2014) for imports (left panel) and Swiss-produced
goods (right panel). For every monthly horizon in 2013 and 2014, the degree of price flexibility
is similar for imported goods and for Swiss-produced goods. The fraction of price changes is
roughly 20% at the one-month horizon in 2013 and in 2014. That is, modal prices change in
roughly 20% of region/retailer pairs between December 2013 and January 2014 (and between
December 2012 and January 2013). This fraction rises to roughly 40% at 12-horizons in 2013




   37
      More formally, let pirshy denote the log of the modal price across households, weeks, and stores within
region r, retailer s, month h, year y , and let piyh be the average of pirshy over r, s pairs. Changes in log prices
between December of year y - 1 and month h of year y are piyh - piy-1,12 = fiyh × siyh where fiyh is the fraction
of r, s observations with non-zero price changes in this time period, and siyh is the average size of non-zero price
changes. Note that, in the presence of temporary price changes, fiyh does not need to increase monotonically
                                                                                 +             -      -
over time. We can further decompose changes in prices as piyh - piy-1,12 = fiyh     × s+                           +
                                                                                        iyh - fiyh × siyh , where fiyh
   -
(fiyh ) denotes the fraction of observations with a price increase (decrease) between month t and December of
                                -
the previous year, and s+ iyh (siyh ) denotes the average size of these price increases (decreases).

In 2015, at every monthly horizon, the average fraction of modal price changes for imported
goods rises significantly compared with 2013 and 2014. At the one-month horizon, the average
fiyh for imports rises from 20% in 2013-14 to 30% in 2015. At the 12-month horizon, it rises
from 40% to 60%. In contrast, there is little change in the fraction of price changes by time
horizon for Swiss-produced goods.

The increase in the fraction of price changes for imported goods following the January 2015

    38
       Figure E.2 in Appendix E.1 displays the monthly fraction of price changes from one month to the other
between 2013 and 2016. The fraction of price changes per month is on average roughly 0.2. Nakamura and
Steinsson (2008) report that the average monthly fraction of price changes (inclusive of sales) in the US CPI
is roughly 0.25 for all goods and for processed food goods, and 0.21 for household furnishings. The fraction of
price changes is roughly half as large when sales are excluded, as is the case in our retail price data when we
exclude temporary price reductions.


                                                        26
appreciation is almost completely driven by price reductions. The bottom row in Figure 7
                        -
shows that the average fiyh rises from roughly 10% in 2013 and 2014 to roughly 40% in 2015
at either the one-, the two, or the three-month horizon. The fraction of price decreases at
longer horizons is also much higher in 2015 than in 2013 or 2014. This suggests that the 2015
price reductions were not short-lived sales. Figure E.1 in the appendix shows that there was
only a small decline in the fraction of price increases for imported goods.39

The evolution of retail price stickiness varies systematically across imported goods by currency
of invoicing and price changes at the border. The impact of the appreciation on the extensive
margin and especially on the fraction of price reductions was more pronounced in border
product categories with higher EUR invoicing shares. For a given monthly horizon h, we
consider panel regressions of the form

               +       -
              fiyh or fiyh =              y h × Iy =y × EU RShareg(i) + yh + ih + iyh .                        (7)
                               y =13,15


The dependent variable is either the fraction of price increases or the fraction of price decreases
by product. yh and ih denote year and product fixed effects, respectively, that can vary by
monthly horizon h.

Table 8 reports estimates of 13h and 15h for price decreases (-) and increases (+), separately
for imports and Swiss-produced goods. We consider monthly horizons h = 1, 2, 3, since these
horizons experience the largest changes in aggregate fractions of price changes. We report
results for h = 4, 5, 6, as well as other sensitivity analysis in Appendix E.2.

Consider our estimates for 2015. For price reductions, estimates of 15h are positive and
significant at the 1% level in each of the horizons we consider. At the three-month horizon
(between December and March), the fraction of price reductions is 57.4 percentage points
higher in 2015 (compared with the same three-month horizon in 2014) for goods in product
categories with border prices that are (hypothetically) fully EUR-invoiced compared with
product categories fully invoiced in CHF. For price increases, estimates of 15h are negative
and significant at the 1% or 5% levels, depending on the monthly horizon. That is, the
fraction of price increases fell by more in 2015 (compared with 2014) for imported goods in



   39
     In Appendix E.1, we document that, accompanying the increase in the fraction of price reductions of
imported goods, there was a significant decline in the absolute size of retail price reductions for imported
goods in early 2015. We then show in Appendix E.4 that a simple Ss pricing can generate this seemingly
puzzling negative co-movement between the change in the frequency of price adjustment and the change in the
absolute size of price changes of imported goods. Specifically, in response to a decline in the CHF-denominated
cost of imported goods, the absolute size of price reductions falls if new price changes (i.e. those that would not
have occurred in the absence of the shock) are sufficiently small relative to the size of typical price reductions,
which depends on the assumed distribution of idiosyncratic shocks.

product categories with more EUR invoicing.40

For Swiss-produced goods, in contrast, estimates of 15h are not significantly different from
zero for either the fraction of price decreases or the fraction of price increases. Similarly, our
estimates for 2013 are small and largely insignificant, suggesting that there are no pre-trends in
the relationship between the fraction of price increases or decreases and currency of invoicing
of border prices between 2013 and 2014.

We further show, in Appendix E.3, that the extensive margin of retail price adjustment for
imported goods is strongly associated with changes in border prices in the corresponding

   40
     Point estimates for price increases are lower in absolute terms than those for price decreases. For example,
at the three-month horizon, 15h = 0.57 for price decreases whereas 15h = -0.36 for price increases. This
is consistent with the fact, shown in Figure 7, that the overall fraction of price changes rose in 2015. In
Table E.2 in the appendix we report estimates of equation (7) based on the overall fraction of price changes,
         +      -
fiyh = fiyh + fiyh , as the dependent variable. Estimates of 15h are positive, which is consistent with the fact
that point estimates are higher in absolute terms for the fraction of price decreases than for the fraction of
price increases, but only statistically significantly different from zero at the two-month horizon.

product category. Under both OLS and 2SLS (instrumenting border price changes by 2014
EUR invoicing shares in the corresponding border category), we show that categories with
a larger border price reduction in 2015 display significantly more price decreases and fewer
price increases.



5     Expenditure switching to imports

In this section we show that the changes in relative prices described above are associated
with changes in retail expenditures on imported goods. We document the dynamics of the
aggregate import share and then examine variation across individual goods.


5.1    Aggregate import share

We denote the aggregate import share by Syh , defined as the sum of expenditures on imports
over h = 1, ..., 17 months starting in January of year y = 2013, 14, 15 relative to the sum of
expenditures on imports and Swiss-produced goods over the same time horizon. We compare
import shares across years over comparable time horizons, rather than comparing monthly or
quarterly import shares relative to the last month or quarter of 2014, due to seasonalities of
imports in our data.41

Figure 8 documents that aggregate import shares in 2014 are similar to those in 2013 for
each time horizon. In 2015, there is a clear increase in import shares at each time horizon,
even in the early months after the CHF appreciation. As shown in Table 9, the rise in the
import share over different time horizons (corresponding to our quarterly price measures)
ranges between 0.8 and 1.3 percentage points relative to the average between 2013 and 2014,
or between 3.1 and 4.9 log percent differences. The increase in the import share is larger at
longer time horizons.42




   41
      We display in Appendix F.1 import shares by month. In constructing Syh , our choice of the longest
horizon, h = 17, is based on the latest month in the Nielsen dataset, May 2016. For h > 12 and y = 14, we
include the first (h - 12) months of the year rather than including post-appreciation months in 2015. Recall
that in our baseline we consider products that can be matched to border product categories with more than
7 border prices per quarter in 2014. We report in the appendix results based on more and less restrictive
product-category samples.
   42
      As shown in Table A.1 in the appendix, while real imports of goods and services rose in 2015, the ratio of
aggregate nominal imports to GDP fell (in contrast to the rise in the aggregate import share for non-durable
consumer goods in our data). Blaum (2019) examines how the response of intermediate goods imports (which
are not included in our data) to exchange rate movements may differ from that of final goods imports.

 Notes: This figure reports the aggregate import share, Syh , for years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and horizons
 h = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 months. The aggregate import share is the total sum of expenditures on imported goods
 over the corresponding monthly time horizon in the year divided by the sum of total expenditures (imports
 and Swiss-produced goods) over the same time period.



The increase in the aggregate import share is partly accounted for by an increase in import
shares within product categories and partly by reallocation of expenditures across product
categories. The within component, calculated by fixing the weights of individual product
categories at the level of import expenditures in 2014 (reported in Table 9), is between 45%
and 70% as large as the overall increase in the aggregate import share. The within component
is quantitatively more important at longer time horizons.

How large are changes in aggregate import shares compared with changes in relative prices?
We calculate the log change in relative prices as the log change in import prices minus the
log change in prices across all goods (weighing imports and Swiss-produced goods by 2014
expenditures). For import prices we use changes in either border prices or retail prices, as
described in the previous section. We then calculate the ratio of log differences in aggregate
import shares with respect to log changes in relative prices by monthly time horizon in 2015.

As shown in Table 9, based on retail import prices, this ratio is 5.4 at the three-month horizon
and ranges between 2.4 and 2.9 at horizons longer than three months. In contrast, based on
border import prices this ratio ranges between 0.6 and 1. The ratio of import share changes
relative to relative price changes is smaller based on border prices because retail import prices
fell by much less and more gradually than border prices. This pattern is especially pronounced
at the three-month horizon. The cross-sectional results that follow below display a similar

columns report, in turn, the 2013-14 average import share, the 2015 average import share, and the log-percent
difference between 2015 and 2013-14. The next three columns repeat the first three columns weighting product
categories by import expenditures in 2014. The last two columns report the ratio of log changes in aggregate

5.2    Changes in import shares and currency of invoicing at the border

We next analyze variation in import share changes across goods and relate these to invoicing
currency. We then leverage this cross-sectional variation to provide an alternative measure of
sensitivity of import shares to relative prices.

We first estimate the relationship between changes in expenditure shares on imported goods
within product categories and pre-shock EUR invoicing in the corresponding border category.

For this, we define the share of expenditures on imported good i within its retail product
class, Siyh , as the sum of expenditures on good i over h months starting in January of year
y = 2013, 14, 15 relative to the sum of expenditures on imports and Swiss-produced goods
in retail product class g (i) over the same time horizon. We consider panel regressions of the
form
                      siyh =              y h × Iy =y × EU RShareg(i) + yh + ih + iyh ,                   (8)
                               y =13,15

for monthly horizons h = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 and imported goods i, where siyh = log (Siyh ). For
each horizon, we consider a balanced sample of products for which siyh is observed in all three
years 2013, 2014, and 2015.

We also consider a second version of equation (8) using import share-adjusted EUR invoicing
shares, 1 - ImpShareg(i) × EU RShareg(i) , both calculated in 2014. To understand this
formulation, note from equation (9) below that for a given change in the price of imports, the

                                                          31
magnitude of the change in the import price relative to the product category price is decreasing
in the import share. In the limit, in a product category with import share equal to 1, relative
import prices and import shares are constant over time. We use import share-adjusted EUR
invoicing shares as an instrument in the 2SLS regression below. Finally, we consider a third
specification in which, in addition to the interaction term, we also include 1 - ImpShareg(i) .

Notes: This table reports estimates of 13h and 15h from equation (8) for each monthly time horizon and
specification. The dependent variable is the log of expenditure share of each imported good within retail
product class. The independent variable is the EUR invoicing share (interacted with the 2013 or 2015 dummy)
in the upper panel, the EUR invoicing share times domestic expenditure share in the middle panel, and the
EUR invoicing share times domestic expenditure share and the domestic share on its own in the lower panel.
Standard errors are clustered at the level of retail product class.

Table 10 presents estimates of 13h and 15h for each monthly time horizon and specification.
Estimates of 13h are small and largely insignificant across all specifications and time horizons,

                                                     32
indicating no strong relationship between changes in import shares and EUR invoicing before
2015.

Estimates of 15h , in contrast, are positive and statistically significant at most horizons and
specifications. Our point estimates imply that the expenditure share of imported goods rises
by roughly 12% more in (hypothetically) fully EUR-invoiced categories than in categories
that are fully CHF-invoiced at three- and six-month horizons in 2015, significant at the 5%
and 1% levels, respectively. If we consider the interaction term in the regression in the bottom
two panels, estimates remain largely significant. Estimates using interacted invoicing shares
imply that, evaluated at the median import share of 23% across product categories in 2014,
the rise in expenditure shares of imported goods in fully EUR-invoiced categories relative to
CHF-invoiced categories ranges between 13% and 18% at three- and six-month horizons in
2015. We report sensitivity analysis in Appendix F.2.


5.3     Sensitivity of import shares to relative prices

To measure the sensitivity of import expenditure shares to relative import prices within a
product class, we consider the following regression
  si15h = h + h × pimp                       imp                                  dom
                   i15h - ImpShareg (i)14 × pg (i)15h - (1 - ImpShareg (i)14 ) × pg (i)15h + it ,               (9)

where for any variable xi15h , xi15h = xi15h - xi14h . We estimate this equation in the balanced
sample of all imported goods i for h = 3, 6, 9, 12 and, in the appendix, also for h = 15, 17.

In order to examine the sensitivity of import shares to prices at different layers between the
border and the retail levels, we consider three alternative measures of import prices, pimp
                                                                                        iyh and
category-level prices pimp
                       g (i)yh . First, we use border prices of the corresponding border category,
                     imp      imp                                imp      imp
pbor
 g (i)yh , for both piyh and pg (i)yh . Second, we use for both piyh and pg (i)yh a measure of retail
import prices given by `distribution services'-augmented border prices, pbor +dis 43
                                                                         g (i)yh .   Third, we
                                      imp                                            imp
use import retail prices, pret
                           iyh , for piyh and then construct category-level prices, pg (i)yh , as the
weighted average (using 2014 expenditures) of retail import prices within the corresponding
retail product class.

We consider two alternative measures of domestic prices, pdom
                                                          g (i)yh . First, we calculate a weighted
average (using 2014 expenditures) of retail domestic prices within the corresponding product
category. Second, we use an aggregate (as opposed to good-specific) price of domestic goods,



   43
       Specifically, we assume that retail import prices pimp         imp
                                                            iyh and pg (i)yh are weighted averages of border prices,
pbor
 g (i)yh , and an aggregate price index of private services (Private Dienstleistungen) in the Swiss CPI. We assume
a weight on border prices of 0.59 and on services of (1 - 0.59), where 0.59 corresponds to the average sensitivity
of retail import prices to border prices reported in Table 6 during 15Q1 and 15Q2.


                                                        33
given by the official CPI for Swiss-produced goods.44 For each specification of equation (9),
we report estimates of h based on each of the three measures of import prices and two
measures of domestic prices, resulting in a total of six estimates for each time horizon.

Motivated by the findings in Section 5.2, we leverage heterogeneity in pre-shock import
shares and EUR invoicing shares in border product category g (i) as driver of heterogeneous
responses of relative prices to the appreciation. We consider 2SLS estimations of equation (9)
where the first stage relates import-adjusted EUR invoicing shares in 2014, EU RShareg(i) ×
 1 - ImpShareg(i) , to relative price changes. The exclusion restriction, following the same
logic as in the discussion after equation (4), is that import-adjusted EUR invoicing shares in
2014 are uncorrelated with other drivers of retail quantity changes in 2015 including (i) shifts
in demand, and (ii) good-specific sensitivity of expenditures to prices. Once again, while we
believe that this instrument somewhat alleviates endogeneity concerns, we cannot a priori
rule out violations of the exclusion restriction.45

We report 2SLS estimates in Table 11. The first stage is highly significant, except for
the specification using the combination of good-specific retail import prices and product
category-specific retail domestic prices, for which F stats are around 6 at three-, six- or
nine-month horizons. F stats are higher (close to or above 10) when weighting all observations
equally (or when weighting observations equally within border product category) or when
using modal prices to aggregate prices within regions, retailers, and weeks, as reported in
Appendix F. For these alternative choices, point estimates of h are similar to our baseline.46

Estimates of h based on border prices as the measure of import prices are statistically
significant at the 1% level and close to 1 at three-, six-, and nine-month horizons, implying
that a 1% decline in the relative border price of imported goods is associated with an increase
in import shares (within product categories) of around 1%. Point estimates at nine-month or
higher horizons are slightly higher, close to 1.5. Point estimates are very similar under the
two measures of domestic prices.

When we consider distribution-augmented border prices as the measure of import prices, the
estimated sensitivity of import shares to relative import prices is higher than that based on

   44
      A rationale for this second measure of domestic prices based on the CPI for Swiss-produced goods
(Inlandg¨ uter) is that retail domestic prices by product category are the sum of an aggregate component
and measurement error. This second measure of domestic prices results in stronger first-stage power and point
estimates that are within confidence bands of those based on the first measure.
   45
      For example, one could build a model featuring endogenous invoicing currency choice that is based on
desired pass-through by exporters, and where the latter is related to the demand elasticity at the retail level,
which varies across product categories. Note, however, that in standard models of variable markups conditional
pass-through is determined not by the demand elasticity level but by the curvature of the demand elasticity.
   46
      We note that OLS estimates of h , reported in Table F.11 in the appendix, are close to zero and largely
insignificant. As discussed in Feenstra et al. (2018), OLS estimates of the elasticity of substitution between
domestic and imported goods may be downward biased due to measurement error in prices and endogeneity
from demand shocks that are correlated with prices.

Notes: This table presents estimates of h in equation (9), as well as first stage F statistics. The dependent
variable is the log change from 2014 to 2015 within a time horizon in the market share of good i in its retail
product class, si15h . The independent variable is the log change in the price of imported good i relative to
the product class price index, instrumented by import-adjusted EUR invoicing shares in 2014. To measure
changes in prices of imported goods, panel (a) uses border prices, panel (b) adjusts border prices for changes
in the official CPI for private services (assuming a weight on the latter of 41%), and panel c) uses retail prices
of imported goods. To measure changes in domestic prices, odd-numbered columns use a weighted average
of retail domestic prices within the corresponding product class, and even-numbered columns instead use the
CPI for Swiss-produced goods. Standard errors are clustered at the level of retail product class. Results for
15 and 17 month horizons are reported in the Appendix.


border prices. At the three-, six-, and nine-month horizons, estimates of h are close to 2,
with significance ranging between 1% and 5%. Estimates of h at longer horizons are close
to 2.5 with significance between 1% and 5%. The degree of expenditure switching is higher
because prices of private services, which we use to construct distribution-augmented border
prices, fall by less than border prices.

Next, we consider good-specific retail prices as the measure of import prices. This measure of
relative prices is closer to the measure one would use to estimate demand elasticities at the
retail level, but implies more noisy estimates (and weaker first-stage F stats using product
category-specific retail domestic prices) given the large degree of idiosyncratic movements in
good-level prices. Point estimates of h are higher than those based on distribution-augmented
border prices and subject to larger standard errors. The estimated sensitivities of import
shares to relative prices within a product category range between 3.8 and 5.8 if we use
good-specific domestic prices, with significance between 5% and 10% in the first nine-month
or less horizons. If we use aggregate domestic prices, estimates sensitivities range between
2.7 and 3.7 -- with lower standard errors and significance between 1% and 5% at 12-month
horizons or less. The point estimates based on the two alternative measures of domestic


                                                         35
prices are within the confidence intervals of each other. Finally, we note that point estimates
are larger at the three-month horizon (consistent with the aggregate results in Table 9), but
differences across time horizons are not statistically significant given large standard errors.

We report in Appendix F.3 additional sensitivity analysis of our 2SLS estimates. While the
magnitude and significance of the estimates differs across specific time horizons and measures,
the two main takeaways are quite robust. First, there is a significant degree of expenditure
switching away from domestic goods and to imports, observed both on aggregate import shares
and cross-sectional variation in import shares across individual goods. Second, in terms of
magnitudes, the sensitivity of expenditure shares to changes in relative prices (instrumented
by import-adjusted invoicing shares) is around one for the border-level measure of import
prices, and at least twice as high for the retail-level measure of import prices. Import shares
are more sensitive to relative prices at the retail level than at the border level due to a muted
decline in retail prices compared with border prices.



6    Taking stock

In this paper, we provide a range of facts on how prices and expenditures of consumer goods
in Switzerland responded to a unique exchange rate shock: the SNB's removal of the lower
bound on the EUR/CHF exchange rate on January 15, 2015. This policy change happened
against the backdrop of a stable macroeconomy and resulted in a large, unanticipated, and
lasting appreciation of the Swiss franc. To investigate its impact, we examine border data on
prices and invoicing, as well as household-level data on prices and expenditures of non-durable
consumer goods. This allows us to link currency of invoicing to border prices, retail prices,
and expenditure allocations at the consumer level.

We first document large differences in border price pass-through by invoicing currency in the
first year after the appreciation, even when conditioning on non-zero price changes. However,
differences dissipate at longer time horizons. These observations are consistent with models
of endogenous invoicing based on desired pass-through at early time horizons. Via simple
accounting exercises we argue that, given differences in desired pass-through across goods,
counterfactual shifts in currency of invoicing at the border have a bigger impact on the
aggregate rate of pass through than counterfactual changes in the degree of nominal price
stickiness.

Second, we show that differences across border product categories in price changes by invoicing
currency at the border carry over to consumer prices and allocations. Specifically, after the
appreciation, EUR invoicing at the border is associated with: (i) larger reductions in retail
prices of imported goods, (ii) larger increases (decreases) in the frequency of price decreases



                                               36
(increases) of imported goods, (iii) larger reductions in retail prices of Swiss-produced goods
(in categories with substantial import competition), and (iv) larger increases in import shares
in the corresponding product category.47

Third, leveraging the exchange rate shock and invoicing variation across product categories,
we measure the sensitivity of retail import prices to border prices at roughly 50% after two
quarters. We also measure the sensitivity of import shares to relative prices within product
categories at roughly unity based on border import prices, and at least twice as high based
on retail import prices. Elasticity estimates are higher using retail prices than using border
prices because of the muted response of retail prices compared with border prices. A similar
logic may apply for estimates of trade elasticities based on tariff variation.
Since we have limited our analysis to non-durable consumer expenditure data, we have
not focused on the aggregate impact of the 2015 CHF appreciation on the Swiss economy.
As shown in Table A.1 in the appendix, the growth rate of Swiss real GDP was lower in
2015 compared with 2013 and 2014, but other forces may have contributed to the observed
aggregate fluctuations. The measures that we provide may help discipline key elasticities
in general equilibrium models designed to perform counterfactuals on the macroeconomic
impact of nominal exchange rate movements. The 2015 CHF appreciation episode may also
be informative about additional margins of adjustment beyond consumer import expenditure
switching, including cross-border shopping and import substitution at the level of intermediate
goods.

     The last observation on allocations complements our findings in Auer et al. (2019) that EUR-invoiced
products experienced less of a decline in export values when compared with CHF-invoiced industries.
Interestingly, the link between invoicing and export response shown in Auer et al. (2019) is stronger at longer
horizons, whereas the link between invoicing and import share changes that we document in this paper is
stronger at shorter horizons.
