The Deregularization of Land Titles

                                          ABSTRACT

In the last years, several countries implemented policy interventions to entitle urban squatters,
encouraged by the results of studies showing large welfare gains from entitlement. We study a
natural experiment in the allocation of land titles to very poor families in a suburban area of
Buenos Aires, Argentina. Although previous studies on this experiment have found important
effects of titling on investment, household structure, educational achievement, and child health, in
this article we document that a large fraction of households that went through a situation at which
formalization was challenged (death, divorce, sale/purchase), ended up being de-regularized. The
legal costs of remaining formal seem too high relative to the value of these parcels and the
income of their inhabitants.

I. Introduction
In recent decades, many governments throughout the developing world have launched land
titling programs as part of their poverty alleviation and urbanization policies. Typically, these
programs involve issuing titles of public (or sometimes private) tracts of land to their current
occupants. Empirical studies of land titling have found that these programs have large
effects. A partial listing includes Jimenez (1984), Alston et al. (1996) and Lanjouw and Levy
(2002) on real estate values; Besley (1995), Field (2005), Goldstein and Udry (2008) and
Do and Iyer (2008) on investment; Banerjee et al. (2002) and Libecap and Lueck (2008) on
agricultural productivity; Field (2007) on labor supply; Galiani and Schargrodsky (2004) and
Vogl (2007) on child health; Di Tella, Galiani and Schargrodsky (2007) on the formation of
beliefs; and Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) on investment, household structure and
educational attainment. However, in most cases, these interventions have not been
accompanied by regulatory policies that ease the burden represented by the cost of
registering future ownership changes. Thus, as time goes by, and as the beneficiary
titleholders pass away, divorce or migrate, if these poor households cannot afford the costs
entailed in remaining formal, we will observe a gradual process of deregularization that will
eventually lead to a new need for costly public interventions.


The story of Griselda, who lives in the neighborhood under study, sadly illustrates the
process and social costs of deregularization. The parcel where she lives was titled to her
mother-in-law years ago. When her mother-in-law passed away, Griselda’s husband could
not afford to go through the costly inheritance process. Later on, the couple separated due
to the husband’s frequently violent behavior towards her. However, they could not afford the
legal costs of divorce proceedings either. Thus, they currently all live on the same parcel:
she lives in a house in the front with their two children, while he lives in another room built
further back on the same plot of land, and he still sometimes hits her. She cannot go
elsewhere to live, nor evict him, and they cannot afford to legally split the parcel or its sale
value, as it still is under the name of his deceased mother.


In this paper we document this deregularization process by exploiting a natural experiment
in the allocation of land titles to very poor families in a suburban area of Buenos Aires,
Argentina. We find that 28.8% of the titled parcels have become deregularized due to
unregistered intra-family (death, divorce, etc.) or inter-family (informal sales, occupation,

                                               1
etc.) transactions, between 21 to 12 years after titling. Moreover, irregular tenure
arrangements are being used in 77.9% of the properties that have changed owners. This
figure seems surprisingly high, given that these families have fought tenaciously for legal
land ownership, and that both our previous studies (Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2004 and
2010) and the literature on other cases point to the presence of strong positive effects from
legal titling.


One plausible explanation is that the legal costs of remaining formal are high relative to the
low value of these parcels (and the low income of these families). Moreover, a family may
need to incur these costs more than once over time. Thus, one possibility is that the
(potentially repeated) cost of remaining formal is too high in relative terms. In short, these
poor families may not be able to afford formality.


The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the natural experiment
and summarizes our previous results. Section III documents the process of deregularization.
In Section IV, we present a simple model for the choice of whether or not to regularize, and
discuss the role played by the cost of formalization. Section V outlines alternative legal
schemes that may help lessen the burden of these costs. Finally, the conclusions are
presented in Section VI.


II. A Natural Experiment on Land Titling and its Effects
This section describes the process involved in providing title to parcels located on an unused
tract of land on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. It will also summarize the main results reported
in our previous related studies. This process began in 1981 when a group of about 1,800
families took over a tract of unoccupied land in San Francisco Solano, approximately 16
miles south of the City of Buenos Aires. The squatters’ move to the area was organized by
a Catholic parish priest. The land was divided into small urban-shaped parcels in order to
help ensure that it did not become a shantytown. Although the squatters believed that the
land belonged to the government at the time of the occupation, it in fact consisted of thirteen
tracts of privately owned land.


During the time that the country was ruled by a military government, several attempts were
made to evict the squatters. However, with the return of democracy, the Congress of the

                                               2
Province of Buenos Aires passed Expropriation Law No. 10.239 of 1984. Under the terms
of that law, the government was to expropriate the land, compensate its owners and then
allocate the parcels to the squatters. The law also prohibited the squatters from selling the
property within the first ten years of having received the title to it.


However, the titling process turned out to be asynchronous and incomplete. Although the
offers made by the government were similar in terms of price per square meter, the owners
of eight tracts of land accepted the offer in 1986 but the rest did not. As a result, the first
eight tracts of land were transferred to the squatters who were living on them, and those
occupants acquired titles to the land in 1989 and 1991. In previous studies, these people
have been referred to as the “early treatment group”. The rest of the owners brought legal
action in Argentina’s slow-moving courts in the hope of obtaining larger buyouts. One of
these trials was concluded in 1998, and the squatters on the corresponding parcels obtained
legal tenure of the land; these people have been called the “late treatment group” in the
previous studies. The remaining squatters have not obtained titles to the land they occupy
and therefore constitute the control group.


Importantly, the squatters did not know which owners would surrender their land at the time
that they settled on it (in fact, they did not even know that the land was privately owned).
Moreover, the squatters did not participate in the lawsuits and could not have any influence
over whether or not the former owners would choose to accept the offer made by the
government. Titling was strictly a consequence of whether the former owners decided to
accept or to challenge the offer made by the government.


Still, a potential cause of concern is that the decision of some of the original landowners to
challenge the government’s compensation offer may have been based on differences in land
quality. However, Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) have shown that this was not the case.
They demonstrate that there are no systematic differences in observed land characteristics
or in pre-treatment household characteristics between the treatment and the control groups.
Thus, the allocation of land titles was exogenous to the squatters’ behavior, and to the
squatters’ and land characteristics.




                                                 3
The area affected by Expropriation Law No. 10.239 encompasses a total of 1,839 parcels.
1,082 of these 1,839 parcels are located in a contiguous set of blocks. The occupants of
419 of these parcels were awarded land titles in 1989, and an additional 173 occupants
were given titles in 1998. However, land titles are not available to the families living on the
410 parcels located on tracts of land that have not been surrendered to the government in
the course of the expropriation process. Finally, there are 80 parcels (non-compliers) that
were not titled because the squatters occupying them had not fulfilled some of the
registration requirements, had moved or had died by the time the titles were made available,
even though the original owners had surrendered these pieces of land to the government.


The law also covered another non-contiguous (but nearby) land that is currently called the
San Martin neighborhood, which comprises 757 parcels. These parcels belonged to one
owner who accepted the expropriation compensation package without suing, and titles were
offered to the squatters on this land in 1991. 712 of these parcels were titled, while the other
45 were occupied by non-compliers. For those who obtained titles, the ten-year restriction
on the sale of the land expired in 1999 and 2008 for those in the main area and in 2001 for
the San Martin parcels.1


Naturally, this setting allows for causal identification of the effects of land titling. The first
study to make use of this natural experiment (Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2004) focuses on
the effect of titling on child health. In that study, we found that titling has an impact on the
Weight-for-Height Z-Score, which is a short-term indicator of child health, but essentially no
impact on the Height-for-Age Z-Score, which is a long-term health indicator. Nevertheless,
we did find that titling notably reduces the teenage pregnancy rate, which is a serious
concern for the population under study.


In Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) we found that titling has significant and sizable effects
on different types of housing investment, such as quality of walls and roofs, amount of floor
space, likelihood of there being a concrete sidewalk, and overall household appearance.


1In our previous studies dealing with this natural experiment, we did not have the opportunity to
analyze the process of deregularization because the ten-year sale restriction imposed by the
expropriation law had not expired for some of the parcels at the time the data for those studies was
collected.

                                                 4
Furthermore, treatment has a significant effect on household structure. Titled homes have,
on average, almost one member fewer. This is primarily due to the fact that there are fewer
non-nuclear family members in the household, but titled household heads also have fewer
offspring. In addition, we find that children in titled households achieve better educational
results; for example, the probability of finishing secondary school is twice as great for
children in the treatment group than for those in the control group. These results indicate
that titling is likely to have a long-term impact on the welfare of future generations.
Nevertheless, we find that titling has very little impact on access to mortgage credit and no
effect on access to other types of credit and labor income.


Meanwhile, Di Tella, Galiani and Schargrodsky (2007) find that titling has a large and
significant effect on people’s beliefs. Individuals who hold title to their properties are more
likely to have more individualistic and materialistic beliefs which fit in with the workings of a
market economy. In fact, that effect is so large that the beliefs of treated individuals are
similar to the average of those of the population of the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan
area, despite the large differences that exist between these two groups.


III. Deregularization
The above-mentioned results appear to indicate that the prospects of success for land titling
interventions are bright. The policy used by the government has succeeded in achieving its
ultimate goal: increasing the welfare of the poor. However, as this section will show, there
were many instances at which, after the policy intervention, intra-family and inter-family
transactions were not formalized, and these events slowly led to lower rates of legal
ownership. We refer to this process as “deregularization”.


To explore this process, we use detailed information on legal ownership obtained from the
Office of the Under-Secretary for Land of the Province of Buenos Aires. We know all these
parcels were occupied at the very same time in 1981. We also know the exact year titles
were awarded. In addition, we carried out a survey in late 2010 on a random sample of 368
parcels which had been offered titles in 1989-91 (early titled), or 1998 (late titled).2 The
survey respondents were asked to identify the persons currently considered to be the “real”


2Gestion Urbana, an NGO that works in this area, carried out the surveys utilized for this research
and for our previous studies (see Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010).
                                                 5
owners of the parcel. In cases where the original and current owners, or the legal and current
owners differed, the respondents were asked to answer a series of questions designed to
provide information about the motives for these discrepancies and the formalization of
potential transactions (formal sales, informal sales, death intestate, divorce, separation
without divorce, further squatting, etc.). The deregularization process is then analyzed on
the basis of a comparison of de facto vs. de jure ownership information.


Some families, of course, have left the neighborhood after treatment, and the process of
attrition is actually one of the outcomes of interest for this study. Thus, we do not drop the
parcels where the occupants have changed over time from the sample. On the contrary, the
survey respondents were also asked about the full history of transactions of each parcel.
The responses to the questionnaire therefore indicate whether the occupants purchased,
rented, squatted, inherited, etc. and whether they completed the necessary legal procedures
for these transactions.


Informal transactions, however, are not totally paperless. Information provided by a real
estate office located near the study area indicates that the documentation used to prove
possession in the informal transactions which that office frequently processes include
addresses in the national ID, children’s school enrolment records, public utility bills, bills of
purchase of construction materials, and signed statements by witnesses. When transactions
are informal, rather than entering the transfer of title in the Land Registry (escritura), the
seller and buyer sign alternative documents (such as a cesión de la mejora, which transfers
what is built above a parcel, thereby acknowledging the lack of ownership of the land itself,
or a boleto de compra-venta, which is akin to a bill of sale for movable property).


In total, we have a sample of 368 responses, which are presented in the form of a decision
tree in Figure 1.3 In 63% (232) of the cases, there has been no change in ownership since
title had been awarded. In the other 136 cases, there were changes in ownership. Of these
136, in 97 cases there has been changes in ownership within the same family, and in 39 the
family occupying the parcel has changed.




3Detailed information on titling status for the full sample, early-titled sample and late-titled sample is
presented in Annex 1.
                                                      6
                         Figure 1. The Deregularization Process




The 97 intra-family ownership changes break down into 72 changes in ownership upon
death, 23 changes upon divorce, and 2 due to other reasons. When our survey respondents
were asked whether the families involved had followed the necessary procedural steps to
legally transfer ownership in these cases, it turned out that legal procedures were followed
in only 13.9% (10 changes) of the cases of death, 26.1% (6 changes) of the divorce cases,
and one of the other two cases. Thus, 82.5% of the intra-family transactions were not legally
processed.


Of the 39 cases of changes in the owner family, 33 were described as purchases and 6 were
cases of squatting. Only 13 of the 33 purchases were legally documented. Thus, 60.1% of
the inter-family ownership changes have not been formalized.


Considering both intra and inter-family ownership changes, only a few years after legal
titling, the legal owners of 28.8% of the parcels (106 of 368 parcels) were no longer the real

                                              7
owners. Figure 2 summarizes this information; also splitting the sample between early-titled
and late-titled parcels. For the early-treated families, who received their titles in 1989-91,
32.95% had become deregularized by 2010. For the late-treated households, who received
their titles in 1998, one quarter (25%) of them were deregularized by 2010. As expected,
there is a larger share of deregularized cases among the early-treatment group, as more
time has elapsed since titling.


                             Figure 2. Deregularization Rates




Figure 3 shows that, considering only the 136 cases for which there was a change in
ownership, 106 of them (77.9%) became deregularized. This percentage is similar for the
early and late titled. Thus, the difference between these two groups observed in Figure 2,
was due to a smaller percentage of transfers, not to higher formalization when those
transfers occurred.

         Figure 3. Deregularization Rates for Parcels with Ownership Change




At first sight, the results in terms of deregularization are somewhat surprising. Previous
evidence has shown that significant gains are associated with the possession of legal titles.
Moreover, as it has been documented in previous studies, squatters have fought hard for
the land that they are living on and have resisted attempts to evict them. Viewed from the
perspective of public policy, the phenomenon of deregularization raises an important
question that has a strong bearing on the evaluation of policy effectiveness. It has generally
been assumed that titling can have long-lasting effects; however, if legal ownership is lost,
some of these effects may vanish.


IV. A Simple Model of Regularization Choice and the Cost of Formalization
Our next objective is to describe the process of deregularization using a formal model of
regularization decisions. Our model has the following characteristics. We consider risk-
neutral owners who acquired their houses from legal titleholders and thus can regularize
their tenure at any point in time. Time is therefore continuous and indexed by 𝑡 ≥ 0. We
assume the value of the services provided by a titled home at any point in time to be 𝑣, and
                                               𝑣
regularization has a one-time cost of 𝑐 ∈ (0, 𝑟 ), where 𝑟 is the interest rate. Additionally, the

decision to regularize is irreversible.
                                                   9
First, we assume that the distribution of properties which have been transferred is 𝛿(𝑡), with
𝛿(0) = 0, lim 𝛿(𝑡) = 1. In our study, 𝛿(𝑡) is the probability that a sale, death, divorce, or any
           𝑡→∞

other event that implies transmission of property has occurred for a given parcel. For
simplicity, we assume that once a parcel has been transferred it will not be transferred again.
Additionally, we assume that at the time property is transferred, parcels are randomly
assigned a draw of the random variable 𝑥 with support [𝑥, 𝑥̅ ] ⊂ ℜ and a cumulative density
function 𝐹(𝑥) which satisfies 𝐹(𝑥) = 0 and 𝐹(𝑥) = 1. Under informality, owners enjoy only a
portion 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠) ∈ [0,1] of the services provided by the house, where 𝑠 > 0 is the time that
elapsed since the property was transferred. This function captures the costs associated with
informal tenure.


We assume the function 𝑝(. ) is continuous and differentiable with lim 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠) = 0, 𝑝(𝑥, 0) =
                                                                            𝑠→∞

1, 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝑠 (. ) < 0, and 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝑥 (. )|𝑠>0 > 0. Thus, the variable 𝑥 could be interpreted as an
indicator of how risky an occupant’s tenure over a parcel is under informality: a very low 𝑥
would denote a very adverse situation and indicate that the property is at risk, while a high
value signals the presence of relatively secure possessory rights. Furthermore, the partial
derivative of 𝑝(. ) with respect to 𝑠 can be interpreted as signaling an increasing level of risk
in time. We believe this assumption is reasonable given that the probability of ownership
disputes is likely to increase over time, since it may become harder to prove ownership as
time goes by because previous owners and evidentiary documentation may be more difficult
to find.


We can now develop an expression for the value of a home which has been transferred at
time 𝑡 and is regularized at time 𝑠 at the moment of transfer, which we will call 𝑉 𝑠 . This
expression is simply the present discounted value of the services provided by the house:


                               𝑠                        +∞
                    𝑉 𝑠 = ∫ 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠′) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠′ 𝑑𝑠′ + ∫        𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠′ 𝑑𝑠′ − 𝑐 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠
                           𝑡                        𝑠



Our first result is what determines the proportion of regularized homes. This result is
presented in Proposition 1.


                                               10
Proposition 1. Each household has a value 𝑡 ∗ which indicates the moment at which the
property is transferred, and a value 𝑠 ∗ which indicates the amount of time after transfer that
must elapse before the parcel is regularized. At a given point in time, a household will have
regularized tenure if 𝑡 ∗ + 𝑠 ∗ < 𝑡.


Proof. Given that 𝛿(0) = 0 and lim 𝛿(𝑡) = 1, all properties must be transferred at some
                                          𝑡→∞

time. We refer to this moment as 𝑡 ∗ .


Next, conditional on the parcel having been transferred, the owners must decide when to
regularize their tenure. Since the owner is risk-neutral, s/he is interested in choosing 𝑠 ∗ such
that s/he will maximize the value of 𝑉 𝑠 . Taking the derivative with respect to 𝑠 ∗ yields:


                                𝜕𝑉 𝑠                     ∗         ∗            ∗
                                     = 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠 ∗ ) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠 − 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠 + 𝑟 𝑐 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠
                                𝜕𝑠 ∗


We will consider interior solutions. Therefore, the condition that determines time of
regularization is:


                                                       𝑐
                                     𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠 ∗ ) = 1 − 𝑣⁄                                     (1)
                                                        𝑟



Furthermore, the second-order condition is:


                     𝜕 2 𝑉𝑡 ∗                                    ∗   𝜕𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠 ∗ )         ∗
                                = −𝑟[𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠 ∗ )𝑣 − 𝑣 + 𝑟𝑐] 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠 +               𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟𝑠
                     𝜕𝑠 ∗ 2                                             𝜕𝑠


The bracket is zero because of condition (1). Therefore, the previous expression is negative,
and the second-order condition for a maximum is met.


                     𝑣
Given that 𝑐 ∈ (0, 𝑟 ), the right-hand side of condition (1) must be between zero and one.

Since 𝑝(𝑥, 0) = 1, lim 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠) = 0 and 𝑝(. ) is continuous, we must have at least one solution
                     𝑠→∞
 ∗
𝑠 for the previous expression. Furthermore, since 𝑝(. ) is strictly decreasing in time, the
solution is unique. The assumptions also rule out 𝑠 ∗ = 0 and 𝑠 ∗ being arbitrarily large.


                                                       11
We note that according to condition (1) the moment in which the person decides to regularize
                                                               𝑐
depends only on the draw 𝑥 and on the magnitude of            𝑣⁄ .   We have already discussed the
                                                                𝑟
                                               𝑐
nature of 𝑥. On the other hand, the value 𝑣⁄ is a new element with a rich interpretation. If a
                                                𝑟

person has an asset from which she accrues interest 𝑣 at any point in time and this asset is
held in perpetuity, then the present value of this asset is 𝑣/𝑟. Hence, the denominator is the
                                                                          𝑐
value of the house when property rights are full. The magnitude 𝑣⁄ thus expresses the cost
                                                                           𝑟

of regularization relative to the value of the household. Now, we can re-interpret condition
(1) in these terms: this condition states that the time of regularization depends negatively on
          𝑐
the ratio 𝑣⁄ . That is, people are more likely to remain irregular when the cost of regularization
           𝑟

is high in terms of the value of the house.



Corollary 1. The proportion of regularized parcels out of the total parcels transferred at the
moment 𝑡 is:
                                      𝑡
                                     ∫0 𝐹(𝑥 ∗ (𝑡 − 𝑡 ′ )) 𝑑 𝛿(𝑡′)
                                                𝛿(𝑡)


where the function 𝑥 ∗ (𝑠) is the inverse of 𝑠 ∗ (𝑥), as defined by condition (1).



The preceding results indicate that only a portion of the owners will have secured their
property rights to their houses at any given point in time. Proposition 1 also yields some
intuition as to why owners may not regularize their tenure following changes in ownership:
they will not do so if their possession is secure enough, that is, if their 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠 ∗ ) is high.
According to our model, differences in the proportion of regularized households between
populations depend on the time since property was transferred but also on the draws 𝑥 of
both populations. Given that the proportion of irregular ownership is 82.5% for intra-family
transfers and 60.6% for inter-family transfers, we may speculate that intra-family transfers
carry a lower level of risk (a higher draw of 𝑥) than inter-family transfers.


One interesting result is that the model suggests that a failure to regularize tenure at the
outset does not necessarily mean that owners will not regularize their title in the future. Thus,
in the context of this model, we should view this decision as one of postponement, since, in
                                                    12
fact, all owners in the model will regularize their tenure at some point in the absence of
further transfers, though this is not necessarily a noteworthy result.4


We should also note that this result depends on the assumption that 𝑝(. ) decreases over
time. If this were not the case, then there would be a single value 𝑥 ∗ such that owners would
regularize if and only if 𝑥 < 𝑥 ∗ . In this setting, families would choose either to regularize at
the time of transfer or would never regularize at all. Nevertheless, there would still be a
portion of 1 − 𝐹(𝑥 ∗ ) of properties with irregular ownership, although this segment would be
time-independent.


As it was mentioned in the previous sections, there are different kinds of situations that lead
property owners to fail to regularize their tenure of their homes. If these owners no longer
have the chance to regularize, then we should expect to see no further welfare effects from
titling. However, if owners still have the chance to regularize their tenure in the future, then
this may become an additional source of welfare. To explore this avenue, we compute the
decision of when to regularize and incorporate this option into the value of services provided
by the parcel at time 𝑡 Є [𝑡 ∗ , 𝑡 ∗ + 𝑠 ∗ ]:5


                          𝑡 ∗ +𝑠∗                                        +∞
                                                        ′ −𝑡)                                ′ −𝑡)                    ∗ +𝑠∗ −𝑡)
             𝑉𝑡𝑂𝑃   = ∫             𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡′) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡           𝑑𝑡′ + ∫           𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡           𝑑𝑡′ − 𝑐 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡
                      𝑡                                                 𝑡 ∗ +𝑠∗



However, a house that was not titled by the government in the first place (and whose owner
therefore does not have the option to regularize it) has a value of:


                                                            +∞
                                                                                     ′ −𝑡)
                                           𝑉𝑡𝑁𝑇 = ∫             𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡′) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡            𝑑𝑡′
                                                        𝑡



The titling premium can be calculated as the difference between the previous two values.
The difference between an owner who acquired a house that was titled to the former legal

4   The assumptions that guarantee that full regularization will occur eventually are lim 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑠) = 0 and
                                                                                                                 𝑠→∞
𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝑠 (. ) < 0. The former is used to prove existence, while the latter is used to prove uniqueness.
However, these two conditions are sufficient but not necessary for the proof. Hence, full regularization
is not necessarily a feature of a more elaborate model.
5
  Note that 𝑡 > 𝑡 ∗ implies that property has already been transferred. Hence, the values presented in
this section are conditional on the transfer having taken place.
                                                    13
owner and someone who acquired a house by other means is essentially that the former
can regularize while the latter cannot. Thus, the option value measures the welfare gain
produced by the opportunity to regularize. Moreover, if the shock 𝑥 is known, a person who
wants to acquire the property should be willing to pay 𝑉𝑡𝑂𝑃 if the house can be titled, while
the person should be willing to pay 𝑉𝑡𝑁𝑇 if the house cannot be titled. Therefore, the titling
premium would give us an idea of the size of the welfare gains associated with the
possession of title.


That being said, we expect the size of the welfare gain to decrease with the cost of
regularization. This is because higher costs ultimately deter the owners from regularizing
their title and therefore should decrease the benefits of doing so. Proposition 2 shows that
this is effectively so.


Proposition 2. The welfare gain delivered by the option to regularize decreases in relation
to the cost of regularization.


Proof. We start the proof by writing the expression of the titling premium:
                              𝑡 ∗ +𝑠∗                                        +∞
                                                            ′ −𝑡)                                ′ −𝑡)                     ∗ +𝑠∗ −𝑡)
      𝑉𝑡𝑂𝑃   −   𝑉𝑡𝑁𝑇   = ∫             𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡′) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡           𝑑𝑡 ′ + ∫          𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡           𝑑𝑡 ′ − 𝑐 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡
                          𝑡                                                 𝑡 ∗ +𝑠∗
                                      +∞
                                                              ′ −𝑡)
                          − ∫             𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡′) 𝑣 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡           𝑑𝑡′
                                  𝑡
                                             +∞
                                                                                 ′ −𝑡)                       ∗ +𝑠∗ −𝑡)
                  𝑉𝑡𝑂𝑃 − 𝑉𝑡𝑁𝑇 = ∫                     𝑣 (1 − 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡′)) 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡            𝑑𝑡 ′ − 𝑐 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡
                                            𝑡 ∗ +𝑠∗



Now, we take the derivative of the previous expression with respect to 𝑐, taking into account
that 𝑠 ∗ is an implicit function of 𝑐 given by condition (1) in proof of Proposition 1. This gives:


         𝜕(𝑉𝑡𝑂𝑃 − 𝑉𝑡𝑁𝑇 )                                          ∗  ∗    𝜕𝑠 ∗         ∗  ∗
                         = [−𝑣 (1 − 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡 ∗ + 𝑠 ∗ )) + 𝑟𝑐] 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡 +𝑠 −𝑡)      − 𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡 +𝑠 −𝑡)
               𝜕𝑐                                                         𝜕𝑐


Note that if we consider 𝑠 ∗ as an implicit function of costs in condition (1), we get 𝑑𝑠 ∗ ⁄𝑑𝑐 >
0. Nevertheless, the bracket is zero because of this condition. Thus the titling premium
decreases as the cost of regularization rises.
                                                                                                                                       ∎
                                                                    14
Hence, the preceding result states that if the cost of regularization is high, the welfare gains
afforded by the ability to regularize title will be limited. Although this result was intuitive,
looking into the derivative shown in the previous proof gives us an idea of why this is so. We
                                                                                                   ∗ +𝑠∗ −𝑡)
see that there is a direct effect, given the higher cost of regularization, which is −𝑒 −𝑟(𝑡                   .
There is also an indirect effect, since the decision to regularize title is actually postponed.
However, this effect is second-order small, since the bracket is zero. This deferral will lead
to lower rates of regularization at any given point in time, although it does not affect welfare.


In our natural experiment, we can compare the cost of formalization (after death, divorce or
sale/purchase) relative to the value of these parcels. During the process of data collection,
we hired a real estate office located near the study area to measure valuations of the
dwellings at the parcel level.6 The average value of the parcels in our sample was AR$
46,824 (about US$ 11,700, at the time of the survey). According to this local realtor, the
price difference between houses in this area with and without legal titles is of approximately
20%.7 Moreover, information was sought from lawyers operating in Quilmes County
regarding the costs of various sorts of legal transactions. The cost of processing the
inheritance of an asset valued at US$ 11,700 is about US$ 2,300. The cost of the legal
purchase procedure for such an asset is about US$ 3,184. The legal cost of a divorce with
this asset is about US$ 2,440. The fact that a family might need to incur these costs more
than once over time also has to be taken into consideration. Thus, these legal costs are very
significant relative to the parcels value (i.e., c is high relative to v, in terms of our model).


These legal costs are also high relative to the income levels of these households. The
average monthly household head’s income in our survey is $AR 1,277 (about US$ 320),
and the average total household income is $AR 1,763 (about US$ 440). Likely, these
families do not have other sources of liquidity to afford the costs of formalization than their
own income.



6 This local real estate agency provided a valuation in Argentine pesos of each parcel. The valuation
was not performed in the San Martin parcels
7 Note that it is very difficult to properly estimate the land titling premium. First of all, there are few

real transactions so as to have enough degrees of freedom available. Second, because land titling
cause investments, it is needed to control for them to isolate the land titling premium, something also
very difficult since investments are themselves endogenous variables in a housing value equation.
                                                     15
In sum, titling costs are effectively very large in terms of average property value, titling
premium, and average income. Thus, one possibility is that the (potentially repeated) costs
of remaining formal simply outweigh the welfare benefits and titling premium, and that
therefore formalization may not be worthwhile. Legal and transactions costs may be one of
the main reasons for the high rates of deregularization found in our sample.


A similar argument may account for the low level of access to mortgage credit. In theory, the
possession of formal property rights could allow the use of land as collateral, improving the
access of the poor to the credit markets (Feder et al., 1988; De Soto, 2000). However, the
high legal cost of carrying out an eviction and of mortgage execution may preclude the use
of these parcels as collateral (together, of course, with the difficulties faced by this population
in meeting the associated credit requirements regarding individual documentation and
formal employment). Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) showed that these families enjoy little
access to formal credit, and a very modest effect of land titling on mortgage credit.


The costs of formalization may also be a relevant factor in other similar types of
interventions. When property rights are transferred to very poor people, preserving legal
tenure will likely entail onerous expenses in the form of attorney and public notary fees, and
court costs. In addition, these charges are higher in relatively terms in very unequal societies
where the gap between the poor and the relatively well-off is wider. In view of these concerns
regarding the high costs of regularization, the next section is devoted to a discussion of
alternative titling schemes that can ameliorate these effects.


V. Alternative Titling Systems
A large body of literature has documented the sizable positive effects associated with land
titling (see, for example, Shavell, 2004, and the survey by Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2011).
However, the evidence presented here shows that there is a tendency for owners not to
maintain the legal title to their property. This is a concern because the process of
deregularization can thus constrain some of the beneficial effects of titling. Furthermore, as
it has been shown in the preceding section, the costs associated with the legal transfer of
property are potentially one of the major reasons for the high rates of deregularization found
among our sample.



                                                16
This section will focus on legal alternatives which can lower the costs of transferring and
holding property and thus boost the benefits of these policy interventions. In practice, claims
on property can be documented in a registry that is actually public and therefore widely
accessible. According to Shavell (2004), the benefits of such a system are that they provide
assurance of ownership which has several advantages like discouraging theft, and reducing
information asymmetries in sales or when using property as collateral.


Regarding the formats these systems can take, Arruñada (2012) discusses two alternative
systems for the provision of public information on property rights. The first system is the
recordation of deeds, whereby a public registry provides information regarding the claims
associated with a property. Given that some of the information in these registries may be
redundant or contradictory, the records must be purged in order to determine who the right-
holder is. This task is carried out by professionals who thoroughly examine the claims and
issue a report that evaluates the quality of the property. If there are proper incentives for
recording claims, title reports will be accurate and the acquirer’s information asymmetry will
be reduced. Moreover, courts will allocate property on the basis of essentially the same
process in the event of litigation.


The next alternative discussed by Arruñada (2012) is the registration of rights. While
recordation provides information regarding claims, this information has to be processed in
order for it to become clear who the owner is. In contrast, registration directly defines who
the right-holder is. In order to do this, registration officials conduct mandatory purges of the
claims to a property before registering the rights to it. If a transaction does not affect the
rights of others, or if these other parties give their consent, then the transaction is registered
and the acquirer becomes the legal right-holder.


Therefore, the registration of rights is intended to reduce information problems to a minimum.
However, registration systems are often seen as entailing large fixed costs. On the other
hand, systems of recordation are generally regarded as being less expensive than
registration but may involve greater uncertainty. Hence, the choice between recordation and
registration depends on the trade-off between fixed costs and reliability. Arruñada and
Garoupa (2005) build a formal model along these lines that compares the two systems in
the presence of an outside option. Landowners have incentives to pick the outside option

                                               17
for low-value land, recordation for mid-value land, and registration for high-value land. When
only one of the systems is available, their results show that recordation leads to the under-
assurance of high-value land, while registration generates either under-assurance or over-
assurance in the case of mid-value land. The optimal choice between these two systems
ultimately depends on how these trade-offs stack up.


The Arruñada and Garoupa (2005) model offers some important lessons for our land titling
intervention in relation to the subsequent deregularization process. In the case under study,
the prevalent system is one of registration and the outside option is that of deregularization.
Given that the parcels in question are of relatively low value, it seems natural for people to
prefer deregularization. However, in the presence of a recordation system, many of these
properties would be legally recorded, and socially costly under-assurance would be avoided.


Some authors have challenged the idea that recordation is less costly than registration and
contend that the former system identifies rights more clearly (see Arruñada, 2012). However,
these objections do not target the systems per se; they are rather case-specific and partly
attributable to shortcomings in system design. We will therefore disregard these caveats
here.


We do not, of course, propose that the entire registration system be changed to address
problems that are specific to a subgroup of the population. However, specific property right
systems can be designed to target the problems faced by the poor. Regarding targeted
interventions, the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP, 2008)
emphasized that:


    Some countries have adopted simple, locally administered processes to confer legal land
    rights as alternatives to conventional land titling. They are practical, inclusive, benefiting
    growing populations of the rural poor, and are being increasingly used to enhance urban
    land tenure security.


For example, in the experiment studied here, the squatters’ ownership of the parcels at the
time of treatment was guaranteed by the specific expropriation law. Subsequent transfers of
property are likely to have involved unsophisticated forms of documentation, and bank

                                                 18
claims, such as mortgages, are rare. Thus, identifying right-holders should be relatively
straightforward as long as the transfers have been documented. In addition, institutions can
use paralegals, law students and recent graduates as a means of running the registry at a
lower cost.8 They can also provide complementary services that will simplify and reduce the
cost of procedures such as those involved in processing an inheritance or a divorce. These
kinds of approaches could potentially be used to help build a legal framework that is better
suited to the needs of the poor.


VI. Conclusions
In this study we have tracked the outcomes of an intervention in which property rights were
granted to poor people living on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. When 12 to 21 years had
elapsed since titling, 28.8% of the parcels allocated to the squatters became occupied under
irregular tenure arrangements due to unregistered intra-family transactions (death, divorce,
other) or inter-family transactions (informal sales, occupation, etc.). This figure seems
surprisingly high, given that these families fought tenaciously to obtain legal title to the land
and the presence of strong positive effects from legal titling, as studied on this natural
experiment in our previous papers (Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2004 and 2010) and by the
literature on other cases. Why have so many of these families allowed their title to their
parcels to become deregularized?


One main reason may be that the legal costs of remaining formal are too high relative to the
value of these parcels (and the income of these households). Thus, we looked into the
question as to whether lower-cost means of formalization could be achieved through
alternative legislation. Although we cannot provide definitive answers, it is likely that a
registration system would be unsuitable for the poor, given that low-value properties tend to
go unregistered. A system of recordation, on the other hand, could deliver cost reductions
which would ultimately boost the rate of regularization and enhance legal protection. All in
all, it is likely that complementary reforms aimed in this direction can increase the welfare of
the poor, and make the benefits of land titling more durable.
