Beyond Random Assignment: Credible Inference of Causal Effects in Dynamic Economies

                                             ABSTRACT

Random assignment is insufficient for measured treatment responses to recover causal effects (comparative
statics) in dynamic economies. We characterize analytically bias probabilities and magnitudes. If the
policy variable is binary there is attenuation bias. With more than two policy states, treatment responses
can undershoot, overshoot, or have incorrect signs. Under permanent random assignment, treatment
responses overshoot (have incorrect signs) for realized changes opposite in sign to (small relative to)
expected changes. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions, beyond random assignment, for
correct inference of causal effects: martingale policy variable. Infinitesimal transition rates are only
sufficient absent fixed costs. Stochastic monotonicity is sufficient for correct sign inference. If these
conditions are not met, we show how treatment responses can nevertheless be corrected and mapped
to causal effects or extrapolated to forecast responses to future policy changes within or across policy
generating processes.

1. Introduction

   The goal of most empirical work in economics is to estimate signs and magnitudes of causal
e¤ects (comparative statics). Correct identi…cation of causal e¤ect signs is critical given that
a theory may be viewed as falsi…ed if it incorrectly predicts a sign. For example, in claiming
to document a positive causal relationship between minimum wages and employment, Card and
Krueger (1995) write “If accepted, our …ndings call into question the standard model of the labor
market that has dominated economists’ thinking for the past half century.” Correct estimation
of causal e¤ect magnitudes is important since elasticities are key inputs in welfare analysis, thus
in‡uencing policy decisions. For example, based on low estimated tax-elasticities, Slemrod (1992)
and Aaron (1992) call for less attention to excess burdens. Angrist and Pischke (2009) point out
another role for causal e¤ects in stating, “A causal relationship is useful for making predictions
about the consequences of changing circumstances or policies; it tells us what would happen in
alternative (or ‘counterfactual’) worlds.”
   Angrist and Pischke (2010) herald the search for sources of random assignment as a “credi-
bility revolution” in overcoming the causal e¤ect identi…cation problem. They argue that “The
most credible research designs are those that exploit random assignment.” Their textbook, Mostly
Harmless Econometrics, states, “The goal of most empirical research is to overcome selection bias,
and therefore to have something to say about the causal e¤ect of a variable.”
   Inspired by the credibility revolution, a varied empirical literature exploits (quasi) random as-
signment in search of causal e¤ects in dynamic economies. Greenstone (2002) and Greenstone and
Chay (2005) exploit random air quality regulation to estimate causal e¤ects on …rm activity and
house prices, respectively. Deschenes and Greenstone (2007) use annual weather ‡uctuations to
infer causal e¤ects of long-term climate change on …rm pro…tability. An extensive public …nance
literature, e.g. Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994), treats tax code changes as natural experi-
ments. Romer and Romer (2010) identify exogenous tax changes to estimate their macroeconomic
e¤ects. Card and Krueger (1994) analyze minimum wage e¤ects using di¤erence-in-di¤erences.
Banerjee, Du‡o, Glennerster and Kinnan (2015) and Crepon, Devoto, Du‡o and Pariente (2015)
estimate causal impacts of microcredit programs on investment using random assignment. Gan
(2007) and Chaney, Sraer, Thesmar (2012) exploit real estate price ‡uctuations to estimate e¤ects



                                                 1
of collateral on investment. Werker, Ahmed, and Cohen (2009) use oil price ‡uctuations to identify
causal e¤ects of foreign aid.
   It might appear from the preceding discussion that the task of identifying causal e¤ect parame-
ters in dynamic economies is already a “mission-accomplished.” Indeed, in surveying the accom-
plishments of econometricians over the preceding millennium, Heckman (2000) writes:

         The major contributions of twentieth century econometrics to knowledge were the
     de…nition of causal parameters within well-de…ned economic models... [and] the analy-
     sis of what is required to recover causal parameters from the data (the identi…cation
     problem)...

   The preceding quotation notwithstanding, the set of identifying assumptions required for recov-
ery of causal e¤ect parameters in dynamic economies is not known. Rather, the same identifying
assumption invoked in static settings, random assignment, is informally invoked as the identifying
assumption in dynamic settings. For example, the textbook of Angrist and Pischke (2009) does not
devote any special attention to inference in dynamic economies, perhaps in the belief that dynamics
create no special issues. And such would be the inevitable consequence of a belief that selection is
the problem to be overcome in empirical work on causal e¤ects.
   The overarching objective of this paper is to complete the econometric mission-statement of
Heckman (2000) by deriving the required identifying assumptions for the recovery of causal e¤ect
parameters in dynamic economies. To accomplish this, we examine the relationship between causal
e¤ ects (comparative statics/di¤erentials) and measured treatment responses (empirically measured
responses to policy changes). We make four contributions. First, we show random assignment is
not generally su¢ cient for recovery of causal e¤ects in dynamic economies. Second, we characterize
analytically bias magnitudes and probabilities. Third, we derive sets of identifying assumptions,
beyond random assignment, that must be satis…ed in order to correctly identify causal e¤ect signs
and/or magnitudes. Finally, we provide an error correction algorithm facilitating correct identi-
…cation of causal e¤ects when the safe-harbor assumptions are not satis…ed. This algorithm also
allows one to recover policy invariant structural parameters in dynamic economies, and permits
extrapolation robust to the critique of Lucas (1976).
   We consider an econometrician seeking to empirically estimate the causal e¤ect parameters

                                                 2
implied by a canonical dynamic theory, the q-theory of capital accumulation under quadratic ad-
justment costs, e.g. Abel and Eberly (1997). Following Abel and Eberly (1994) and Chetty (2012),
we also allow for general convex adjustment costs, imperfect reversibility, and …xed costs of invest-
ment. The empiricist measures treatment responses with the goal of inferring causal e¤ects, as well
as policy-invariant structural parameters. Critical for our exercise is that here we know the true
causal e¤ect signs and magnitudes.
   We show that random assignment is insu¢ cient for valid inference in dynamic settings. Un-
doubtedly, some empiricists have a heuristic sense that transience clouds the interpretation of
econometric evidence. However, the direction, magnitude and probability of biases have not been
analyzed formally, and thus, are not well understood.
   Conventional wisdom holds that policy transience results in attenuation bias in the context
of real investment (see Slemrod (1992), Aaron (1992), Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994),
and Atanasov and Black (2015)). As we show, however, this conventional wisdom is only valid
only for limited scenarios. One such scenario is when the policy variable is binary, the focus
of early theoretical work. Another scenario generating attenuation bias is when policy variable
transitions are uniformly distributed. Even in such cases, the magnitude of the bias is not well
understood. For example, under plausible parameterizations, binary assignment and uniformly-
distributed assignment results in attenuation bias exceeding 50% even if the expected duration of
policy regimes is relatively long (10 years).
   As we show, if one considers more realistic empirical settings, with non-binary policy variables,
the set of econometric issues becomes far more pernicious. Here treatment responses can under-
state, overstate, and even have signs opposite to causal e¤ects. More importantly, the quantitative
implications are both surprising and troubling. Consider for example, an economy featuring a 5%
discount rate, an expected regime life of …ve years, with a future permanent policy variable change
drawn from the uniform distribution on [0,1]. Here, the econometrician will face attenuation bias
for 60% of the possible random treatments, those on [0.40,1]. For the remaining 40% of possible
treatments, those on [0,0.40), the treatment response is actually opposite in sign to the causal e¤ect.
If instead the treatments are drawn from the uniform distribution on [-0.20, 0.80], the treatment
response will overshoot the causal e¤ect with probability 20%, have the wrong sign with probability
24%, and undershoot with probability 56%. With skewed policy variable changes, the majority of

                                                  3
experiments can have the wrong sign. It is hard to understand the sense in which estimators with
such properties can be justi…ably described as “credible.”
   After diagnosing the inference problem arising from dynamics, the majority of the paper is
devoted to a constructive analysis of how the problems identi…ed can be addressed. We begin by
deriving a necessary and su¢ cient condition, beyond random assignment, which ensures equality of
treatment responses and causal e¤ects: martingale policy variable. This result holds in the presence
of convex adjustment costs, wedges between the buy and sell price of capital, and …xed costs of
investment. The intuition for the result is as follows. If the policy variable is a martingale, …rms
invest as if the current policy state will last forever, before and after each policy transition. This
allows the empiricist to directly recover causal e¤ects from measured responses to policy variable
transitions.
   Empiricists sometimes invoke the strong assumption that policy variable changes are completely
unexpected and permanent. Setting aside plausibility concerns, we show it is only valid as an
identifying assumption in the absence of …xed investment costs, which Abel and Eberly (1994) and
Chetty (2012) have ‡agged as an important friction. In particular, we show that with in…nitesimal
transition rates, the shadow value of capital under transient policy assignment approaches that
under permanent policy assignment. This implies treatment responses approach causal e¤ects, but
only in the absence of …xed costs, since …xed costs generate investment discontinuities.
   In certain cases, empiricists are less concerned about magnitudes, caring only to avoid incor-
rect estimation of causal e¤ect signs. Here we derive a battery of sign identi…cation assumptions
that empiricists can invoke: binary assignment; uniformly distributed policy transitions; stochastic
monotonicity of the policy variable; permanent random assignment opposite in sign to the expected
treatment; or permanent random assignment equal in sign but with absolute value in excess of the
expected treatment.
   Finally, we show how problems arising from policy transience can be addressed when the iden-
tifying assumptions stated above are not satis…ed. For example, we show how causal e¤ects can
be recovered from treatment responses for arbitrary policy transition rates. We also show how
treatment responses can be extrapolated across di¤erent transitions under the same policy gener-
ating process, or across di¤erent policy processes, overcoming barriers to valid extrapolation. The
proposed correction works as follows. Rather than focus on the change in the policy variable, with

                                                  4
policy transience one should instead focus on …rm responses to changes in the shadow value ac-
counting for expectations. With such estimates in-hand, one can then infer causal e¤ects or forecast
responses to future shadow value changes.
   Taken together, our results cast doubt on the interpretation and utilization of elasticity estimates
shaping policy. For example, implicit in much empirical work is the view that “more change is
better”since more observations drives down standard errors and facilitates control for …xed-e¤ects.
Slemrod (1992) writes, “Fortunately (for the progress of our knowledge, not for policy), since 1978
the taxation of capital gains has been changed several times, providing much new evidence on
the tax responsiveness of realizations.” Similarly, Greenstone (2001) writes “The [Clean Air Act]
Amendments introduce substantial cross-sectional and longitudinal variation in regulatory intensity
at the county level.”Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994) examine responses to 13 changes in the
U.S. corporate income tax from 1962 until 1986. Romer and Romer (2010) identify 54 exogenous
tax shocks during the post-war period.
   Lucas (1976) points out the perils of extrapolating macro-econometric evidence across policy
rules. Our focus is on the inadequacy of the random assignment assumption invoked by micro-
econometricians in estimating causal e¤ects. Naturally, Lucas does not analyze the relationship
between treatment responses under dynamic random assignment and causal e¤ects, nor derive
su¢ cient conditions for correct identi…cation of causal e¤ects.
   Abel (1983) analyzes e¤ects of permanent versus temporary tax policies under perfect fore-
sight. Auerbach (1986) and Auerbach and Hines (1988) present investment Euler equations under
stochastic tax rates. Hassett and Metcalf (1999) present a real options model with a one-time
investment which they use to assess whether uncertainty regarding tax credits encourages invest-
ment. Gourio and Miao (2008) numerically compare e¤ects of permanent and temporary dividend
tax cuts. Keane and Wolpin (2002) show accounting for policy duration is important if households
are forward-looking. For example, in their model, a soon-to-expire child bene…t should have no
e¤ect on fertility absent income e¤ects. Their analysis is granular, accounting for welfare program
detail, and numerical.
   Our work is in the spirit of a paper by Chetty (2012) who writes, “The identi…cation of structural
parameters of stylized models is one of the central tasks of applied economics.” He analyzes how
to recover structural elasticity parameters if there are transaction costs or inattention. We use a

                                                  5
structural model to understand and correct empirical estimates derived from random assignment
in dynamic settings, with recovery of adjustment cost parameters being an interim step. Cummins,
Hassett and Hubbard (1994) estimate adjustment cost parameters based on tax experiments. They
assume each tax change is a complete surprise and viewed as permanent.
      The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the neoclassical theory and derives causal
e¤ects. Section 3 discusses the econometric inference problem. Section 4 examines the relationship
between causal e¤ects and measured treatment responses. Section 5 o¤ers bias corrections. Section
6 derives identifying assumptions for dynamic economies. Section 7 discusses extrapolation. Section
8 provides a numerical example. Section 9 concludes, and the appendix contains all proofs.

2. Neoclassical Theory of Capital Demand

      This section derives causal e¤ects of government policies based on the neoclassical q-theory of
capital demand for a …rm facing taxation and regulation. We follow the tractable model of Abel
and Eberly (1997).

2.1. Technology

      Time is continuous and horizons are in…nite. Agents are risk-neutral and discount cash payments
at a constant rate r > 0: The price-taking …rm sells an output ‡ow each instant at a positive
stochastic price ( t )t     0.   The production function is       t nt   s1t   ; with the factor share 0 <      < 1:
The productivity process ( t )t         0   is positive and stochastic. The production input s represents
physical capital which can be adjusted at a cost. Capital depreciates at a constant rate                      0. The
production input n is costlessly adjustable and has a constant unit price p > 0.
      Government intervention in the economy takes two forms. First, the government imposes a
linear tax at rate          0 on gross operating pro…ts.1 Second, government intervention in the input
market determines p. For example, minimum wage laws a¤ect labor input costs. Environmental
laws a¤ect fuel input prices. Tari¤s and state-level taxes are often imposed on production inputs.
To …x ideas, throughout we consider an econometrician interested in estimating the causal e¤ects
of these forms of commonly-studied government interventions.

      Other tax bases, e.g. income tax with interest deductions, can be modeled but with considerable added complexity
such as the need to model leverage policy. See Hennessy, Kasahara and Strebulaev (2015).

homogeneous we consider Markov control policies of the form at = a(xt ): Capital can be purchased

stant. Given our objective is to provide insight into the empirical literature, the posited investment
cost function is useful in that, as shown below, it maps to the linear causal e¤ect model common
in empirical work. A general class of investment cost functions will be considered as an extension
in Section 6.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the control problem is:

                                                                               1     2 2

We conjecture a classical solution to the HJB equation, with V being C 1 .2
       The optimal instantaneous control policy solves:

                                           max              aVs (s; x)          a         a2 :                            (11)

                                                                     8
We conjecture and then verify the value function is of the form

                                       V (s; x) = sq(x) + G(x)                                                   (12)

where q and G are posited to be C 1 : The term sq(x) measures the value of the accumulated capital
stock while G measures growth option value.
   Under the conjectured value function, Vs (s; x) = q(x) and the optimal accumulation policy is:

                                                      q(x)
                                         a(x) =                      :                                           (13)
                                                         2

   The instantaneous net gain attributable to accumulation is:

                                  aq       a        a2 = (q                  )2                                  (14)
                                                          1
                                                            :
                                                         4

   Substituting into the Bellman equation the conjectured value function, and the instantaneous
gain under optimal accumulation from equation (14), we obtain:

                                                                              1   2 2            1   2 2

   Since the Bellman equation must hold point-wise on the state space, the terms scaled by s
in the preceding equation must equate. This implies the following ordinary di¤erential equation
describing the evolution of the shadow value of capital:

                                                             1   2 2
                           (r + )q(x) = xqx (x) +                    x qxx (x) + x:                              (16)
                                                             2

From the preceding equation and the Feynman-Kac formula it follows:
                                        Z 1
                             q(x0 ) = E     e (r+ )t xt dt j F0 :                                                (17)
                                               0

That is, q is the discounted value of the marginal product of capital.
   As in Abel and Eberly (1997), we can rule out bubbles causing unbounded valuations as x goes
to zero or in…nity. We obtain the following solution to equation (16):

                                                                 x
                                       q (x; ) =                         :                                       (18)
                                                          r+

                                                      9
The optimal accumulation policy is:

                                                  1         x
                                   a (x; ) =                              :                        (19)
                                                 2     r+

Note, in the preceding two equations, and throughout the remainder of the paper, double-stars are
used to denote variables obtained under the present section’s neoclassical theory of investment.
   Heckman (2000) writes, “Comparative statics exercises formalize Marshall’s notion of a ceteris
paribus change, which is what economists mean by a causal e¤ect.” In the posited neoclassical
theory of capital accumulation, we have the following causal e¤ect:

                                      @                 x
                                        a (x; ) =                     :                            (20)
                                     @            2 (r +          )

Note, the causal e¤ect is linear in the government policy variable .
   A complete model solution requires computing the growth option value function (G). However,
since our objective is to analyze causal e¤ects, the policy function (19) is su¢ cient. The growth
option value is presented in the appendix.

3. The Econometric Setting

   One would like to determine the conditions under which natural experiments correctly recover
the magnitude and/or sign of causal e¤ects. The remainder of the paper treats the model itself
as a laboratory. The laboratory is ideal in two respects. First, in contrast to the real-world
environment confronting empiricists, we here know the theory-implied causal e¤ects, as shown in
equation (20). Second, we consider an econometrician inhabiting an economy where government
policy evolves as an independent stochastic process. This independence assumption allows us to
abstract from endogeneity bias– the primary focus of contemporary empirical work. We consider
an econometrician who uses measured treatment responses in attempting to infer causal e¤ects.

3.1. The Policy Generating Process

   The econometrician measures …rm responses to exogenous changes in the government policy
process ( t )t   0.   This process evolves as an N -state continuous-time Markov chain de…ned on
( ; F; M) which is independent of (xt )t   0:   The instantaneous capital accumulation control (at )t   0

is right-continuous, Markovian, and progressively measurable with respect to (Ftx; )t      0.



                                                      10
     To conserve notation we omit time subscripts where obvious. With this in mind, let government
policy in regime i be denoted           i,   with i = 1; :::; N , and N                   2. The indexing convention is:


                                                         1   > ::: >          N    > 0:

     If the current regime is i, the amount of time policy will remain in regime i before transitioning
is denoted Ti . The random variable Ti is exponentially distributed with parameter                                    i:   It follows
                                                                                                              1
that, when in regime i, the expected remaining duration of regime i is                                    i       :
     The conditional probability of transitioning into state j, given a transition out of i, is denoted
Pij . The parameter      ij   0 denotes the transition rate from regime i to regime j, and is de…ned as
follows:

                                                              ij           i Pij :


From the preceding equation it follows that:
                                                                      X
                                                              i   =               ij :
                                                                      j6=i

If   i   = 0; then state i is absorbing. If          i   tends to 1; then state i is an instantaneous state, using
the terminology of Ross (1996).

3.2. Model Solution

     We turn next to a characterization of optimal accumulation. The performance functional is:
                                                Z    1
                                                             rt
                              J(a) = E                   e         t xt s t          at   a2t dt j F0 :                         (21)
                                                 0

The value of the …rm in policy state i is denoted V i : Accounting for regime changes, and concomitant
capital gains, we have the following system of N Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations:

                                                                         1 2 2 1

                                                                      11
   The optimal state-contingent accumulation policy solves:

                        ai (x) 2 arg max           aVsi (s; x)          a     a2 ; i = 1; :::; N:         (23)
                                          a


We conjecture the solution to the Bellman system (22) has the following functional form

                    V 1 (s; x) = q 1 (x)s + G1 (x); :::; V N (s; x) = q N (x)s + GN (x):                  (24)

where each q i and Gi is posited to be C 1 . Under the value function conjectured in equation (24),
Vsi (s; x) = q i (x) and the optimal state-contingent accumulation policy is:

                                                   q i (x)
                                        ai (x) =                    ; i = 1; :::; N:                      (25)
                                                         2

From equation (25) it follows accumulation will exhibit a jump each time there is a policy regime
transition. Each jump represents a treatment response measured by the econometrician.
   Evaluated at the optimal policy, the instantaneous net gain attributable to accumulation is:

                          ai (x)q i (x)          ai (x)          [ai (x)]2 = [q i (x)    ]2 :             (26)

   Substituting the accumulation gain from equation (26) and the conjectured value functions into
the original system of Bellman equations, we can rewrite the Bellman system as:
                          0                1          0            1

The second expression for the shadow value o¤ered above follows from the …rst via integration by
parts. It states that the shadow value is the expectation over the current policy regime life, which
is exponentially distributed, of the net marginal product of capital up to the regime change plus
the expectation of the shadow value of capital after the regime change.
    We conjecture the following solution to system (28):

                                                         q i (x) = xci ; i = 1; :::; N:                                                                   (30)

Substituting the conjectured linear solutions into the system of equations (28), it follows that the
shadow value of capital is:             2                 3                                        2       3

We know from the Lévy-Desplanques Theorem (Horn and Johnson (1985)) that a Strictly Diagonal
Dominant matrix is non-singular. In the present context it follows that there is a unique solution
c to equation (31) since:
                                            R > 0 ) jT(R)j 6= 0:                                    (33)

      If there are only two possible policy states, the preceding shadow value expression can be written
as:
                                       i                         ij ( j   i)
                      q i (x) =              +                                                 x:   (34)
                                  r+               (r +        )(r +      +    ij   +   ji )

      To complete the model solution, we must also compute the state-contingent growth option
value (Gi ). However, since our objective is to analyze the relationship between measured treatment
responses and causal e¤ects, the policy function in equation (25) and the shadow value vector (31)
are su¢ cient. Derivation of the growth option value is provided in the appendix.

4. Treatment Responses and Causal E¤ects

      This section analyzes the relationship between measured treatment responses and causal e¤ects.
From equation (25) it follows that the optimal accumulation policy is

      Consider now the treatment responses that will be observed by the econometrician. The treat-
ment response associated with a transition from state i to j is denoted T Rij : We have:

                                       T Rij (x)      aj (x) ai (x)                                 (36)

                                                      2

Transitions across policy states result in jumps in accumulation proportional to the jumps in the
shadow value.
      Recall, causal e¤ects were shown to be linear (equation (20)). Therefore, the causal e¤ect
associated with a discrete change in the policy variable is here correctly computed by multiplying

4.1. Attenuation Bias

         This subsection considers the problem of attenuation bias. We …rst consider the simplest possible
setting, one in which the policy variable can only take on two possible values. The following
proposition follows directly from the formula for the shadow value under binary assignment given
in equation (34), with treatment responses equal to               q=2 :

Proposition 1 If there are only two possible policy states, the treatment response is
                            0                           1
                                    B                 +              C 1                x( j
                                    B            ij        ji        C                               i)
                        T Rij (x) = B1                               C                                     :
                                    @    r+           +    ij   + ji A 2                r+
                                         |            {z           } |                   {z               }
                                               Attenuation                              CEij


         With binary assignment there is always attenuation bias. Further, the bias is quite severe even
in settings with long expected policy regime durations. To illustrate, suppose the econometrician
inhabits an economy with long expected policy durations, say 10 years (                               ij   =   ji   = :10). In
this case, attenuation bias exceeds one-half of causal e¤ects under reasonable parameterizations
featuring r +             < :20. Similarly, the proposition shows that the size of the attenuation bias
exceeds one-half under such parameterizations if one considers, say, a permanent transition (                           ji   = 0)
out of a policy regime with an expected duration of 5 years (                  ij   = :20) or an unexpected transition
(   ij    in…nitesimal) to a new regime with an expected 5 year duration (                     ji   = :20). For example, in
reviewing the extensive empirical analysis of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Slemrod (1990) points to
surprisingly small estimated tax-elasticities. Our calculations suggest that small responses to the
legislation might well have been expected.



                                                           15
     Two other implications of Proposition 1 are worth noting. First, it is apparent that if either
regime is instantaneous, the treatment response will be in…nitesimal and the attenuation bias is
nearly 100% of the causal e¤ect. Conversely, if both transition rates are in…nitesimal, treatment
responses approximate causal e¤ects.
     Consider next a setting in which all transition rates are equal, with     ij   =     > 0 for all i 6= j: In
this case, each policy regime has an expected life equal to 1=(N       1) : Here, if a transition out of an
arbitrary state i occurs, the conditional probability of transitioning to each of the remaining states
is uniform, with Pij = 1=(N      1): As shown in the appendix, the following proposition follows from
equation (31) and the fact that       a=    q=2 :

Proposition 2 If all transition rates are equal to        > 0, with N policy states the treatment response
is                                0                         1
                                   B            N     C 1              x( j     i)
                       T Rij (x) = B
                                   @1
                                                      C                               :
                                           r+      +N A 2              r+
                                           |    {z   } |                {z           }
                                            Attenuation                CEij


     The preceding proposition implies that if all transition rates are equal, there is attenuation bias.
Here too, the attenuation bias is quite severe even if one considers settings with long expected policy
durations. For example, suppose the e¤ective discount rate is 5% and that the expected regime life
is ten years, with N = 11 and       = :01: The attenuation bias is equal to 69% of the causal e¤ect.
Consider instead an expected regime life of twenty years, with N = 11 and                 = :005: Although it
would be tempting to treat such a long regime as equivalent to permanent, the attenuation bias
here amounts to 52% of the causal e¤ect.

4.2. Overshooting and Sign Reversals

     The settings described in the previous subsection featuring binary assignment or equality of all
transition rates are comforting inasmuch as an empiricist can claim treatment responses measured
in such environments are conservative estimates of causal e¤ects. Of course, it is not clear why one
would want conservative estimates. After all, conservative estimates of elasticities lead to downward
bias in the estimated deadweight loss arising from government interventions. Further, magnitudes,
as distinct from signs, are often used as the basis for falsifying underlying theories. Finally, the
settings analyzed in the previous subsection might be viewed as atypical. After all, it is seldom the


                                                    16
case that a policy variable is binary, and it is seldom the case that policy transitions are uniformly
distributed.
   These arguments notwithstanding, one might hope that the settings considered in the preceding
subsection are still instructive regarding the nature of the wedge between treatment responses and
causal e¤ects. After all, conventional wisdom holds that …rms will invest less aggressively in response
to transient government policies, so that attenuation bias may be expected to be a general feature.
The following proposition demonstrates this is not the case.

Proposition 3 If there are more than two policy states, there exists a continuum of transition
rates such that a proper subset of treatment responses are opposite in sign to their respective causal
e¤ ects, as well as a continuum of transition rates such that a proper subset of treatment responses
are equal in sign but larger in absolute value than their respective causal e¤ ects.

   We defer for now discussion of the intuition behind the preceding proposition, since it is most
readily understood in the context of experiments featuring permanent assignment, the subject of
the next subsection.

4.3. Transitions to Absorbing States

   In light of Proposition 3, empiricists might be interested in better understanding the nature of
the bias they face, as well as the probabilities of each bias form. This subsection provides a practical
guide for random assignment experiments in settings such that each of the states to which the policy
variable may possibly transition (“transition-to states”) are absorbing. That is, we characterize
bias when the upcoming random assignment is permanent.
   To begin, when transition-to states are absorbing, there is a simple relationship between treat-
ment responses and causal e¤ects, with:
                                 1                                  1        ix
               T Rij = CEij +      q (x;   i)   q i (x) = CEij +                   q i (x) :       (38)
                                2                                  2    r+
   If the current regime i has the feature that all potential transition-to regimes are absorbing, the
Bellman equation is:
                                                                        1 2 2 i
                 rV i (s; x) = max (a      s)Vsi (s; x) + xVxi (s; x) +     x Vxx (s; x)           (39)
                                a                                       2
                                 X
                                         j
                               +    ij [V (s; x)     V i (s; x)] + i xs   a    a2 :
                                  j6=i


                                                   17
In the preceding equation, the absorbing transition-to state value functions (V j ) can be obtained
from the constant policy model of Section 2. Solving the preceding equation for the shadow value
we obtain:

                                                                   x                          X
               q i (x) = q (x;          i)   +                                                        Pij (   j   i)   (40)
                                                 (r +        )[1 + (r +            )E(Ti )]
                                                                                               j6=i
                                1
               E(Ti ) =     i       :

   Substituting equation (40) into equation (38) and rearranging terms, we obtain the following
proposition.

Proposition 4 Consider initial state i such that each potential transition-to state j is absorbing.
If the realized transition-to state is k, the ratio of treatment response to causal e¤ ect is:

                                                                           Expected Treatment

                                =1                                                                      :

                                                                                   | k {z }i

   It follows from the proposition that if each possible transition-to state is absorbing and the
conditional expectation of the policy variable change is zero, then every treatment response is
equal to its respective causal e¤ect. If instead the conditional expectation of the policy variable
change is not zero, every treatment response is biased. The ratio of measured treatment response to
causal e¤ect approaches one for realized policy variable changes large in absolute value. Conversely,
the ratio of treatment response to causal e¤ect becomes unboundedly large in absolute value for
in…nitesimal realized changes. Thus, the proposition reveals that treatment responses derived from
small policy variable changes are especially unreliable as guides to causal e¤ects. Notice this is true
absent any notion of rational or irrational response inertia (e.g. Chetty (2012)).
   From Proposition 4 we have the following corollary delineating bias regions.

Corollary If each possible transition-to state is absorbing and the conditional expectation of the
change in the policy variable is not zero, the sign and magnitude of the treatment response bias
depends on the realized assignment category k. If the conditional expectation of the change in                           is

   The intuition for the corollary is as follows. Consider a setting in which the conditional expec-
tation of the change in   is positive. If the realized treatment is negative (         k   <   i ),   the treatment
response will have the correct negative sign but will overshoot the causal e¤ect in absolute value
terms. Objectively bad news becomes very bad news if arriving news was expected to be positive.
If instead the realized treatment features a large increase in , the treatment response will have
the correct positive sign but be biased downwards. After all, if the conditional expectation of the
change in   is positive, …rms already invest at a higher rate prior to treatment. Finally, if the real-
ized treatment entails a su¢ ciently small increase in , the treatment response will actually have
the wrong sign. Objectively good news becomes bad news if even better news had been expected.
   The corollary allows one to readily compute the probability of the various biases, attenuation,
overshooting, and sign reversals, depending on the distribution of the treatments, expected regime
life, and discount rates. One simply needs to compute the probability of the treatment random
variable falling into the respective bias regions. In general, the results are not comforting. To
illustrate, consider an economy in which r +                  = :05, with an expected current regime life of

                                                         19
…ve years, and a future permanent change in      being drawn from a granular set of points uniformly
distributed on [0,1]. From the proposition it follows that the treatment response is negative for
realized changes less than 0.5/[1+.05(5)]=0.40. That is, evaluated ex ante, the probability of the
realized treatment response having the wrong sign is 40%. If the e¤ective discount rate is increased
from 5% to 10%, or the expected regime life increases from 5 to 10 years, the sign reversal probability
is equal to 33%.
   Figure 1 o¤ers a quantitative example illustrating the bias regions for the case of absorbing
transition-to states. The example assumes: the change in           is uniformly distributed on [-0.20,
0.80]; the expected regime life is …ve years; and r +            = :10: The …gure plots the ratio of
treatment response to causal e¤ects for all possible realized policy treatments. The …gure shows
treatment responses overshoot causal e¤ects for realized       < 0. Since the expected change in      is
positive (0.30) bad news becomes very bad news. Treatment responses overshoot causal e¤ects by
a very wide margin in the case of small negative treatments. There is also a region where treatment
responses are opposite in sign to causal e¤ects. In particular, …rms cut investment in reaction to
increases in     on the interval (0, 0.20). The percentage downward bias is extremely large for small
increases in :
   The preceding examples illustrate that sign reversals and overshooting are not anomalies requir-
ing pathological policy generating processes. Rather, one can readily compute bias probabilities
depending on the statistical properties of the randomized treatment under consideration. In the
preceding example, the probability of the experiment yielding an incorrect sign was 20%, while the
probability of overshooting was also 20%. The remaining 60% of potential experimental treatments
would result in treatment responses attenuated relative to causal e¤ects.
   Taken together, the results of this subsection imply that for a natural experiment involving
permanent random assignment, the ideal experiment features a mean zero policy variable change.
However, if the policy variable change is not mean zero, there is inevitably a bias. Nevertheless, as
shown, there is an analytical argument for seeking out experiments in which the realized change in
the policy variable is large. Further, if the empiricist is pursuing the more limited goal of estimating
a causal e¤ect sign, realized policy changes opposite in sign to expected changes are sign-robust,
as are experiments in which the realized treatment has the expected sign but exceeds in absolute
value the expected treatment.

4.4. Bias Bounds

   This subsection demonstrates some inherent limitations on the nature and severity of biases
that can arise in natural policy experiments. Consider …rst the problem of attenuation bias. A
natural question to ask is whether there exists any policy generating process such that all treatment
responses are equal to zero. The answer is no, as shown in the following lemma.

Lemma 1 There is no set of policy transition rates such that all treatment responses are equal to
zero.

   Of course, the preceding lemma provides only a modicum of comfort in relation to the problem
of attenuation bias since it still allows for the possibility of severe attenuation. For example, it
follows from Propositions 1 and 2 that treatment responses tend to zero when each of the regimes
becomes highly transient (all   ij   tending to in…nity).
   Consider next the problem of treatment responses overshooting causal e¤ects. The following
lemma shows that regardless of the assumed transition rates, overshooting cannot possibly occur
in the case of worst-to-best state transitions.

Lemma 2 The treatment response associated with a transition from the worst state (N ) to the best
state (1) cannot overshoot its causal e¤ ect.

   To motivate the next lemma, suppose for there are three policy states with low, medium and
high values of , with the low and high states being absorbing. If the shadow value of capital in
the medium state is less than its value under permanent assignment, there will be overshooting in
the event of a transition to the high state, but undershooting in the event of a transition to the low
state. That is, overshooting for one transition implies undershooting for another transition. The
following lemma reveals this to be a more general phenomenon.

Lemma 3 If there exists a transition from state j to a (better) state i < j with treatment response
exceeding its respective causal e¤ ect by k > 0, then the treatment response for the transition from
the worst state (N ) to j plus the treatment response for the transition from state i to the best state
(1) must fall below the sum of their respective causal e¤ ects by at least k:



                                                   21
   Consider …nally the problem of sign reversals. The following lemma shows sign reversals cannot
be universal.

Lemma 4 There is at least one state such that the treatment response associated with a transition
from it to the best state (1) is positive, and there is at least one state such that the treatment
response associated with a transition to it from the worst state (N ) is positive.


5. Bias Corrections

   This section analyzes how to infer causal e¤ects based upon measured treatment responses.
To …x ideas, suppose the econometrician has a panel dataset featuring investment responses to a
transition from   i   to   j:   Based upon this evidence, she would like to infer the cross-section of causal
e¤ects.
   As shown below, the causal e¤ect for …rm m is determined by the policy-invariant structural
parameter   m    which is assumed to be unobserved. The inference problem confronting the econo-
metrician can be viewed as an application of the heterogeneous treatment e¤ects model commonly
used in the …elds of medicine, education and labor. In particular, the treatment response of …rm
m is equal to:

                                                     m
                                                  T Rij = (qj qi )     m                                     (41)
                                                            1
                                                     m        :
                                                          2 m

   Heterogeneous e¤ects is a situation that commonly confronts empiricists. Under dynamic ran-
dom assignment there is an additional source of complexity relative to static experiments since the
treatment size is not directly observable. Rather, the treatment,                   q, must be determined via the
policy transition matrix and equation (31).
   Using equation (31) to compute the relevant state-contingent shadow values, it follows from
equation (41) that:
                                              m
                                           T Rij        m
                                                     T Rij                 1 (cj ci )x
                                  m   =          =           )     m   =         m     :                     (42)
                                          qj qi    (cj ci )x               2 T Rij
   Therefore, the causal e¤ect implied by an observed treatment response is:

              m
                                                  qj    qi      m      (   j   i )=(r    +    )      m
            CEij = [qj            qi ]    m   =              T Rij =                              T Rij      (43)
                                                   qj   qi                     cj       ci

                                                             22
with cj   ci determined by equation (31). E¤ectively, recovery of causal e¤ects here demands a re-
scaling of the observed treatment response to account for the shadow value wedge under permanent
versus transient government policies.
   Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard (1994) use …rm responses to imputed changes in the shadow
value of capital to infer adjustment cost parameters. Their imputation assumes each tax code
change is unanticipated and expected to be permanent. They argue this assumption overstates the
true change in the shadow value of capital and overstates adjustment costs. However, the analysis
of Section 4 shows that their imputation method may overstate, understate, or have sign that is
opposite to the true change in shadow values. It follows from equation (42) that their inferred
adjustment costs can be overstated, understated, or have the wrong sign.
   Finally, it is worth noting that in the interest of brevity this section has con…ned attention
to bias correction for the case of linear treatment e¤ects, which arise under the posited smooth
linear-quadratic investment cost function. More generally, with correctly imputed shadow values
derived from equation (31), one can use observed treatment responses to recover policy-invariant
parameters for alternative investment cost functions. In turn, the adjustment cost parameters can
then be used to compute implied causal e¤ects.

6. Identifying Assumptions

   Section 4 demonstrates random assignment is not generally su¢ cient for equality of treatment
responses and causal e¤ects in dynamic settings. The objective of this section is to provide empiri-
cists with a set of identifying assumptions ensuring treatment responses are unbiased estimators of
causal e¤ects. Conditions for sign identi…cation are also derived.
   In order to broaden the range of circumstances under which the identifying assumptions can
be utilized, it will be useful to consider a general investment cost technology. The literature
on capital accumulation has considered realistic real frictions creating lumpy investment and/or
inaction regions. For example, Abel and Eberly (1994) consider that there can be …xed costs to
nonzero investment, and that the …rm may not be able to sell its installed capital for the same price
at which it was originally purchased. Chetty (2012) has argued that such frictions and associated
inaction regions can cloud the interpretation of empirical evidence. To account for these empirical
concerns, we consider the following General Investment Cost Function.



                                                 23
                                                                                                 +
De…nition 1 General Investment Cost Function: The …rm can buy capital at price                       and sell
                         +
capital at price             . Adjustment costs are ; where       is a strictly convex twice di¤ erentiable
function of accumulation attaining a minimum value of zero at a = 0: The …xed cost to non-zero
investment is '    0:

   Two points are worth noting at this stage. First, since the General Investment Cost Func-
tion shares with the initially-posited investment cost function ( a + a2 ) the property of being
invariant to s; it follows that the shadow value formulae derived in the preceding sections remain
valid. Second, Abel and Eberly (1994) show that under the General Adjustment Cost Function,
instantaneous investment is weakly monotone increasing in q. If ' = 0, optimal accumulation is
                                                           +
continuous in q; with a = 0 optimal for all q 2 [      ;       ]: If ' > 0, optimal accumulation is zero
over a wider interval of q values, and exhibits a discontinuity at optimal thresholds for switching
from inaction to action.
   With these points in mind, we begin by deriving a restriction on transition rates such that
the treatment responses converge to causal e¤ects absent …xed costs (' = 0). To begin, note
that in performing comparative statics, e.g. equation (20), it is as if agents expect the initial
policy to be permanent, with nature perturbing the policy variable and agents then expecting
the new policy to be permanent. One might thus expect treatment responses to approximate
causal e¤ects if the policy generating process features “almost completely unanticipated” policy
changes that are “nearly-permanent.” Indeed, it follows from equation (31) that as all transition
rates tend to zero, all state-contingent shadow values (q i (x)) under transient policies approach
their value under permanent assignment to their respective states (q (x;          i )).   Such shadow value
convergence is su¢ cient for treatment responses to approximate causal e¤ects absent discontinuity
in the investment policy function arising from …xed costs. We have the following proposition.

Proposition 5 In the limit as all transition rates tend to zero, each treatment response converges
to its respective causal e¤ ect if …xed costs of investment are equal to zero.

   Given the limited availability of rare-event natural experiments, and the potential for …xed costs
to cloud inference, it would be useful to derive alternative identifying assumptions. Conveniently,
we have the following result.


                                                  24
Proposition 6 Necessary and su¢ cient conditions for treatment responses to equal causal e¤ ects
for each policy transition are that the best state (1) and worst state (N ) are absorbing, with remain-
ing states being absorbing or featuring mean-zero policy variable changes.

      To provide intuition for the preceding proposition it is convenient to express the shadow value
as the discounted marginal product of capital. Given the econometrician’s assumption that                         t   and
xt are independent stochastic processes, the shadow value (equation (29)) can be rewritten as:
                                          Z 1
                              q i (x0 ) =     fE0 [ t ]E0 [xt ]ge (r+ )t dt:                 (44)
                                                     0

      Under the conditions described in Proposition 6, E0 [ t ] =             i   which implies q i (x0 ) = q (x0 ;    i ):

That is, the shadow value capitalizes the current government policy state as if lasting forever.
And this holds the instant before and the instant after each policy variable change. Thus, at each
instant the …rm acts as if the current policy state will last forever despite knowing it will not. In
such benign environments the econometrician can directly extract causal e¤ects from treatment
responses even if …rms face highly transient policies. From this result it follows that reliance on
rare-events is overly-restrictive.
      In some cases, an empiricist may be interested in the more limited objective of avoiding an
incorrect sign estimate. A description of identifying assumptions ensuring against sign reversals is
therefore worthwhile. Since investment is weakly monotone increasing in q; a su¢ cient condition
for the absence of sign reversals is q j             q i for all j < i: It is readily veri…ed that this condition is
satis…ed under binary assignment (Proposition 1) or if all transitions rates are equal (Proposition
2).
      In order to derive another sign identi…cation condition, return attention to equation (44). Since
the current instantaneous marginal product of capital is strictly decreasing in the current state index
j, it follows that q j is strictly decreasing in j if the policy state is stochastically monotone. Letting
the superscript j index the initial state, we recall from Kolokoltsov (2011) the continuous-time
                                             j
Markov chain for the policy state            t   is said to be stochastically monotone if:

                      j                j+1
                Pr[   t   k]     Pr[   t         k] 8 k 2 f1; :::; N g; j 2 f1; :::; N     1g; t 2 R+ :               (45)

                                                                                                       j
That is, if the policy state is stochastically monotone, then at all future dates t,                   t   is …rst-order
                               j+1
stochastic dominant to         t   .

                                                             25
   Keilson and Kester (1977) derive necessary and su¢ cient conditions for stochastic monotonicity
(Theorem 2.1). Applying their theorem, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 5 No treatment response has sign opposite to its respective causal e¤ ect if the following

   Stochastic monotonicity thus represents another possible identifying assumption for the more
limited goal of sign identi…cation. A number of commonly-utilized processes are stochastically
monotone, such as random walks with absorbing or impenetrable boundaries, as shown by Keilson
and Kester (1977).
   The following proposition summarizes the conditions derived for sign identi…cation.

Proposition 7 No treatment response has sign opposite its respective causal e¤ ect if the policy
variable is binary; transitions are uniformly distributed with             ij    =    for all i and j; or the policy
variable is stochastically monotone.


7. The Lucas Critique: Application, Extension and Correction

   Up to this point attention has been con…ned to determining the relationship between measured
treatment responses and causal e¤ects. This section considers a related but distinct question:
whether and how some historic treatment response in a given economy can be used to forecast
future treatment responses in that same economy or in di¤erent economies.

7.1. Limits to External and Internal Validity

   An observation following directly from the model is that it is not generally valid to use the
treatment response in one economy to forecast the treatment response in another economy. This
argument holds even if the change in the policy variable is the same and the economies have identical
production and investment technologies. To see this, note that it follows from equation (31) that
if economies A and B have di¤erent policy transition rates, then TA 6= TB , implying di¤erences in

                                                           26
shadow values and treatment responses. In other words, as argued by Lucas (1976), if the policy
generating process is changed (here represented by T), decision rules (here the T Rij ) will change.
This is an important limitation on the external validity.
   In fact, the Lucas Critique is just one limit on extrapolation. The model also illustrates im-
portant limits to the internal validity of measured treatment responses arising from natural exper-
iments. Speci…cally, even if one considers a single economy and holds …xed the policy transition
matrix T, so that the Lucas Critique does not apply, it is generally not valid to directly use a
historic treatment response to forecast future treatment responses.
   To illustrate limits to internal validity, we consider three numerical examples. Each example
approximates a di¤erent policy environment. All three examples consider variation in the                policy
variable across ten states, with jumps across neighboring states of equal size. Each example assumes
that only nearest-neighbor transitions are possible. The e¤ective discount rate is set to 10%.
   In the …rst example it is assumed that the transition rate for an up move is               u   = :15 and
the transition rate for a down move is         d   = :05: The implied expected regime duration is …ve
years. The results are shown in Table 1. As shown, the fact that          u   >   d   results in asymmetric
treatment responses. Since an up move is more likely than a down move, shadow values are pushed
upward, implying relatively large (small) treatment responses for downward (upward) transitions.
For example, starting at         = 1:9 the treatment response for an up move is .449, while that for a
down move is -.697, a 55% di¤erence. In addition, treatment responses vary across initial states,
despite the fact that the transition rates for each state are identical and causal e¤ects are linear.
For example, the minimum treatment response is .449 and the maximum treatment response is
.978, a di¤erence of 118%.
   Consider next Table 2. This example again assumes jumps in           across neighboring states are of
equal size and that only nearest-neighbor transitions are possible. In contrast to the …rst example,
we now assume that for states 1 through 5, there is a bias toward further increases in       with   u   = :15
and    d   = :05: Conversely, if the initial state is 6-10, there is a bias toward further decreases in
with   u   = :05 and    d   = :15: One can think of this example as approximating a polarized political
system. As in the prior example, the expected policy regime duration is 5 years. As shown in the
table, here one sees even larger di¤erences between treatment responses across states. For example,
the minimum treatment response is .451 and the maximum treatment response is 2.208, a striking

                                                      27
di¤erence of 390%. Further, under this policy generating process the highest treatment responses
involve transitions between the interim states 5 and 6.
   Consider …nally Table 3. As in the preceding two examples, jumps in                 across neighboring states
are of equal size and only nearest-neighbor transitions are possible. However, it is now assumed
that for states 1 through 5 there is a bias toward further decreases in             with   d   = :15 and   u   = :05:
Conversely, for states 6 through 10, there is a bias toward further increases in                   with    d   = :05
and   u   = :15: One can think of this example as approximating a political system with a tendency
toward centrism. As in the prior two examples, the expected policy regime duration is 5 years. As
shown in the table, here again one sees large di¤erences in treatment responses across the states. In
contrast to the preceding example, the lowest treatment response is for transitions between states
5 and 6, with the highest treatment responses near the two boundaries.

7.2. Overcoming Limits to External and Internal Validity

   A natural question to ask is how the limits to internal and external validity detailed in the
previous subsection can be overcome. For simplicity, assume all …rms are driven by a common
geometric Brownian motion x and employ potentially-heterogeneous linear-quadratic investment
cost functions    a+         2:
                        ma        A similar inversion procedure would apply for alternative adjustment
cost functions.
   Consider the problem of internal validity. To …x ideas, suppose the empiricist has measured
a historic treatment response associated with                  jumping from state i to state j. She is now
interested in using this historical evidence, speci…cally the sample average treatment response
                               d
T Rij , to generate a forecast T R regarding how …rms in this same economy will respond to a
future transition from say        h   to   k:   From equation (42) we have:

                    d                                  T Rij                   ck   ch
                    T Rhk = b (qk           qh ) =              (qk   qh ) =           T Rij :                  (46)

Extrapolation can be understood as a two-step process. In the …rst step, one computes the accu-
mulation response per unit of shadow value b by normalizing the historical treatment response by
the change in shadow value at that transition date. This is then re-scaled by the change in shadow
value associated with the future-date transition. The …nal term in square brackets, the ratio of
shadow value changes, is computed via equation (31).


                                                          28
   Given its apparent brevity, it is worth emphasizing that the last term in squared brackets in
equation (46) generally depends upon all transition rates and all possible realizations of the policy
variable, not just those in the directly-relevant set fh; i; j; kg: However, in exceptional cases the
preceding formula simpli…es. For example, if the identifying assumptions described in Propositions
5 or 6 are satis…ed, we have:

                             ck         ch         k        h      d                    k       h
                                           =                      )T Rhk =                              T Rij :              (47)
                             cj         ci         j        i                           j       i

That is, if the underlying policy generating process meets the respective identifying assumptions for
equality of treatment responses and causal e¤ects, the extrapolation of treatment responses within
a policy generating process requires a straightforward adjustment for the relative size of changes
in the policy variable. Although imputations along the lines of formula (47) are commonplace, it
is apparent that such imputations are not generally valid.
   Consider next the problem of external validity (Lucas (1976)). Continuing with the preceding
example, suppose the econometrician would like to forecast how …rms in Economy B will respond
to a change in   from    B   to     B    based upon the evidence provided by the observed response of …rms
                         h          k

in Economy A to a change in              from          A   to     A.   Applying equation (31) we have:
                                                       i          j

                                                                                                                   T Rij :   (48)

That is, correct extrapolation across two economies requires taking explicit account of their respec-
tive policy generating processes via equation (31).

8. Numerical Example: Greenstone (2001)

   This section illustrates how one can extract causal e¤ects from observed treatment responses in
real-world dynamic settings. We consider the empirical environment analyzed by Greenstone (2001)
since this paper is rare in actually providing su¢ cient detail allowing one to estimate transition
rates. The primary emphasis here is not on speci…c numerical results but rather to outline the
basic method in a real-world setting. Since our model was not tailor-made for the policy setting
considered by Greenstone, some approximations are necessary. For example, we set our analysis
in continuous time in order to facilitate analytical solutions whereas the regulations Greenstone
considers might be better approximated using a discrete-time setup.


                                                                       29
      Greenstone (2001) considers the e¤ect of environmental regulations, exploiting quasi-random
regulatory assignment arising from the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under the CAA, counties are des-
ignated as achieving attainment or non-attainment status in four pollutant categories: Carbon
Monoxide, Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, and Total Suspended Particulates (TSP). Firms emitting the
relevant pollutant in non-attainment counties face surcharges and taxes. The Pulp, Paper, Iron
and Steel sectors emit all 4 pollutants, implying 16 possible combinations of attainment versus non-
attainment status over all pollutants. For brevity, we will con…ne our attention to these sectors.
      Table 4 provides detail on the possible regulation categories and assumed    values. The numeri-
cal examples assume each non-attainment infraction results in a reduction in . The baseline        for a
fully compliant …rm is normalized at 1. The following       reductions are assumed for non-attainment
for each pollutant: Carbon Monoxide=0.30; Ozone=0.25; Sulfur Dioxide=0.20; and TSP=0.10.
The lowest possible        value is 0.15 for a …rm emitting all four pollutants and residing in a county
that has non-attainment status for all four pollutants.
      The key input into the analysis are the transitions rates. Greenstone (2001) reports sum-
mary statistics allowing one to infer for each pollutant the conditional probability of starting a
given (…ve-year) observation period in Attainment/Non-Attainment status and ending the period
in Attainment/Non-Attainment status. Using the Kolmogorov forward equations, we calibrate the
continuous-time transition rates in order to match these conditional probabilities.3 Table 5 reports
transition rates across categories. The average regime life across the 16 possible categories is 1.4
periods or 7 years. We set r +           = 0:50 given that each observation period is …ve years.
      Table 6 reports the ratio of treatment response to causal e¤ect for the 240 possible regulation
category transitions for …rms in the Pulp, Paper, Iron and Steel sectors. As shown in the table,
the most common form of bias is attenuation. In many cases, the attenuation bias is substantial.
Further, there are 8 transitions (3%) for which treatment response is opposite in sign to the causal
e¤ect. And there are 24 transitions (10%) for which treatment response overshoots the causal e¤ect.
      Apparently, under the data generating process exploited by Greenstone (2001), sign reversals
are uncommon. This is because the most common and probable transition is to a neighboring
state. In contrast, we recall that sign reversals tend to occur when a large positive or negative
change is expected, while the realized change is equal in sign but relatively small in absolute value.

                                                    30
Thus, for those interested in understanding the causal e¤ect sign of environmental regulations,
the policy generating process exploited by Greenstone is attractive. However, for those wishing to
estimate deadweight losses of future environmental regulations, naïve substitution of his estimates
into standard deadweight formulae would generally result in a severe understatement of welfare
losses.
    Setting aside the particular application considered in this section, it is apparent that only by
way of opening up the black-box of the policy generating process, as done here, can one hope
to understand the sign and magnitude of biases arising in applied empirical exercises in dynamic
settings. This can be done by the empiricist or following Greenstone (2001) the empiricist can
provide enough detail on the underlying process such that others can perform independent back-
of-the-envelope bias estimates.

8. Concluding Remarks

    This paper analyzes the relationship between theory-implied causal e¤ects and measured treat-
ment responses in dynamic economies. We show that independent policy assignment is insu¢ cient
for valid inference. With binary assignment, or uniformly distributed transitions, treatment re-
sponses understate causal e¤ects, and substantially so under plausible parameterizations. With
more than two policy regimes, treatment responses can understate, overstate, or have a sign that is
opposite to causal e¤ects. Moreover, the probability of overshooting and sign reversals can be high
under plausible distributional assumptions. We also show important limits to the generalizabil-
ity of historic treatment responses. It is not valid, in general, to extrapolate treatment responses
within or across policy generating processes. Together, these results call into question the economic
meaning and utilization of a broad range of elasticity estimates shaping policy decisions.
    As constructive steps, we derive identifying assumptions required to ensure equality of treatment
responses and causal e¤ects in dynamic settings. We show that if all possible policy changes
are rare events, treatment responses approximate causal e¤ects absent …xed costs. However, we
o¤er a more widely applicable identifying condition, showing that even with …xed costs, treatment
responses equal causal e¤ects if the policy variable is a martingale. In the special case of permanent
assignment, each possible treatment response is equal to its respective causal e¤ect if, and only if,
the expected policy variable change has mean zero.


                                                 31
   In certain cases, empiricists are willing to settle for the more limited objective of avoiding
incorrect sign inference. We derive a battery of identifying assumptions that empiricists can invoke
to avoid incorrect signs: binary assignment; uniformly distributed policy transitions; permanent
assignment opposite in sign to the expected assignment; permanent assignment with the ratio of
treatment to expected treatment exceeding unity; or stochastic monotonicity of the policy variable.
As …nal constructive steps, we show how observed treatment responses can be mapped backed to
causal e¤ects, or extrapolated within or across policy generating processes.
   It follows from our analysis that an apparent falsi…cation of a given theory based on an incorrect
sign prediction may be a false falsi…cation. In particular, in addition to “the identifying assump-
tion” of random assignment, natural policy experiments must be understood as predicated upon
equally-important identifying assumptions about policy generating processes. Of course, this is a
special example of the arguments of Willard Van Orman Quine who pointed out that an empirical
falsi…cation only allows one to either reject the underlying theory or to reject an experimenter’s aux-
iliary assumptions. Unfortunately, these auxiliary assumptions have gone unrecognized, unstated
and unsatis…ed in much of the quasi-experimental literature.
   In the view of many, random assignment constitutes the ideal empirical setting for establishing
causality. Instead, we have shown that random assignment is properly seen as just one ingredient
in the making of an ideal policy experiment in dynamic economies.

value G is equal to the value of a claim to a dividend stream that is linear-quadratic in x. To value
this linear-quadratic claim, conjecture a linear-quadratic value function G with unknown constants

Taking di¤erences across rows, the transition response of the shadow value is:

                                                                N             1

And the result follows from        a=        q=2 :

                            = f1; 2; 3g. Transition rates from states outside f1; 2; 3g can be set
arbitrarily. It follows that the shadow value in any of these three states can be computed by
focusing on the system con…ned to f1; 2; 3g. Following our indexing convention, let                                                  3   <     2   <    1:

   To prove the …rst part of the proposition it is su¢ cient to …nd transition rates for the three state

   This implies:

                                          x
                       q 2 (x) =                  2                                                                                                    (58)

It follows that

Lemma 1

    The treatment response is zero across all regime changes if and only if the shadow value is
constant across regimes. This holds if and only if there is some constant k such that the shadow
value multipliers c = 1k. But this implies the existence of an augmented transition matrix T
satisfying:                                               2        3                         2        3

Lemma 2
    The result follows from:

                                                 q N (x)               q (x;     N)

                                                  q 1 (x)              q (x;     1)   :




Lemma 3
    From Lemma 2 it follows:

                                     q 1 (x)     q N (x)        q (x;      1)     q (x;           N ):                                  (63)

The preceding inequality may be rewritten as:

[q 1 (x)   q i (x)] + [q j (x)   q N (x)] + [q i (x)        q j (x)]        [q (x;           1)       q (x;      i )]   + [q (x;   j)   q (x;   N )]

                                                                            +[q (x;           i)         q (x;     j )]:                        (64)

                                                                   36
Rearranging terms, it follows:

        [q 1 (x)    q i (x)] + [q j (x)    q N (x)]          [q (x;         1)     q (x;       i )]   + [q (x;       j)      q (x;      N )]   (65)

                                                                  f[q i (x)      q j (x)]      [q (x;       i)      q (x;      j )]g:


Under the conditions stipulated in the lemma, the …nal term in fg brackets in the preceding equation
is equal to 2 k and so it follows:

 [q 1 (x)      q i (x)] + [q j (x)   q N (x)]      [q (x;         1)    q (x;      i )]   + [q (x;         j)     q (x;      N )]       2 k: (66)

The result follows by dividing the preceding equation by 2 :

Lemma 4
   For the …rst part of the lemma, consider a transition to state 1. Let q n (x0 ) be the minimum
shadow value amongst i > 1: And let
                  2    0                                                                                1                           3

                                                                                          Pij q j (xT )A ( e          T
                                                                                                                          )dT j F0 5 :         (67)
                             0       0                                            j6=i

Since     1   is maximal it follows that qb1 (x0 ; ) is decreasing in its second argument. Further:
                                                                                   X
                         q 1 (x0 )   qb1 (x0 ;    1)   > lim qb1 (x0 ; ) =                 Pij q j (xT )        q n (x0 ):
                                                          "1
                                                                                    j6=i

An analogous argument applies for a transition to state N .
Proposition 5
   Since T is Strictly Diagonal Dominant it is invertible. Moreover, each entry in the inverse is the
quotient of a polynomial and the determinant. Thus, …xing, say, the Euclidean norm, the inverse
function is continuous on the set of invertible matrices. It follows:

                                                             1                      1           1
                                          lim [T(R; )]            = [T(R; 0)]             =R        IN :
                                           #0

This implies q i (x) converges to               i x=R   implying that absent …xed investment costs each T Rij con-
verges to CEij :

Proposition 6
   Consider an array of distinct policies 1 to N with the indexing convention being that the shadow
value under permanent policies is decreasing in the index. A necessary and su¢ cient condition for

                                                                       37
each treatment response to equal its respective causal e¤ect is that the di¤erence between state-
contingent shadow values is equal to their respective di¤erence in shadow values under permanent
policies. Thus, there must exist some k such that for all i:

                                                                   ix
                                                q i (x) =                            + k:                                                        (68)
                                                            r+

Therefore, we must identify conditions such that the following equilibrium conditions can be met
under this functional form:

Substituting in the required functional form and canceling terms we obtain:

   First note that any solution to the preceding system entails k = 0 since the right-side of the
…rst equation is non-positive while the right-side of the last equation is non-negative. It follows
that any candidate solution to the system entails:

                                               1j    = 0 : j = 2; :::; N

Further, it must be the case that:
                                        X            ( j         i )x

                                        j6=i

The preceding equation can be rewritten as:
                                      !
                       X         ij
