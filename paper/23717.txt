                                          ABSTRACT

Using a compiled dataset of 441 censuses and surveys between 1787 and 2015, representing 103
countries and 48.4 million mothers, we find that: (1) the effect of fertility on labor supply is
typically indistinguishable from zero at low levels of development and large and negative at
higher levels of development; (2) the negative gradient is stable across historical and
contemporary data; and (3) the results are robust to identification strategies, model specification,
and data construction and scaling. Our results are consistent with changes in the sectoral and
occupational structure of female jobs and a standard labor-leisure model.

I.      Introduction
        The relationship between fertility and female labor supply is widely studied in
economics. For example, the link between family size and mothers’ work decisions has helped
explain household time allocation and the evolution of women’s labor supply, particularly
among rapidly growing countries in the second half of the 20th century (Carlinger, Robinson, and
Tomes 1980; Angrist and Evans 1998; Del Boca, Pasqua, and Pronzata 2005; Cristia 2008;
Bruijns 2014; and Hupkau and Leturcq 2016). Development economists relate the fertility-work
relationship to the demographic transition and study its implications on economic growth
(Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla 2001). Yet despite the centrality of these issues in the social
sciences, there is no unified evidence on whether this relationship has evolved over time and
with the process of economic development.
        Our contribution is to provide such evidence that spans not only a broad cross-section of
countries at various stages of development but historical examples from currently developed
countries dating back to the late 18th century. To provide consistent estimates over time and
space, we use two common instrumental variables strategies: (i) twin births introduced by
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1980) and applied repeatedly since (Bronars and Grogger 1994; Black,
Devereux, and Salvanes 2005; Caceres-Delpiano 2006; and Vere 2011) and (ii) the gender
composition of the first two children (Angrist and Evans 1998). We implement these estimators
using four large databases of censuses and surveys: the International Integrated Public Use Micro
Sample (IPUMS), the U.S. IPUMS, the North Atlantic Population Project, and the Demographic
and Health Surveys. Together, the data cover 441 country-years, and 48.4 million mothers,
stretching from 1787 to 2015 and, consequently, a large span of economic development.
        A natural starting point in thinking about the fertility-labor supply relationship is Angrist
and Evans (1998). Based on U.S. IPUMS data from 1980 and 1990, Angrist and Evans document
a negative effect of fertility on female labor supply using both gender mix and twin births as
instruments for subsequent children, a result also established by Bronars and Grogger (1994).2
Alternative instruments that rely on childless mothers undergoing infertility treatments in the
U.S. and Denmark (Cristia 2008 and Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen 2016) or natural
experiments like the introduction of birth control pills (Bailey 2013) or changes in abortion

2
  For discussions of the validity of various fertility instruments, see for example Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000),
Hoekstra et al. (2007), Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser (2010), and Bhalotra and Clarke (2016). Clarke (2016) provides
a useful summary of the empirical literature.

                                                        1
legislation (Bloom et al. 2009 and Angrist and Evans 1996) similarly conclude that children have
a negative effect on their mother’s labor supply or earnings. This instrument-invariant robustness
is particularly notable since each IV uses a somewhat different subpopulation of compliers to
estimate a local average treatment effect. That the results are consistent suggests wide external
validity (Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser 2010; Bisbee et al. 2017).
        However, we show that the negative relationship between fertility and mother’s work
behavior holds only for countries at a later stage of economic development. At a lower level of
income, including the U.S. and Western European countries prior to WWII, there is no causal
relationship between fertility and mothers’ labor supply. The lack of a negative impact at low
levels of development corresponds with Aguero and Marks’ (2008, 2011) studies of childless
mothers undergoing infertility treatments in 32 developing countries and Godefroy’s (2017)
analysis of changes to women’s legal rights in Nigeria.3 Strikingly, combining U.S historical
censuses with data from a broad set of contemporary developing countries, we find that the
negative gradient of the fertility-labor supply effect with respect to economic development is
remarkably consistent across time and space. That is, women in the U.S. at the turn of the 20th
century make the same labor supply decision in response to additional children as women in
developing countries today. Moreover, we show that the negative gradient is robust to a wide
range of data, sampling, and specification issues, including alternative instruments, development
benchmarks, initial family sizes beyond one child, sample specification criteria, conditioning
covariates including those highlighted by Bhalotra and Clarke (2016), additional measures of
mother’s labor supply, rescaling the estimates to account for varying secular rates of labor force
participation, and a variety of other adjustments to make our data historically consistent.
        Although we believe our results are exceedingly robust, they come with important
qualifications. First, by construction, the twins and same gender instruments cannot be applied to
the birth of first children. Indeed, the only papers that we are aware of that credibly identify the
effects of first children on mothers’ labor supply rely on the random success of in vitro
fertilization (IVF), which is not classified in any of our datasets. That said, the contrast between
Aguero and Marks’ (2008, 2011) finding of a zero effect in developing countries and Cristia’s
(2008) and Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen’s (2016) large negative effect in developed countries

3
 Another pertinent example is Heath (2017), who reports an economically small effect of fertility on women
working using non-experimental evidence from urban Ghana.


                                                        2
is tellingly consistent with the patterns in our data. Moreover, we show a similar pattern, albeit
with a monotonically declining magnitude consistent with many earlier studies (e.g. Bronars and
Grogger 1994, Angrist and Evans 1998, Cruces and Galiani 2007, Maurin and Moschion 2009,
Vere 2011, Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen 2016), across all family size parities beyond one
child, at least suggestive that the negative gradient is a general result. A second related
qualification is that, since our data are cross-sectional, we are only able to identify the short-run
effect of fertility. As noted in Adda, Dustman, and Stevens (2017), Lundborg, Plug, and
Rasmussen (2016), and Chaterjee and Vogl (2017), the life-cycle response is often attenuated
compared to the short-run effect, and late-in-life (rather than early) shocks are more likely to
have lasting impacts on fertility. Finally, our main results are primarily on labor force
participation rather than the intensive margin of hours worked; although we present the latter
results below, they are based on more limited data.
       The empirical regularities we describe are consistent with a standard labor-leisure model
augmented to include a taste for children. As wages increase during the process of development,
households face an increased time cost of fertility but also experience increased income. With a
standard constant elasticity of substitution utility function, the former effect dominates as
countries develop, creating a negative gradient.
       Indeed, in exploring the mechanism behind our result, we document that the income
effect from rising wages is likely invariant to economic development but the substitution effect
falls from zero to negative and is economically important as real GDP per capita increases. We
argue that the declining substitution effect arises from changes in the sectoral and occupational
structure of female jobs, as in Goldin (1995) and Schultz (1991). As economies evolve, women’s
labor market opportunities transition from agricultural and self-employment to urban wage work.
The latter tends to be less compatible with raising children and causes some movement out of the
labor force (Jaffe and Azumi 1960; McCabe and Rosenzweig 1976; Kupinsky 1977; Goldin
1995; Galor and Weil 1996; Edwards and Field-Hendrey 2002; and Szulga 2013). In support of
this channel, we show that the negative gradient is steeper among mothers with young children
that work in non-professional and non-agricultural wage-earning occupations (e.g., urban wage
work). Moreover, a growing literature documents a causal relationship between access to child
care or early education and the propensity of mothers to work (Berlinski and Galiani 2007;
Baker, Gruber, and Milligan 2008; Cascio 2009; Havnes and Mogstad 2011; Fitzpatrick 2012;


                                                   3
and Herbst 2017), a finding that is consistent with leaving the workforce when labor market
opportunities become less compatible with child rearing. That said, other explanations, most
notably the widespread adoption of modern contraceptives and shifting social norms about
female work (Goldin 1977; Boustan and Collins 2014; Mammen and Paxson 2000) could also be
compatible with our results. While we can find little evidence consistent with these alternative
mechanisms, our data does not allow us to rule them out completely.
        Our main empirical findings have important implications both for understanding the
historical evolution of women’s labor supply and the relationship between the demographic
transition and the process of economic development. As Goldin (1995) documents in her
comprehensive study of women’s work in the 20th century, women’s labor supply follows a U-
shape over the process of economic growth, first declining before eventually increasing (see also
Mammen and Paxson 2000). Our results suggest that declining fertility may have contributed to
the upswing in women’s labor supply in much of the developed world during the second half of
the century. Moreover, family policies (Olivetti and Petrolgolo 2017) and childcare costs (Del
Boca 2015; Herbst 2015; and Kubota 2016) likely played a role. At the other end of the
economic development spectrum, our results suggest that the demographic transition to smaller
families probably does not have immediate implications for women’s labor supply and growth.
This in turn reinforces a claim in the demographic transition literature (Bloom, Canning, and
Sevilla 2001) that family planning policies are unlikely to enhance growth through a labor supply
channel (although such policies could still be desirable for other reasons).
        Our paper is organized as follows. We begin by sketching a model highlighting the key
mechanism driving fertility’s impact on labor supply. Section III explains our empirical strategy,
followed in section IV by a description of the data. Section V presents our findings, along with a
series of robustness checks. Section VI analyzes potential channels for our results, and section
VII briefly concludes.
II.     Sketch of a Model
        We show that the differential female labor supply response to children over the
development cycle can be explained within a standard labor-leisure model. Consider a constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function defined over consumption c, leisure d, and
fertility n:



                                                 4

                                                       !   !          ! !       !

where c0 <0 is subsistence consumption and utility from fertility is relative to potential
reproductive capacity N. Equation (1) is a CES variant of the model used by Bloom et al. (2009).
Total time (normalized to 1) is allocated between leisure d, childcare bn (where b is the time cost
per child), labor l, and non-market household work 𝜀:
(2)            1 = 𝑙 + 𝑑 + 𝑏𝑛 + 𝜀
Assuming households do not save, consumption is derived directly from earned income:
(3)            𝑐 = 𝑤𝑙.
Substituting equations (2) and (3) into (1), we obtain the household utility function:
                                                                                               !

where 𝜃 ≡ 1 (𝜌 − 1). Note that in the solution:

               !"         ! !!! ! ! !! !

and 𝜕 ! 𝑙 𝜕𝑛𝜕𝑤 < 0 if 𝜌 ∈ (0,1) or the elasticity of substitution is between (0,∞). Of note, the
model predicts the effect of fertility on labor supply becomes more negative as the wage
increases. As the wage increases, the agent experiences both a substitution and income effect.
The former arises because an increase in the wage causes the price of leisure and the time-cost of
children to also increase, leading to a substitution into labor and out of children. Higher wages
also increase income, which moves households away from labor and toward children. When the
elasticity of substitution is positive, the substitution effects tends to dominate, increasing the



                                                               5
responsiveness of labor to fertility as the wage goes up.4
           In a small number of low-income countries, including pre-WWI U.S., we estimate a
modest positive labor supply response to children. While equation (7) predicts a negative
response, a positive result is possible with a simple extension of the model. Suppose there is a
consumption (e.g., food) cost to children so 𝑐 = 𝑤𝑙 − 𝑘𝑛, and for simplicity set c0 and 𝜀 to zero.
The first-order condition with respect to labor, with rearrangement, now becomes:
                        ! ! !! ! ! ! ! !!! ! !
(8)                𝑙=       ! !!! ! ! !! !
                                                 .

In this case 𝜕𝑙 𝜕𝑛 > 0 is consistent with 𝑘 > 𝛼 ! 𝑏 𝛾 ! 𝑤 ! . An increase in fertility implies an
increased time cost but also a reduction in consumption, making increased labor more valuable.
Since 𝜃 < 0, if the wage or the time cost of children are sufficiently low relative to the
consumption cost, mothers optimally increase labor. In this case, 𝜕 ! 𝑙 𝜕𝑛𝜕𝑤 < 0 without further
assumptions, so we would continue to expect a negative gradient of the fertility-labor
relationship with respect to the wage.5
III.       Empirical Strategy
       Our empirical analysis adopts the standard approach of exploiting twin births and gender
composition as sources of exogenous variation in the number of children to identify the causal
effect of an additional child on the labor force activity of women (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1980;
Bronars and Grogger 1994; Angrist and Evans 1998; and Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2005).
In particular, for twin births, consider a first stage regression of the form:
(9)                   𝑧!"# = 𝛾𝑆!"# + 𝜌𝑤!"# + 𝜋!" + 𝜇!"#
where 𝑧!"# is an indicator of whether mother i in country j at time t had a third child, the
instrument 𝑆!"# is an indicator for whether the second and third child are the same age (twins),

4
    We also considered the consequences of changing wages using the model in Angrist and Evans (1996). That model
                                                                                                         !!   !!   !!
finds that for parent 𝑖 ∈ 1,2 , the change in work in response to fertility can be expressed as ! = −       !

and Evans (1996) show that the total effect of fertility on work time is ambiguous. However, their result is invariant
to the sign of the effect; regardless of the sign, increasing the wage will amplify the response. Since nearly all

𝑤!"# is a vector of demographic characteristics that typically include the current age of the
mother, her age at first birth, and an indicator for the gender of the first child, and 𝜋!" are
country-year fixed effects. 𝛾 measures the empirical proportion of mothers with at least two
children who would not have had a third child in the absence of a multiple second birth.
The local average treatment effect (LATE) among mothers with multiple children is identified
identified from a second stage regression:
(10)                𝑦!"# = 𝛽𝑧!"# + 𝛼𝑤!"# + 𝜃!" + 𝜀!"#
where 𝑦!"# is a measure of labor supply for mother i in country j at time t and 𝛽 is the IV estimate
of the pooled labor supply response to the birth of twins for women with at least one prior child.6
Our baseline twin estimates condition on one child prior to the singleton or twin so that all
mothers have at least two children, as in Angrist and Evans (1998). This restriction provides a
family-size-consistent comparison so that both the same-gender and twins IV study the effect of
a family growing from two to three children.
    While twins are a widely-used source of variation for studying childbearing on mothers’
labor supply, it is by no means the only strategy in the literature. Perhaps the leading alternative
exploits preferences for mixed gender families (Angrist and Evans 1998). Angrist and Evans
estimate a first-stage regression like equation (9) but, for 𝑆!"# , substitute twin births for an
indicator of whether the first two children of woman i are of the same gender (boy-boy or girl-
girl). Again, the sample is restricted to women with at least two children and 𝛾 measures the
likelihood that a mother with two same gendered children is likely to have additional children
relative to a mother with a boy and a girl.
         Both twins and same gender children have been criticized as valid instruments on the
grounds of omitted variables biases. Twin births may be more likely among healthier and
wealthier mothers and can consequently vary over time and across geographic location
(Rosenzweig and Wolpin 2000; Hoekstra et al. 2007; Bhalotra and Clarke 2016; and Clarke
2016). Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009) also argue that twin siblings may be cheaper to raise,
leading to a violation of the exclusion restriction. While the same gender instrument has proven
quite robust for the U.S. and other developed countries (Butikofer 2011), there are many reasons


6
  We also aggregate the results in a procedure that is analogous to a hierarchical Bayesian model with a flat prior. To
identify the gradient, we use a local polynomial smoother with a bandwidth of $1,500, where each country-year
point estimate is weighted by its precision. That has no impact on our inferences (see section V.f.3).

                                                          7
to be cautious in samples of developing countries (Schultz 2008). Among other factors,
households may practice either sex selection or selective neglect of children based on gender
(Ebenstein 2010 and Jayachandran and Pande 2017).
         We adopt the broad view of Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser (2010) that the sources of
variation used in various IV strategies are different and, therefore, so are the biases. As such,
each IV provides a specification check of the other. Besides the basic LATE estimates
underlying the multiple instrument methodology of Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser (2010), we also
report a) a third instrument introduced by Klemp and Weisdorf (2016), which relies on
exogenous variation in the timing of first births; b) twin results at alternative family parities; c)
estimates that control for education and health measures to the greatest extent possible, including
height and body mass index that have been highlighted as key determinants of twin births
(Bhalotra and Clarke 2016); and d) estimates by same gender versus mixed gender twins.7 All
these specification checks display a declining labor supply gradient over development.
         The literature analyzes a number of measures of 𝑦!"# , including whether the mother
worked, the number of hours worked, and the labor income earned. These measures are
sometimes defined over the previous year or at the time of the survey. In order to include as wide
a variety of consistent data across time and countries as possible, we typically focus on the labor
force participation (LFP) of mothers at the time of a census or survey. When LFP is unavailable,
especially in pre-WWII censuses, we derive LFP based on whether the woman has a stated
occupation. Section V.f.3 discusses the robustness of the results to several alternative labor
market measures, including mismeasurement of occupation-based LFP (Goldin 1990).
         In concordance with much of the literature, our standard sample contains women aged 21
to 35 with at least two children, all of whom are 17 or younger. We exclude families where a
child’s age or gender or mother’s age is imputed. We also drop mothers who gave birth before
age 15, live in group quarters, or whose first child is a multiple birth.8 It is worth emphasizing
that the restrictions on mother’s (21-35) and child’s (under 18) age may allay concerns about
miscounting children that have moved out of the household.9 We also experiment with even

7
  Monozygotic (MZ) twinning is believed to be less susceptible to environmental factors. Hoekstra et al. (2007)
provides an excellent survey of the medical literature. Since we cannot identify MZ versus dizygotic (DZ) twins in
our data, we take advantage of the fact that MZ twins are always the same gender, whereas DZ twins share genes
like other non-twin siblings and therefore are 50 percent likely to be the same gender.
8
  These restrictions build on Angrist and Evans (1998). The final restriction takes care of rare cases of triplets.
9
  As a robustness check, we also use information about complete fertility when it is available.

                                                         8
younger mother and child age cut-offs, which additionally provide some inference about
difference in the labor supply response to younger and older offspring. Further sample statistics,
single sample estimates, as well as results when these restrictions are relaxed, are provided in the
Appendix.
        We present our results stratified by time, country, level of development, or some
combination. The prototypical plot stratifies countries-years into seven real GDP per capita bins
(in 1990 U.S. dollars): under $2,500, $2,500-5,000, $5,000-7,500, $7,500-10,000, $10,000-
15,000, $15,000-20,000, and over $20,000. To be concrete, in this example, all country-years
where real GDP per capita are, say, under $2,500 in 1990 U.S. dollars are pooled together for the
purpose of estimating equations (9) and (10). Similarly, countries with real GDP per capita
between $2,500 and $5,000 are also pooled together for estimation, and so on. The plots report
weighted estimates of 𝛾 and 𝛽, and their associated 95 percent confidence interval based on
country-year clustered standard errors, for each bin.10
IV.     Data
We estimate the statistical model using four large databases of country censuses and surveys.
        a.       U.S. Census, 1860-2010
        The U.S. is the only country for which historical microdata over a long stretch of time is
regularly available. We use the 1 percent samples from the 1860, 1870, 1950, and 1970
censuses; the 5 percent samples from the 1900, 1960, 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses; the 2010
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year sample, which combines the 1 percent ACS samples
for 2008 to 2012; and the 100 percent population counts from the 1880, 1910, 1920, 1930, and
1940 censuses.12 Besides additional precision, the full count censuses allow us to stratify the
sample (e.g. by states) to potentially take advantage of more detailed cross-sectional variation.
        IPUMS harmonizes the U.S. census samples to provide comparable definitions of
variables over time. However, there are unavoidable changes to some of our key measures. For


10
   Household weights are supplied by the various surveys or censuses, normalized by the number of mothers in the
final regression sample.
12
   For information on the IPUMS samples, see Steven Ruggles, J. Trent Alexander, Katie Genadek, Ronald Goeken,
Matthew B. Schroeder, and Matthew Sobek, Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: Version 5.0 [Machine-
readable database], Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010. The 100 percent counts were generously provided
to us by the University of Minnesota Population Center via the data collection efforts of ancestry.com. Those files
have been cleaned and harmonized by IPUMS. The 1890 U.S. census is unavailable and U.S. censuses prior to 1860
do not contain labor force information for women. In some figures, we also report single-year estimates from the
1880 10 percent, 1930 5 percent, as well as the 1910, 1920, and 1940 1 percent random IPUMS samples.

                                                         9
example, the 1940 census is the first to introduce years of completed schooling and earnings;
therefore, when we show results invoking education or earnings, we exclude U.S. data prior to
1940. Perhaps most important, the 1940 census shifted our labor supply measure from an
indicator of reporting any “gainful occupation” to the modern labor force definition of working
or looking for work in a specific reference week. Fortunately, there does not appear to be a
measurable difference in our results between these definitions in 1940 when both measures are
available. Nevertheless, there is concern that women’s occupations (Goldin 1990) as well as
fertility (Moehling 2002) could be systemically under- or over-reported, especially in U.S.
census samples for 1910 and earlier. We present a number of robustness checks meant to isolate
these mismeasurement issues in Section V.f.3.13
         For Puerto Rico, we use the 5 percent census samples from 1980, 1990, and 2000 and the
2010 Community Survey, which combines the 1 percent samples for 2008 to 2012. Censuses
prior to 1980 are missing labor force data or reliable information about real GDP per capita.
     b. IPUMS International Censuses, 1960-2015
         IPUMS harmonizes censuses from around the world, yielding measures of our key
variables that are roughly comparable across countries and time. We use data from 212 of the
301 non-U.S. country-year censuses between 1960 and 2015 that are posted at the IPUMS-I
website.15 Censuses are excluded if mother-child links or labor force status is unavailable (83
censuses) or age is defined by ranges rather than single-years (6 censuses).16
     c. North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), 1787-1911
         The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides 18 censuses from Canada,
Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden between 1787 and 1911. As with




13
   While the 1880, 1920, 1930, and 1940 full count censuses are fully harmonized across IPUMS samples, the 1910
full count census is not yet. For our purposes, the most important feature missing from the unharmonized data is
child-mother linkages. Accordingly, we create family links ourselves using the IPUMS rules. The close
correspondence between the estimates for the 1 percent and full count samples for 1910 suggests the absence of
family linkages in the 1910 full count data is not a significant issue (see Figure 5).
15
   This information is as of May 3, 2017.
16
   Similar to the U.S., the international linking variables use relationships, age, marital status, fertility, and proximity
in the household to create mother-child links. Sobek and Kennedy (2009) compute that these linking variables have
a 98 percent match rate with direct reports of family relationships. However, we are not able to compute linkages
that do not include relevant household information on relationship and surname similarity. Unfortunately, this
affects some censuses from Canada and the U.K. The 1971 to 2006 Irish censuses use ages ranges for adults but not
for children younger than 20. Therefore, twin children are identifiable and we do not exclude this data.

                                                            10
IPUMS, these data are made available by the Minnesota Population Center.17 For most samples,
NAPP generates family interrelationship linkages. However, in a few cases (Canada for 1871
and 1881 and Germany18 in 1819) such linkages are not available. In those cases, we use similar
rules developed to link mothers and children in the U.S. full count census. Also, consistent with
the pre-1940 U.S. censuses, labor force activity is based on whether women report an occupation
rather than the modern definition of working or seeking work within a specific reference period,
and education is unavailable.19
     Between the International IPUMS and the NAPP, we are able to build sporadic panels for
four non-U.S. countries – Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland – observed at
different stages of the development cycle. There are five Canadian censuses between 1871 and
2011, four British censuses between 1851 and 1991, eight Irish censuses between 1971 and
2011, and eight French censuses between 1962 and 2011.
     d. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), 1990-2014
        We supplement the censuses with the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).20 From
the initial set of 254 country-year surveys, spanning 6 waves from the mid-1980s onward, we
exclude samples missing age of mother, marital status of mother, current work status, whether
the mother works for cash, birth history, and comparable real GDP per capita. These restrictions
force us to drop the first wave of the DHS, leaving 692,923 mothers in 192 country-years.
        The DHS includes a number of questions that are especially valuable for testing the
robustness of our census results. First, detailed health information allows us to control for
characteristics that may be related to a mother’s likelihood of twinning (Bhalotra and Clarke
2016). Second, we can use an indicator of whether children are in fact twins to test the accuracy
of our coding of census twins.21 To keep the DHS results comparable to the censuses, our

18
   The NAPP 1819 German data is from the small state of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, rather than the whole of
Germany. However, we refer to it as Germany for expositional purposes.
19
   In the NAPP, the occupation definitions are based on the variables occgb, occhisco, and occ50us. Note that the
NAPP occupation classifications are different than those used in the U.S. censuses, with the exception of the
occupational coding used for Canada in 1911.
20
   For additional information about the DHS files see ICF International (2015). The data is based on extracts from
DHS Individual Recode files. See http://dhsprogram.com/Data/.
21
   Appendix Figure A1 illustrates the high degree of correspondence between twinning rates when we define twins
using “real” multiple births and those imputed for children sharing the same birth-year. The DHS has a number of
labor force variables but none that directly compare to those in the censuses. We chose to use an indicator of

                                                        11
baseline DHS estimates identify twins based on the census year-of-birth criterion and consider
only living children who reside with the mother.
     e. Real GDP per Capita
         Real GDP per capita (in US$1990) is collected from the Maddison Project.22 To reduce
measurement error, we smooth each GDP series by a seven year moving average centered on the
survey year. We are able to match 441 country-years to the Maddison data.23 This leaves a total
of 48,423,496 mothers aged 21 to 35 with at least two children in our baseline sample.
     When we split the 1930 and 1940 full population U.S. censuses into the 48 states and DC, we
bin those samples by state-specific 1929 or 1940 income-per-capita.24 The income data are
converted into 1990 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.
         f. Summary Statistics
         Table 1 provides summary statistics separately for the U.S. and non-U.S. samples and by
real GDP per capita bins. Although the first bin (less than $2,500 GDP per capita) is dominated
by DHS samples, most bins have a large number of mothers for both U.S. and non-U.S. samples.
Appendix Table A1 provides additional descriptive statistics and estimates by individual
country-year datasets.
V.       Results
         a. OLS Estimates
We begin with estimates from OLS regressions of the labor supply indicator on the indicator for
a third child and the controls described above. These results do not have a clear causal
interpretation, but they are useful for establishing key data patterns. In Figure 1, we plot the
coefficients for the U.S., the non-U.S. countries, and the combined world sample (labeled “All”),
binned into the seven ranges of real GDP per capita reported on the x-axis ($0-2,500, $2,500-
5,000, etc.). Point estimates and country-year clustered standard errors are provided in Table 2.

whether the mother is currently working since it is most correlated with the IPUMS labor force measures (see
Appendix Figure A2).
22
   See http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm.
23
   In a few minor cases, we were not able to match a country to a specific year but still left the census in our sample
because we did not believe it would have impacted their placement in a real GDP per capita bin. Specifically, the
censuses of Denmark in 1787 and 1801 are matched to real GDP per capita data for Denmark in 1820 and Norway
in 1801 is matched to data for Norway in 1820. Excluding these country-years has no impact on our results. More
importantly, the Maddison data ends in 2010 and therefore censuses or surveys thereafter are assigned their most
recently available real GDP per capita data.

The three samples exhibit a similar pattern. At low levels of real GDP per capita, the OLS
estimate of the effect of children on mother’s labor supply is negative and statistically significant
at the 5 percent level but economically small in magnitude (e.g. -0.022 (0.005) in the lowest
GDP bin). As real GDP per capita increases, the effect becomes more negative, ultimately
flattening out between -0.15 and -0.25 beyond real GDP per capita of $15,000.
        Figure 2 plots the U.S.-only OLS results over time. 26 Blue circles represent IPUMS
samples and red diamonds represent full population counts. These estimates start out negative,
albeit relatively small (e.g. -0.011 (0.004) in 1860 and -0.013 (0.0004) in 1910), decrease from
1910 to 1980, at which point the magnitude is -0.177 (0.001), and flatten thereafter.
        Figure 3 plots the OLS estimates by real GDP per capita separately by time periods (pre-
1900, 1900-1949, 1950-1989, and 1990+). Years prior to 1950 combine U.S. census and NAPP
data. Years thereafter include all four of our databases. The same general pattern appears within
time periods.29 The effect of fertility on labor supply tends to be small at low levels of GDP per
capita but increases as GDP per capita rises.
        b. Twins IV
        The left panel of Figure 4 shows the first-stage effect, 𝛾 in equation (9), of a twin birth on
our fertility measure, the probability of having three or more children. For the U.S., non-U.S.,
and combined world samples, there is a positive and concave pattern, with the first-stage
increasing with higher real GDP per capita up to $15,000 or so and flattening thereafter. Note
that the regression specification controls for the mother’s age, but does not, indeed cannot,
control for the number of children or target fertility. Therefore, the positive gradient over real
GDP per capita reflects the negative impact of income on target fertility and hence the
heightened impact of a twin birth on continued fertility relative to a non-twin birth.30 In all cases,
the instrument easily passes all standard statistical thresholds of first-stage relevance, including
among countries with low real GDP per capita and high fertility rates.


26
   Appendix Figure A3 shows similar evidence for a sporadic time-series from Canada, France, Ireland, and the U.K.
29
   Relative to Figure 1, we combined some real GDP per capita bins because of small sample sizes within these tight
time windows.
30
   The first stage coefficient, 𝛾, is E{z=1|S=1,w} – E{z=1|S=0,w}. Mechanically, E{z=1|S=1,w}=1 because of the
definition of twins. This means that if, for example, 𝛾=0.6, then E{z=1|S=0,w}=0.4, implying that 40 percent of
mothers would have a third child if their second child is a singleton. The increasing coefficient over real GDP per
capita means having a third child after a singleton second child is declining with development. The reversal of this
pattern at real GDP per capita of $10-15,000 in the U.S. represents the Baby Boom.


                                                        13
        The right panel of Figure 4 (and Table 2) plots 𝛽, the instrumental variables effect of
fertility on mother’s labor supply. In the world sample, 𝛽 is mostly statistically indistinguishable
from zero among countries with real GDP per capita of $7,500 or less. Subsequently, 𝛽 begins to
decline and eventually flattens out between -0.05 and -0.10 at real GDP per capita of around
$15,000 and higher.32 The results for the U.S. and non-U.S. samples are similar in that there is a
notable negative gradient with respect to real GDP per capita. For example, above $20,000, the
U.S. estimate is -0.070 (0.008) while the non-U.S. estimate is -0.105 (0.003). The U.S. (non-
U.S.) estimate implies that an extra child is associated with a decrease in a mother’s labor supply
of around 11 (14) percent, relative to an average base rate of 62.9 (73.6) percentage points (e.g. -
0.070/.629=-0.111).
        In Figure 5, we show the U.S. twin results by census decade. The pattern is broadly
similar to the previous figure. The magnitude of the first stage is increasing over time, and the
second-stage IV results exhibit a pronounced negative gradient, particularly post-WWII.33 Figure
6 shows that the negative gradient appears in four other developed countries in which we have
longer, albeit more sporadic, time-series. In three of those countries – Canada, U.K., and Ireland
– we explicitly estimate a near zero 𝛽 at a low-income period and an economically large and
negative 𝛽 in a high-income period in their history. Finally, the same pattern arises within time
periods (Figure 7), datasets (Appendix Figure A4), and geographic regions of the world
(Appendix Figure A5). We think it is particularly notable that the declining 𝛽 appears prior to the
wide-spread availability of modern fertility treatments like IVF in wealthy countries and after
modern census questions on labor force participation and fertility were introduced in 1940. We
further address these potential issues below.
        c. Are There Positive Labor Supply Effects Among the Lowest Income Countries?
        One surprising finding is that at low real GDP per capita levels, we sometimes estimate a
positive labor supply response to childbearing. This result is particularly evident in pre-WWI
U.S., displayed in Figure 5, but also periodically appears, although not always statistically


32
   By comparison, Angrist and Evans (1998) report a twins IV estimate of -0.079 for the 1980 U.S. census. Vere
(2011) estimate twins IV coefficients for a third child of -0.086, -0.095, and -0.078 for 1980, 1990, and 2000,
respectively.
33
   In our binned samples, we only include the U.S. full population for 1880 and 1910 to 1940. However, we display
the single-year estimates from the IPUMS random samples for these years in Figures 2 and 5. We take the high
degree of correspondence between the 1910 IPUMS and full population estimates as validation of our
implementation of mother linkages.

                                                       14
significantly so, for some low-income, post-1990 countries. The U.S. positive results are not
statistically different from zero for the early census samples (1860, 1870) but are for the full
population counts of 1880 and 1910.
        While these positive results are not artifacts in the statistical sense, it is worth noting that
the underlying rates of labor force participation for U.S. women are very low at this time in
history (e.g. 6.2 and 11.8 percent for 1880 and 1910 mothers, respectively). As such, a positive
effect could reflect that low-income mothers are more likely to work after having children, for
example because subsistence food and shelter are necessary, whereas childcare might be cheaply
available. Section II discusses a simple extension to our theoretical model, the introduction of a
consumption cost to children, which implies the potential for a positive labor supply response to
additional children. Such a framework may be especially relevant for the subpopulation of
compliers for the local average treatment effect – that is, mothers induced to have children who
would not have otherwise.
        To gain further insight into the low real GDP sample results, we split the U.S. 1930 and
1940 full population counts by state of residence and pool states into income-per-capita
estimation bins (matching what we did with countries in previous figures). Figure 8 shows the
now familiar upward sloping pattern to the first stage results by real income per capita. In the
second stage, we see that the effect of fertility on labor supply is in general statistically
indistinguishable from zero at low-income levels in 1930 and 1940 and overlaps with the low-
income post-1990 non-U.S. results (shown in the green line). But we also find a small positive
effect from the lowest income states in 1930, seemingly corroborating the positive estimates
from a lower income U.S. prior to WWI.35 These findings are directionally consistent with
Godefroy (2017) and Heath (2017).
        d. Same Gender IV
        Next, we discuss results, displayed in Figure 9 and Table 2, that use the same gender
instrument. Like the twins IV, we estimate a positive gradient to the first stage with respect to
real GDP per capita, although the interpretation of this pattern is different than for twins. In
particular, the same-gender first-stage picks up the increased probability that a mother opts to
have more than two children based on the gender mix of her children (rather than picking up the


35
 For the 1930 census, the states in that lowest bin ($2,000-3,000) are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi,
North Carolina, North Dakota, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

                                                        15
proportion of mothers with incremental fertility when the twin instrument is zero, i.e., for non-
twin births). Most importantly, we again see a negative gradient on the second stage IV
estimates, from a close-to-zero effect among low GDP countries to a negative and statistically
significant effect at higher real GDP per capita that flattens at around $15,000. As with the twins
estimates in Figure 5, the negative estimates appear in the U.S. post-WWII (Appendix Figure
A6). 37
          Our main intention is to highlight the similar shapes of the labor supply effect across the
development cycle, despite using instruments that exploit different sources of variation. Indeed,
when we combine all possible instrument variation into a singled pooled estimator, as in Angrist,
Lavy, and Schlosser (2010), our weighted average twin and same gender IV results also,
unsurprisingly, shows the same strong negative gradient. That said, the magnitude of the same
gender IV result is larger than the twin IV result at the high GDP per capita bins.38 Since this is a
local average treatment effect, this disparity suggests a greater effect of fertility on labor supply
for those women encouraged to have an incremental child based either on son preference or the
taste for a gender mix compared to those induced to higher fertility by a twin birth.
          e. Hours
          The results thus far are for the participation decision. Figure 10 plots twin IV results for
the number of hours worked per week conditional on working. We include all country-years that
contain a measure of hours worked, which unfortunately limits us to only 39 censuses.39
Nevertheless, we again find no evidence of a labor supply response among mothers in low-
income countries and a negative response of about 0.85 (0.28) hours per week among mothers in
higher-income countries. As a benchmark, employed mothers work, on average, just under 33
hours per week in countries with real GDP per capita above $20,000, suggesting a roughly 2½
percent average decline in hours as a result of an additional child, conditional on working.
          f. Robustness
          This section describes a series of tests examining the consequence of omitted variables
bias, alternative benchmarks of development, and a variety of variable definition, specification,
37
   Like the twins estimates, we also find systematic evidence of a positive fertility-labor supply effect at low levels
of income, which are statistically significant for the 1910, 1930, and 1940 U.S. censuses (see Appendix Figure A6).
38
   For example, at the $20,000 and above bin, the twin estimate is -0.070 (0.008) for the U.S. sample and -0.105
(0.003) for the non-U.S. sample. By comparison, the same gender estimates are -0.121 (0.008) for the U.S. sample
and -0.173 (0.019) for the non-U.S. sample.
39
   We use eight U.S. censuses (1940-2010) and 31 International IPUMS censuses. The DHS and NAPP do not
contain hours worked per week. When hours are reported as a range, we use the center of the interval.

                                                          16
and sampling considerations.
        f.1 Omitted Variables and Alternative Sources of Identification
        Twin and same gender instruments are susceptible to omitted variables biases. These
biases are likely to differ across instrument, suggesting that the twins and same gender IV
estimates can be viewed as specification checks of each other (Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser
2010). However, in this subsection, we push this idea further by describing three other sets of
estimates that exploit alternative sources of instrument variation or control for observable
characteristics that are known to explain variation in the treatment.
        First, we examine a third instrument for fertility – the time that elapses between the
parents’ marriage and the couple’s first birth (“time to first birth” or TFB) – introduced by
Klemp and Weisdorf (2016). A long line of research in demography and medicine (Bongaarts
1975) uses birth spacing, not necessarily limited to first births, as an indicator of fecundity.
While there is mixed evidence on the extent to which spacing is idiosyncratic (Feng and Quanhe
1996; Basso, Juul, and Olsen 2000; and Juul, Karmaus, and Olsen 1999), Klemp and Weisdorf
argue that TFB is especially hard to predict based on observable characteristics outside of parent
age and consequently is a valid indicator of ultimate family size. Because TFB requires marriage
and birth dates, which are only available in the DHS, we cannot replicate the negative gradient
across the development cycle. However, we do find that the TFB IV estimates are economically
small and positive and statistically similar to twin IV and same gender estimates at the same low
real GDP per capita level.40
        Second, our baseline twin estimates condition on families with one child and compare
those who then have a twin birth to those who have a singleton birth. Following Angrist, Lavy,
and Schlosser (2010), we condition on different family size parities to capture variation from
different sets of mothers. For example, one might expect that mothers with a large number of
previous children would be less likely to adjust their labor supply in response to unexpected
incremental fertility (for example, because of low incremental childcare costs for higher births).
Indeed, as shown in Figure 11, we observe a stronger first stage effect for the sample that
conditions on more children, especially at higher income levels. In the second stage, we see a
notably, although not always statistically significantly, more negative effect in high-income


40
  The TFB IV estimates using the DHS data are: 0.031 (0.018), 0.047 (0.015), and 0.044 (0.014) for the $0-2,500,
$2,500-5,000, and $5,000-10,000 GDP per capita bins, respectively.

                                                       17
countries for women starting with one child. However, the pattern of results is similar regardless
of how many children are in the household when the twins are born. In all non-zero family size
circumstances (up to three initial children), we continue to find no effect among low-income
countries and an increasingly larger negative effect among higher income countries, flattening
out around $20,000 per capita.41 The robustness of the negative gradient to family parity may
also speak to the likely robustness of our result to looking at first children, although of course we
cannot directly test this conjecture with our instruments.42
         Third, it has been noted by many researchers, most recently Bhalotra and Clarke (2016),
that mothers of twins may be positively selected by health and wealth.43 We provide two
additional pieces of evidence that this selection process is not driving the negative labor supply
gradient. When we control for the observable characteristics that have been highlighted by
Bhalotra and Clarke (2016), such as mother’s education, medical care availability, and mother’s
health, our results are statistically identical to the baseline estimates without these controls.44 In
addition, a strand of the medical literature argues that the proportion of dizygotic twins is
affected by environmental and genetic factors of the type discussed by Bhalotra and Clarke
(2016). By contrast, the proportion of monozygotic twins appears to be relatively constant over
time and less affected by their omitted variables bias concern.45 In Figure 12, we report that

41
   Additionally, we restrict the DHS sample to mothers whose report their ideal number of children as less than three
(or four) and obtain nearly identical point estimates. This test loosely addresses concern that the parities we consider
would not be binding and, consequently, have no labor supply effect in high-fertility, low-income countries.
42
   Unfortunately, by construction, the twin, same gender, and time to first birth instruments are unable to identify the
labor supply effect from an unexpected first child. The best causal evidence on the impact of first births uses
childless mothers undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Interestingly, Cristia (2008) and Lundborg,
Plug, and Rasmussen (2016) find large negative labor supply responses to successful IVF treatment in the U.S. and
Denmark, respectively. By contrast, Aguero and Marks (2008, 2011) find no impact among 32 developing countries.
While, we cannot replicate these findings with our data, the patterns seem to further validate a negative labor supply
gradient across all family parities.
43
   Relatedly, Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009) argue twins are less costly to raise than two singleton births spaced
apart. While we cannot fully address this concern, we can restrict the analysis to mothers with close birth-spacing.
Appendix Figure A7 shows that this restriction has little impact on our results.
44
   Appendix Figure A8 plots the results with and without mother’s education covariates using all available censuses
and the DHS. Health measures are available only in the DHS. We are able to roughly replicate Bhalotra and Clarke’s
association between twinning and doctor availability, nurse availability, prenatal care availability, mother’s height,
mother’s BMI (underweight and obese dummies), and infant mortality prior to birth. When we specifically control
for these measures, our labor supply IV estimates are identical to the baseline for the <$2,500 bin and only slightly
larger but statistically and economically indistinguishable for the $2,500-$5,000 bin (-0.006 (0.031) versus 0.012
(0.028)) and $5,000 and over bin (-0.075 (0.042) versus -0.043 (0.039)).
45
   We cannot identify monozygotic and dizygotic twins in our data but we can exploit the fact that monozygotic
twins are always same gender, whereas dizygotic twins are an equal mix of same and opposite gender (like non-twin
siblings). The rate of monozygotic twinning is approximately 4 per 1000 births and is constant across various
subgroups (Hoekstra et al. 2007). Under the standard assumption that dizygotic twins have a 50 percent chance of

                                                          18
results are statistically indistinguishable across same and opposite gender twins, lending
additional credence to the view that our results are not driven by omitted variable bias with
respect to twinning.
        f.2 Alternative Development Benchmarks
        The labor supply patterns we have documented thus far are based on an economy’s real
GDP per capita. The key model prediction, however, is based on the substitution and income
effects arising from changes to a woman’s wage. Unfortunately, data limitations make it difficult
to show world results stratified by female (or overall) wages. However, for the 1940 to 2010 U.S.
censuses, we can compute average female real wage rates by state and census year.46 Results are
presented in Figure 13, stratifying observations into four real hourly wage bins, ranging from
under $6 to over $12 per hour, based on the average wage in the state at that time. Similar to the
GDP per capita results, we find no labor supply effect at the lowest real wage levels and larger
negative effects as the real hourly wage rises. Second, again for a subset of the sample, we can
stratify by the average education level of women aged 21 to 35 (Figure 14).47 We again find no
effect at low education levels (below 9 years) but decreasing negative effects thereafter. Third,
and perhaps more directly tied to Schultz (1991), we find the same pattern by agricultural
employment. In this case, the negative gradient begins when agricultural employment drops
below 15 percent.
        f.3 Other Data, Specification, and Modeling Issues
        Several variable definition choices that we make in our baseline estimates could
conceivably be problematic, including a) using calendar year to identify twins, b) using
occupation to define LFP in historical censuses, and c) counting non-biological children. We
discuss each of these issues in turn.
        Since few censuses record multiple births or the birth month/quarter, out of necessity we

being the same gender, approximately 43 to 59 percent of same-gender twins are monozygotic across the various
GDP bins. Notably, the proportion of monozygotic twins will be highest in low-GDP countries, where Bhalotra and
Clarke (2016) find the potential for the omitted variable bias is greatest.
46
   There is no wage data prior to 1940. For all persons aged 18 to 64, we calculate the average hourly wage rate as
annual earned income divided by weeks worked times hours worked per week. The age range overlaps with the
cohort of mothers used in our baseline sample but we do not condition on gender or motherhood. The results are
robust to using the average wage rate of men or women only as well. Wages are inflation adjusted using the
consumer price index to 1990 dollars and winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles in each census prior to taking
means.
47
   Again, data availability limits our analysis to 1940 and later. We also exclude 30 country-years where years of
education are not provided. By 1940, U.S. women in their twenties and thirties had, on average, at least 9 years of
education. Consequently, the U.S. is included only in the two highest education bins (9 to 12 and 12+ years).

                                                        19
label siblings born in the same year as twins. Naturally, this classification raises the risk that two
births in the same calendar year could be successive rather than twins (so-called Irish twins).
Fortunately, for a subset of our data, quarter or month of birth or direct measures of multiple
births are available. Figure 15 presents results using both definitions of twins. By and large, we
see a very similar negative gradient despite notably nosier estimates from a smaller sample of
country-years with month or quarter of birth.48
        Second, our historical results (in the U.S., 1930 and earlier) use an occupation-based
measure of labor force participation. Post-1940, we switch to the modern LFP definition based
on whether the person is working or searching for work at the time of the survey. When both
LFP measures are available, initially and most prominently in the 1940 U.S. census, changing
LFP definitions has no impact on our results. Using the full population 1940 U.S. census, we find
a 0.95 cross-state correlation between the two measures and a 0.82 cross-state correlation of the
IV results (Appendix Figure A9). More generally, Figure 16 illustrates the same general pattern
of results when using: a) an occupation-based LFP for all censuses (U.S. and non-U.S.) that
contain occupation, b) an indicator of whether the mother is employed at the time of the
census/survey or c) an indicator of whether the mother worked over the prior year.
        Despite the correspondence between the modern definition of LFP and the historical
occupation-based results, there is still valid concern that specific women’s occupations are
misreported prior to 1940 and therefore could bias our results. In particular, Goldin (1990)
highlights the mismeasurement of agricultural women workers in cotton growing states, an
undercount of women in manufacturing, and mismeasurement of boardinghouse keepers. While
it is not possible to directly address the issues raised by Goldin, Figure 17 presents pre-1940
results that individually and simultaneously adjust the sample or outcome variable for each of
these concerns.49 Again, the findings are qualitatively similar to our baseline.
        Another measurement concern relates to non-biological children and children who have
left the household. Data identifying biological children are not consistently available across
censuses. However, when we have information on the number of children to which a mother has
48
   By comparing the baseline and year-of-birth twin lines which both use the year-of-birth twin definitions but run
regressions on different samples, it appears that the low-income country-years with month and quarter of birth are
biased away from zero whereas the opposite is the case for high-income countries. Nevertheless, the line with twins
defined by month or quarter of birth still exhibits a negative gradient.
49
   That is, we exclude women in cotton growing states and who list their industry as manufacturing. As an upper
bound for boardinghouse keeper employment, we recode women as employed if the household has any members
who identify their relationship to the household head as a boarder.

                                                        20
given birth, we find that restricting our sample to mothers where this number matches the total
number of children in the household has little impact on the results (see Figure 18). This
restriction addresses concerns resulting from infant mortality, older children moving out the
household, and complications resulting from step-children and children placed into foster care
(Moehling 2002).
         More broadly, we find it reassuring that the key pattern in the data is preserved when
excluding the lower quality, pre-1940 data altogether. Namely, the female labor supply response
to children in 1940 was economically small (Figures 5 and A6) and only gets significant post-
1940. This pattern suggests that our main findings are not driven by inconsistent historical data
and sampling. In addition, our various robustness checks suggest that data issues are not the
reason for the relatively constant labor supply response to children in the half century or so
leading up to WWII.
         Finally, our findings are robust to a number of other reasonable tweaks to our
specification, variable definitions, and sample selection. For example, we find larger negative
effects among single (relative to married) and younger (relative to older) mothers and children,
especially in countries with higher GDP per capita (see Appendix Figures A10 to A12). Still, all
these cases exhibit the same negative gradient across the development cycle. There is no
statistical or economic difference by mother’s education at any level of GDP per capita
(Appendix Figure A13).50 We also find that weighting, specification, and modeling choices --
including using the methods proposed by Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2010) and Bisbee et al.
(2017) to reweight our IV estimates to the covariate distribution of compliers in the 1980 U.S.,
weighting each sample equally, or using a Bayesian hierarchical model to smooth each country-
year estimate -- have no substantive impact on the results (Appendix Figures A14 to A17).
VI.      Channels
         This section explores some of the potential mechanisms that account for the remarkably
robust negative income gradient of mother’s labor supply response to children.51
         a. Accounting for Base Rates of Labor Force Participation

50
   Angrist and Evans (1998) report a moderate difference in the mother labor supply elasticity by her education. We
can roughly replicate their results but find that their reported difference is sensitive to census year and instrument.
Regardless, the labor supply response to children is economically large and negative for all education levels.
51
   As the main area of interest is the causal labor supply effect of children and the strength of the instruments are
apparent, we stop reporting the first-stage estimates. For brevity, we concentrate solely on the second-stage twin
estimates.

                                                          21
         One possibility is that the negative gradient is simply a function of the base rate of labor
force participation. With respect to our theoretical model, a lower base rate of labor force
participation would imply more corner (𝑙 = 0) cases, for which there is no scope for a negative
fertility effect on labor supply. This mechanically limits the scale of any average causal effect of
fertility. We can account for this possibility by rescaling estimates to the relevant base rate
(Angrist, Pathak, and Walters 2013). The rescaling relies on the assumption that effects tend to
be monotonic in the population under study. That is, write the average effect in population s as
(11)               𝛽! = 𝐸! 𝑌! − 𝑌! ,
where 𝑌! and 𝑌! are potential labor outcomes (with support {0,1}) under the condition of three or
more children and less than three children, respectively. Effect monotonicity implies 𝑌! ≤ 𝑌! ,
which also means
(12)              𝐸! 𝑌! − 𝑌! |𝑌! = 0 = 0.


This further implies that
(13)              𝛽! = 𝐸! 𝑌! − 𝑌! 𝑌! = 1 E! [𝑌! ],
in which case the average effect of having three or more children among those for which there
can be an effect is given by
(14)                                                    𝛽!
                   𝛽!! = 𝐸! 𝑌! − 𝑌! 𝑌! = 1 =                   .
                                                      E! [𝑌! ]
Comparing trends in 𝛽! versus 𝛽!! allows us to assess the influence of base participation rates.52
         Given that we are estimating complier LATEs via IV, the populations indexed by s
correspond to the compliers in our various country years. As such, the relevant base rate, 𝐸! [𝑌! ],
corresponds to the labor force participation rate among compliers with instrument values equal to
0. We compute these complier-specific rates using the IV approach of Angrist, Pathak, and
Walters (2013).53

52
   This rescaling recovers a meaningful effect in populations for which the monotonicity assumption is reasonable.
Rescaling would not be valid in country-years, such as those described in Section V.c, where we estimate
statistically significant positive fertility effects. Our figures are based on samples that include positive estimates,
except for the pre-1920 U.S. which shows the most consistently positive results. If we apply our rescaling strategy to
country-year samples for which we observe either negative or (statistically indistinguishable from) zero fertility
effects, we still recover a comparable negative gradient, although, unsurprisingly, labor supply responses at all real
GDP per capita levels become more negative.
53
   Specifically, we stack the two-stage estimation used in Angrist, Pathak, and Walters (2013) to calculate the
complier-control mean with our baseline two-stage least squares regression to get the covariance between the base
rate and the labor supply effect.

                                                          22
       Figure 19 shows the rescaled baseline twins estimates. For the U.S., the rescaling results
in a substantial flattening past $7,500 per capita. For the non-U.S. populations, the rescaled
estimates are consistent (taking into account the uncertainty in the estimates) with a flattening
after $10,000 per capita. However, a negative gradient is still evident over lower levels of
income. This indicates that the decline in the labor supply effect of an additional child is not
solely driven by increases in the base rate of mother’s LFP and motivates further analysis into
the channel driving the negative gradient, particular over income levels under $10,000 per capita.
The analyses below examine results both with and without the base-rate rescaling.
       b. Changes to the Income and Substitution Effect Across Stages of Development
       We believe much of the remaining negative gradient is due to a declining substitution
effect, in combination with an unchanging income effect, resulting from increasing wages for
women during the process of economic development.
       We identify the substitution effect primarily through changes in job opportunities. This
exercise is motivated by previous work that documents a U-shape of female employment with
development in the U.S. and across countries (Goldin 1995; Schultz 1991; Mammen and Paxson
2000). Schultz (1991) shows that the U-shape is not observed within sector. Rather, it is
explained by changes in the sectoral composition of the female labor force. Specifically, women
are less likely to participate in unpaid family work (mostly in agriculture) and self-employment
and more likely to be paid a wage in the formal sector in the later stages of the development
process. In addition, we have reason to believe that the changes in the types of jobs that women
have over time might become less compatible with raising children. For example, in rural,
agricultural societies, women can work on family farms while simultaneously taking care of
children, but the transition to formal urban wage employment is less compatible with providing
care at home (Jaffe and Azumi 1960; McCabe and Rosenzweig 1976; Kupinsky 1977; Goldin
1995; Galor and Weil 1996; Edwards and Field-Hendrey 2002; and Szulga 2013).
       Given that consistent information on occupations and sectors across our many samples is
limited, we rely on two coarse indicators of job type that can be consistently measured in almost
all of our data. First, we try to capture the distinction between urban/rural and formal/informal
occupations by changing the outcome to be whether women work for a wage or work but are
unpaid. These results, unscaled (left) and scaled (right), are presented in Figure 20. We find the
changing relationship between fertility and labor supply is driven by women who work for


                                                 23
wages. The response from women who are working but not for wages is small and statistically
indistinguishable at different levels of real GDP per capita. Note again, that, since these are
rescaled estimates, the gradient – or lack thereof – is driven not by changes in aggregate levels of
labor force participation at different levels of GDP per capita, but by changes in the sectoral
composition of the labor force.
         A second proxy of sectoral shifts is whether women work in the agricultural or non-
agricultural sectors (Figure 21). Although the scaled results presented in the right plot are
unfortunately noisy for agricultural labor, the labor supply response of women in non-
agricultural sectors becomes clearly more negative as real GDP per capita rises. We also observe
in Figure 22 that fertility has almost no differential effect across the development cycle on
female labor supply to professional occupations, despite the fact that these occupations tend to
have higher wages.54 Instead, the changing gradient seems to be driven entirely by women who
work in non-professional occupations, suggesting either that education and professional status
are poor proxies for the substitution effect or that the opportunity differences they capture are
small in comparison to the sectoral shifts out of agricultural and non-wage work. 55,56
         By contrast, we believe the income effect of rising wages is likely small and invariant to
the stage of development. We show this in two ways. First, we look at the husband’s labor
supply response to children using the same twin IV estimator. A long literature, tracing back to
classic models of fertility such as Becker (1960) and Willis (1973), argues that an increase to the
husband’s wage increases the demand for having children, possibly because men spend less time
rearing children. That is, the income effect is dominant. In Figure 23, we return to the unscaled
estimates and show that the husband’s labor supply response is economically indistinguishable
from zero and invariant to the level of real GDP per capita. Second, we use the 1940 to 2010


54
   Professional occupations are defined somewhat differently across data sources. For the U.S., we define
professionals as Professional, Technical, or Managers/Officials/Proprietors. This definition corresponds to 1950
occupation codes 0-99 and 200-290. In all non-U.S. sources, we define professionals as close as possible to the U.S.
For IPUMS-I, we use the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) occupation codes. For the
NAPP, we use the Historical ISCO codes, except for 1911 Canada where we use 1950 U.S. occupation codes. We
dropped the 1851 and 1881 U.K censuses due to difficulty convincingly identifying professionals.
55
   The fertility response literature has long used a woman's education to proxy for the type of jobs and wages
available to her. While Gronau (1986) documents several results finding education is correlated with a fertility
response, this correlation appears to reverse once Angrist and Evans (1998) apply instrumental variables. While we
are able to replicate their results, we find that this education gradient is sensitive to instrument and the sample used.
Overall, we find no strong heterogeneity by education (Appendix Figure A13).
56
   Note that 𝜕 ! 𝑙 𝜕𝑛𝜕𝑤 becomes more negative as the level of the mother’s wage declines. Thus the model predicts
that the negative gradient will be sharper among lower-skilled women.

                                                           24
U.S. censuses, which contain hourly wages of husbands, to measure the differential labor supply
response of married women throughout the hourly wage distribution of their spouse. In Figure
24, mothers are stratified into three groups based their husband’s real wage (under $10, $10-$16
and above $16 measured in 1990 dollars).57 Generally, we find no differential response, again
suggesting that the income effect is unlikely to be a driver of the negative gradient in the labor
supply response to children over the development cycle.
           c. Child Care Costs
           A key factor driving the relationship between mother’s labor supply and children is the
time cost of raising kids.58 One simple indication that child care costs could be a relevant channel
is visible in Figures 25 and 26, which stratify the samples by six year age bins of the oldest or
youngest child respectively. Regardless of kids’ ages, we find a negative gradient, with the labor
supply elasticity declining at real GDP per capita around $7,000 to $15,000. However, the
gradient is monotonically sharper for families with younger children who typically require more
care, and especially among mothers in non-professional occupations with younger children
(Table 3).59 In particular, among mothers with a child under 6, the impact of a child on working
in a non-professional occupation falls by -0.066 (0.010) in countries with real GDP per capita
above $10,000 relative to countries below $10,000.60 By comparison, the non-professional
gradient falls to -0.054 (0.011) and -0.020 (0.021) for mothers with a youngest child between 6
to 11 and 12 to 17. Strikingly, the labor supply gradient among professional occupations is
invariant to the age of the youngest child. These results are at least suggestive that non-
professional mothers, who are most exposed to sectoral shifts over the development cycle, may
also be least likely to be able to pay for childcare costs through formal wage work.
           Ideally, we would test the importance of child care costs using exogenous variation


57
  Figure 24 is an extension of Figure 13, where the states are grouped into bins by the average wage of all 18-64
year-olds and mothers are separated within bins by their spouse’s wage.

59
   There is a monotonic relationship between age of children and time spent on child care. For example, in the U.S.
Time Use Survey, 21-35 year old women with two children at home where one was under 6 spent 2.9 hours per day,
on average, on child care (plus an additional 2.5 hours per day on other household activities). By comparison, when
the youngest child is 6 to 11 or 12 to 17, mothers spend 1.8 and 1.3 hours per day, respectively, on child care. For
the subset of mothers who are not working, child care takes up 6.8 (youngest child under 6), 5.4 (6 to 11), and 4.7
(12 to 17) hours per day.
60
   For exposition and due to sample size concerns that arise when dividing samples too finely, country-years in
Table 3 are sorted into two real GDP per capita bins: above and below $10,000. The bottom row, labeled “gradient,”
is the difference.

                                                                      25
across countries or over time. Unfortunately, we are not aware of such variation that spans our
data. There is, however, a growing literature that uses quasi-experimental variation in access to
child care or early education to study mother’s labor supply in individual countries, including the
U.S. (Cascio 2009; Fitzpatrick 2012; Herbst 2017), Argentina (Berlinski and Galiani 2007),
Canada (Baker, Gruber, and Milligan 2008), and Norway (Havnes and Mogstad 2011).61
Summarizing this literature, Morrisey (2017) concludes that the availability of child care and
early education generally increases the labor supply of mothers, although there is some response
heterogeneity across countries. We view this literature as at least consistent with the possibility
that the negative labor supply gradient may be amplified if child care costs increase because jobs
become less conducive to child rearing, and, if so, this dynamic could be stronger among lower
wage mothers with less flexibility to provide child care to young children (Blau and Winkler
2017).62
        d. Other Explanations
        The evidence from countries for which we have data spanning the development cycle
(see Figures 5 and 6) show that mothers’ labor supply response to children likely falls in the
decades immediately after WWII, a period in which at least two important developments may
have impacted female labor force participation: the introduction and wide-spread usage of
modern contraceptives and shifts in the social norms of female work.
        To explore the importance of birth control pills, we exploit differences in the timing in
which U.S. states allow access to the pill among 18 to 21 year olds (Bailey et. al. 2012). Using
mothers in the 1970 and 1980 censuses and a difference-in-difference design, we could not find
evidence that access to birth control impacted the labor supply decisions of mothers with either
of our main instruments. Combined with a robust cross-sectional negative mother labor supply
gradient over the last couple of decades, when much of the world has access to oral

61
   To take one example, Herbst (2017) is based on the WWII-era U.S. Lanham Act that provided childcare services
to working mothers with children under 12. State variation of funding offered a natural experiment in a period when
we find the aggregate labor supply response of mothers to additional children was close to 0. Herbst reports that
additional Lantham Act child care funding raised mother’s labor force participation.
62
   We have examined non-exogenous sources of variation in childcare costs by splitting country-years by the
propensity at the national level of households to have access to multigenerational living arrangements or pre-school
attendance, sources of childcare that vary across the development cycle (see Ruggles 1994 on multigenerational
families). We compute the share of households in multigenerational living arrangements using our census data and
use pre-school attendance data collected by the World Bank. We find no evidence that either impacts mothers’ labor
supply decisions. Without a fuller model that allows us to understand the sources of variation in multigenerational
families and pre-schools, these results are inconclusive. Nevertheless, they highlight appropriate caution in over-
interpreting the role that child care costs may play in explaining the negative labor supply gradient.

                                                        26
contraceptives, we do not see support for changing access to birth control as an important
explanation of our main findings.
        We looked at two exercises for evidence on the role of changing social norms. Our first
attempt borrows an idea from the important work of Goldin (1977), who traced persistent
differences in black-white female labor force participation to different social norms about female
work by race that arose during slavery. Boustan and Collins (2014) further show that this
disparity persisted into the mid-20th century through the intergenerational transmission of work
norms between mothers and daughters. Following them, we looked for differences in the labor
supply gradient in the U.S. over time by race. We find that the gradients for whites and blacks
follow the same general pattern, with the black labor supply gradient enduring a steeper decline
in the 1950 and 1960 censuses. While interesting in its own right, the lack of any economic or
statistical difference in the pre-WWII period when the labor supply effect of children is zero
indicates that race-specific social norms about female work cannot explain the increasing
costliness of a second child over development, at least in the U.S.
        Secondly, we looked more directly at female work norms using a question from the
General Social Survey (GSS): “Do you approve or disapprove of a married woman earning
money in business or industry if she has a husband capable of supporting her?”63 We calculate
census division-by-census year averages of an indicator of whether a respondent does not answer
“approve” to this question. We then regress census division-by-census year twin IV estimates on
this GSS average, controlling for log state hourly wage and year and state (or division) fixed
effects. We find no association. We also can show that the negative gradient across real
GDP/capita is similar in economic magnitude for the bottom, middle, and top terciles of state-
census years ranked by the share of respondents who do not approve of married women working
outside the home. That is, there is a declining labor supply elasticity between 1970 and 1980 that
flattens out thereafter for each of the three “women work norm” tercile samples. Consequently,
although these tests are limited to the U.S. experience, we see no compelling evidence to claim
that evolving social norms influence our main results.
VII.    Conclusion


63
  This corresponds to the GSS variable: FEWORK, which is asked in every GSS survey wave between 1972 and
1998. GSS surveys are grouped across time according to the closest year to 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The results
are invariant to whether we take out the effect of demographic, education, and income differences of the different
divisions. Unconditional division-year means vary between 14.2 and 43.2 percent

                                                        27
       In her classic monograph of the evolution of women’s work in the United States, Goldin
(1995) documents a U-shaped evolution of women’s labor supply over the 20th century. At the
same time, she notes the paucity of historical causal evidence on the link between fertility and
labor supply. A parallel literature in development economics has investigated the implications of
evolving patterns of fertility in developing countries on economic growth (and implicitly labor
supply). While there have been many notable and pioneering studies on the effect of fertility on
labor supply in developing countries, they naturally tend to focus on single countries or non-
causal evidence.
       Using a twin birth and same gender of the first two children as instruments for
incremental fertility, this paper links these two literatures by examining causal evidence on the
evolution of the response of labor supply to additional children across a wide swath of countries
in the world and over 200 years of history. Our paper has two robust findings. First, the effect of
fertility on labor supply is small, indeed typically indistinguishable from zero, at low levels of
income and both negative and substantially larger at higher levels of income. Second, the
magnitude of these effects is remarkably consistent across the contemporary cross-section of
countries and the historical time series of individual countries, as well as across demographic and
education groups.
       We argue that our preferred interpretation of the results is consistent with a standard
labor-leisure model. As wages increase, individuals face an increased time cost of looking after
children but also experience higher incomes. The former dominates the latter. This substitution
effect seems to arise from changes in the sectoral and occupational structure of female jobs, in
particular the rise of formal, non-professional, and non-agricultural wage work that flourishes
with development. We also show that the negative gradient is steeper among mothers with young
children that work in non-professional occupations and argue that access to child care subsidies
may attenuate the negative gradient, suggesting that the affordability of child care costs may play
a key role in declining LFP during the development cycle.
       It is important to note that our findings are also compatible with other explanations. Over
the two-century-plus horizon we examine, there have been significant shifts in social norms
regarding both work and fertility, a wide-spread adoption of modern contraceptives, and also
plausible changes in the response of mother’s work to fertility (Mammen and Paxson 2000).
While we have provided some indirect evidence from the US against these alternative


                                                 28
mechanisms, our data does not allow us to rule them out completely.
         In discussing the evolution of female labor force participation in the United States,
Goldin (1990) notes that “… women on farms and in cities were active participants [in
labor] when the home and workplace were unified, and their participation likely declined as the
marketplace widened and the specialization of tasks was enlarged.” In examining the relationship
between labor supply and fertility over the process of development, we arrive at a parallel
conclusion. The declining female labor supply response to fertility is especially strong in wage
work that is likely the least compatible with concurrent childcare.
         We see three implications of our results. First, in thinking about the U-shaped pattern of
labor force participation that has been widely document in the economic history literature, our
results suggest that decreases in fertility play an explanatory role. That is, as fertility rates have
declined over the latter half of the 20th century, the responsiveness of labor supply to fertility has
increased, contributing to increases in female labor force participation. Second, among
developing countries, our results however suggest that changes in fertility (such as those
documented in Chatrerjee and Vogl 2017) tend not to have a large impact on labor force
participation, arguing against fertility-reduction policies specifically motivated by women’s labor
force participation and its contribution to growth. Third, at least when it comes to fertility and
labor supply, our results point to a remarkable consilience between historical and contemporary
developing country data, suggesting that each of these disciplines has important insights for the
other.

Notes: This table displays summary statistics for the baseline sample of mothers by real GDP/capita bins. The sample consists of all two-child mothers aged
21 to 35 that were at least 15 when they had their first child, their oldest child is younger than 18, they do not live in group quarters, their first child is not
a multiple birth, and mother and child have no imputations on age and gender. A twin is defined as the second and third child being the same age. The
samples directly correspond to those used in Table 2 and Figures 1, 4, and 9. See the text for more information on weighting and sample selection procedures.

Notes: This table displays OLS, same gender and twin first stage (FS) and second stage (2S) IV estimates of the effect of a third child on mother’s labor force
status using the baseline sample of mothers described in the text and Table 1. See the text for more detail on the outcome variable. Regressions control for
mother’s age, age at first birth, gender of first child (and second child for same gender IV), and country-year fixed effects. Country-year weights are normalized
to the number of mothers in a survey. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country-year level. These estimates are plotted in Figures 1, 4, and 9.

Notes: This table displays second-stage, twin IV estimates of the effect of a third child on the occupational status of mothers
using the baseline sample who also report occupational status. The samples are stratified by the age of the youngest child
(0-5, 6-11, and 12-17). See footnote 51 in the text for a description of the definition of professional and non-professional
occupations. ‘’Gradient” refers to the difference between row 2 (countries with real GDP per capita of at least 10, 000 in
1990$) and row 1 (countries with real GDP per capita under 10, 000 in 1990$). See Table 2 for more detail.

Notes: This figure displays OLS estimates of the relationship between having a third child and mothers’ labor force status
using the baseline sample of mothers in each GDP/capita bin. Matching OLS estimates for U.S. and non-U.S. samples are
reported in Table 2. See notes to that table for more details. 95 percent confidence intervals are displayed but may not
always be visible at the scale of the figure.

Notes: This figure displays twin IV estimates using the baseline sample of mothers for each each real GDP/capita bin.
Panel (a) shows the first-stage estimates of the relationship between twins and having a third child. Panel (b) shows the
second-stage estimates of the relationship between having a third child and mothers’ labor force status. These estimates are
also reported in Table 2. 95 percent confidence intervals based on robust standard errors clustered at the country-year level
are displayed but may not always be visible at the scale of the figure. See also the text and notes to Table 2 for more detail.

Notes: This figure displays twin IV estimates from the 1930 and 1940 full count censuses, binned by state real income per
capita. For comparison, we also plot the post-1990 non-U.S. estimates over the same real GDP/capita range. Income/capita
for U.S. states is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau (see footnote 24). See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure displays same gender IV estimates using the baseline sample of mothers for each each real GDP/capita
bin. Analogous to figure 4, Panel (a) shows the first-stage estimates of the relationship between same gender children and
having a third child and Panel (b) shows the second-stage estimates of the relationship between having a third child and
mothers’ labor force status. These estimates are also reported in Table 2. 95 percent confidence intervals based on robust
standard errors clustered at the country-year level are displayed but may not always be visible at the scale of the figure. See
also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure displays twin IV estimates of hours worked among baseline mothers who are working. Surveys that do
not report information on hours worked are excluded. When hours are reported in ranges, we take the median point of the
range. See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure displays twin IV estimates by the size of the family when the twins were born. For example, the line
labeled “2nd child” includes mothers with one child and where twins are the first and second child born. The line labeled
“3rd child” is our baseline. See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure displays twin IV estimates for U.S. state-years using the 1940 to 2000 censuses and the 2010 5-year
American Community Survey. State-years are grouped by the mean real hourly wage (in 1990$) of workers aged 18 to
64. Wages are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles before the mean is calculated. Hours are imputed at median of
intervelled ranges if continuous measures are not available. See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure uses alternative definitions of twins. The black baseline defines a twin as two kids born to the same mother
in the same calendar year. The blue line (circles) defines twins as being born in the same month or quarter, depending on
the census or survey. See Appendix Table A1 for censuses and surveys where month/quarter or birth is available. The red
line (triangles) uses the baseline definition of twins but the sample of censuses/surveys with month/quarter of birth. See also
the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure reruns the twin IV estimates with alternative measures of work status. The black, blue, and red lines use
whether a mother is in the labor force (baseline), employed, and report any occupation, respectively. The sample is constant
across all three indicators. The green (squares) line uses whether a mother worked in the previous year; these results are
based on a smaller sample of surveys/censuses. See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure shows the sensitivity of our results to accounting for a variety of possible mismeasurement issues in pre-
1940 U.S. occupational status, as identified in Goldin (1990). The blue line drops the deep South (Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); the red line drops mothers who list their industry as manufacturing; the
green line indicates a mother as working if there is at least one boarder in her household; the purple line makes all of these
adjustments simultaneously. The black line is our baseline. Only the first three real GDP/capita bins are impacted and
therefore shown. See also the text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure shows robustness to the exclusion of non-biological children. The blue line (circles) displays second-stage
IV estimates restricting to mothers who report the number of children ever born. The red line (triangles) restricts this sample
to mothers where the number of reported children ever born equals the number of children in the household. See also the
text and notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure rescales the baseline IV estimates by the complier-control mean of mothers’ labor force status. The
calculation of the complier-control mean follows the IV methodology of Angrist, Pathak, and Walters (2013). To get standard
errors, unscaled coefficients and the complier-control mean are calculated in a seemingly unrelated regression framework and
the standard errors of the ratio of the unscaled estimate to the control mean are calculated via the delta method. We exclude
U.S. samples prior to 1920 since these surveys often exhibit strongly positive labor supply responses. See also the text and
notes to Figure 4.

Notes: This figure displays IV estimates, unscaled (panel A) and scaled by the complier-control mean (panel B). The blue
line (circles) changes the outcome to an indicator of whether the mother works for wages. The red line (triangles) changes
the outcome to an indicator of whether a mother works but not for wages. By construction, the sample of mothers is held
constant. See also the text and notes to Figures 4 and 19.

Notes: This figure displays IV estimates unscaled (panel A) and scaled by the complier-control mean (panel B). The blue
line (circles) changes the outcome to an indicator of whether the mother works in agriculture (defined as a farm laborer,
tenant, manager, or owner). The red line (triangles) changes the outcome to an indicator of whether a mother works but not
in agriculture. By construction, the sample of mothers is held constant. See also the text and notes to Figures 4 and 19.

Notes: This figure displays IV estimates unscaled (panel A) and scaled by the complier-control mean (panel B). The blue
line (circles) changes the outcome to an indicator of whether the mother works in a professional occupation. The red
line (triangles) changes the outcome to an indicator of whether a mother works but not in a professional occupation. By
construction, the sample of mothers is held constant. See also the text and notes to Figures 4 and 19.

Notes: This figure displays IV estimates for fathers living in the same household as mothers. The blue line (circles) is our
baseline mother labor supply estimates, restricted to those where the father also lives in the same household. The red line
(trianges) is the analaogous estimate for fathers. See also the text and notes to Figures 4.

Notes: This figure stratifies the twin IV estimates from Figure 13 by the husband’s wage. The sample is therefore restricted
to married mothers with wage information on their spouse in the post-1940 U.S. censuses. See also the text and Figures 4
and 13.
