A Gains from Trade Perspective on Macroeconomic Fluctuations

                                               ABSTRACT

Business cycles reflect changes over time in the amount of trade between individuals. In this paper
we show that incorporating explicitly intra-temporal gains from trade between individuals into a macroeconomic
model can provide new insight into the potential mechanisms driving economic fluctuations as well
as modify key policy implications. We first show how a "gains from trade" approach can easily explain
why changes in perceptions about the future (including "news" about the future) can cause booms
and bust. We then turn to fiscal policy, and discuss under what conditions fiscal multipliers can be
observed. While much of our analysis is conducted in a flexible price environment, we also present
implications of our model for a sticky price environments, as it allows to understand stable-inflation
boom-bust cycles. The source of the explicit gains from trade in our setup derives from simply assuming
that in the short run workers are not perfect mobile across all sectors of the economy. We provide
evidence from the PSID in support of this modeling assumption.

1       Introduction
Changes in measured macroeconomic activity are mainly driven by changes in the volume
of trade between individuals. There are two types of causes to changes in volume of trade
between individuals. On the one hand, it may be that agents’ capacity to exploit existing
gains from trade changes over time due to changes in the importance of frictions or policy
interventions. On the other hand, it may be that the actual scope in gains from trade between
individuals changes. It would therefore seem natural that macro-economic models have at
their core agents which gain from trading with each other in goods markets. However, many
modern macro-models do not have such a feature as they either adopt a representative agent
setup or introduce heterogeneity among individuals that leads only to trades in assets, not
intra-temporal trade in goods. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how an explicit treatment
of intra-temporal gains from trade in a macro setting provides new insights regarding the
mechanisms behind fluctuations and the effects of policy. The main assumption we introduce
in the model to generate trade among individuals is the notion that not all agents are perfect
substitutes in the production of goods from different sectors.
    Using a very simple framework which emphasizes gains from trade between individuals
in investment good sectors versus those in consumption good sectors, we begin by showing
how and under what condition changes in the perceived future returns on capital goods
can lead to a simultaneous expansion of both the consumption good and investment good
sectors. In our framework we do not need to take a stance on whether the perceived changes
in future returns to capital are driven by objective news about future fundamentals (in the
spirit of the “News shock” literature) or whether the perception changes are driven simply
by error or a fad. While there are alternative setups that can also explain the type of
expectation driven fluctuations we focus upon, we will show that the mechanism emphasized
here is very intuitive and has solid empirical foundation. In particular, the mechanism that
drives an expansion in our setup resembles a textbook type multiplier argument whereby
the consumption by one agent of another agent’s goods leads to subsequent demand effects
that expand overall production. For example, if it is perceived that office buildings will be in
high demand in the future, this creates gains from trade between those capable of producing
office buildings and the rest of the agents in the economy. Agents in the rest of the economy
will want to buy-either directly or indirectly-office buildings, and the builders of offices will
accept to build more in exchange for goods produced by others. We show that such a
process naturally leads to a generalized expansion when perceptions are optimistic, and if
the perceptions are reversed, this should lead to a bust. We also show how this multiplier
logic does not rely on sticky prices or departures from the permanent income hypothesis, but
instead relies simply on sectoral labor markets that are not fully integrated in the short run.
In our framework, the set of mutually desirable trades between individuals change solely
due to changes in perceptions about the future value of certain goods. This contrasts with
the RBC literature and many of its spin-offs, in which surprise improvements in technology
directly change the gains from trade.1
    In addition to examining the possibility of perception (or expectation) driven business
    1
     In the RBC literature the notion of variation in the gains from trade between individuals is often not
made explicit due to the representative agent setup, but the setup can easily be reinterpreted to capture this
notion.

cycles, we also show how our framework gives insight into the effects of government spending.
To this end we use our framework to examine the effects of a temporary balanced budget
increase in government spending. If labor markets are fully integrated, then it can be shown
quite generally that temporary changes in government spending cannot lead to an increase in
private consumption nor a multiplier greater than one in an equilibrium setting. However,
if workers are not perfectly mobile across sectors, then depending on the nature of the
tax-spending policy, we show that it can give rise to an increase in private consumption
and possibly a multiplier greater than one. The main issue regarding whether government
spending has a multiplier smaller or greater than one depends in our framework on whether
the fiscal package increases substantially or not gains from trade between the individuals
in the different sectors.2 A salient feature of our analysis is to show how labor market
segmentation can simultaneously help explain both perception driven business cycles and
the occasional expansionary effect of government expenditures.
    While most of our analysis focuses on environments where prices are fully flexible, we
also discuss implications of our gains from trade framework for monetary policy in a sticky
price environment. To examine this issue we extend a quite standard new Keynesian macro-
model to an environment with two sectors where agents are not mobile between sectors.
In this environment we can derive the level of output that is consistent with stable prices.
This level is often referred to as the natural rate. In basic New Keynesian models, changes
in the natural rate are driven by either changes in productivity, changes in preferences or
changes in labor market frictions. In contrast, in our set up changes in the natural rate can
be driven simply by changes in perception about the future.3 Accordingly, in our framework
a wave of optimism which creates more demand will simultaneously increase the natural
rate. What looks like a demand shock –here a wave of demand for capital goods driven by
the perception of high future returns – will not directly put upward pressure on prices, as
in our model the natural rate increases in response to such a shock as it affects the gains
from trade. Such a framework therefore easily explains why optimism lead expansions are
not necessarily inflationary, and why pessimism driven busts may put very little downward
pressure on inflation even when employment is very low.
    The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows. In section 2 we present
our basic framework and derive the competitive equilibrium of the economy. In section 3, we
show how and when changes in perceptions about the future can cause business cycle type
fluctuations if agents are not perfectly mobile across section. As we use an extremely simple
framework, we also discuss the generality of the results. In section 4 we discuss positive
policy implications. We begin by exploring how changes in government spending can affect
aggregate output in our framework. We show that under the same conditions which give rise
to the possibility of perception driven business cycles, we also find that government spending
can cause generalized booms even if the spending is limited to one sector of the economy.
We also examine the implications of our framework for monetary policy in a sticky price
setting. The main aspect we emphasize here is that the concept of a natural rate should
   2
     If workers are fully mobile between sectors, wasteful government spending cannot create such gains
from trade and therefore cannot have a multiplier effect. Therefore, our framework gives a reason why
government expenditures may be used in the short run to stimulate economy activity while such effort would
be unproductive in the long run.
   3
     It is also the case that monetary policy shocks can change the natural rate in our framework.


                                                    2
not be viewed as primarily determined by productive capacity, frictions and preferences, and
independent of what may appear as demand shocks. Instead we show that in our framework
the natural rate is inherently linked to changes in demand type shocks, and therefore even
in such a simple model one cannot view changes in demand as inducing movement along a
stable Phillips curve. The Phillips curve itself will change with demand shocks. Hence in
our setup it is not the case that a supply shock renders a different type of inflation-output
trade-off than that associated with a demand shock. Finally, in section 5, we discuss some
normative issues and explore the relevance of our main assumption regarding labor market
segmentation using PSID data over the period 1968-2007.
    Note that throughout our analysis, our aim is to present the main ideas in the simplest
possible setting. The results presented here are therefore all of a qualitative nature, and
we present examples that can be solved analytically as much as possible. Given our focus
on clarifying the qualitative implications for limited labor mobility, we leave for further
exploration the quantitative implications of our framework.


2        A simple framework for exploring the relationship
         between gains from trade and macroeconomic out-
         comes
2.1        Fundamentals
Let us begin by focusing on the simplest of cases in which we can explicitly model gains from
trade : a two sector model, with two types of agents, one current period and a continuation
value for the investment good.4 One sector produces consumptions goods, and the second
sector produces investment goods, that is, goods that do not provide immediate utility. The
two types of agents are denoted by i = 1, 2, where there is a mass ni of agents of type i.
In period 1, an agent i will have choices in terms of how much of the consumption good to
purchase, C i , how much of the investment good to purchase, K i , and how much labor to
supply, Li . The production functions for consumption and investment goods satisfy constant
returns to scale and depend on the amount hired of each type of labor, i = 1, 2. If the labor
from the different types of worker enter additively in the production function, we will refer
to this as a homogeneous labor market. If only one type of labor enters productively into the
production of a good, we will refer to this as a situation with specialized labor markets. The
function F C (LC1 , LC2 ) will represent the amount of consumption produced when the amount
LCi of type i labor is employed in the consumption good sector. Similarly F K (LK1 , LK2 )
will represent the production function in the investment sector. These production functions
are assumed to be concave and satisfy constant returns to scale.
    The preferences of agent i over consumption and labor in the current period are given
by the utility function U i (C i , 1 − Li ), where U (·, ·) is concave, with both consumption (C i )
and leisure (1 − Li ) being normal goods. This implies that U1 > 0, U2 > 0 , U22 − U12 UU12 < 0
and −U21 + U11 UU21 < 0.5
    4
        This framework embeds fully specified dynamic models, as we will show by means of example
    5
        Subscripts on functions represent partial derivatives.


                                                     3
    Let us denote by Ve i (K i ; S) the value function of agent i who enters next period in state
S with K i units of capital. The state vector relevant for the individual can be seen as
composed of predetermined endogenous variables S1 and of exogenous driving forces S2 .
The predetermined variables entering Ve could be the aggregate values of the capital stocks
for each type of worker (n1 K 1 and n2 K 2 ), while the exogenous random variables affecting
the system could include the aggregate technology realization.6 In the current period, the
agent will be assumed to have information that he perceives as relevant for predicting S,
and this information will be denoted Ω. This information could be individual specific, but
for our purpose we will assume that it represents common information. The objective of the
agent can then be expressed as maximizing

                               U i (C i , 1 − Li ) + E[β Ve i (K i ; S1 , S2 )/Ω],

where E[·/Ω] is the conditional expectation operator based on information Ω, and β is the
discount factor.
    To simply notation it is useful to define the expected continuation value function V i (·)
for agent i as
                             V i (K i ; Ω) = E[β Ve i (K i ; S1 , S2 )/Ω].
We will refer to V i (·) simply as the agent’s value function.

2.2     Modeling changes in expectations
The important aspect to note about V i (·) is its dependence on the information Ω. In
particular, we will be interested in knowing under what conditions changes in the exoge-
nous components of Ω can cause business cycle type fluctuations, that is, we are interested
in knowing when changes in the information set that agents perceive as being relevant for
predicting the future may cause booms or busts7 . We purposely choose to specify future
preferences simply in terms of a continuation function as this will allow us to disregard all
sorts of issues related to future adjustment of individuals. For example, even if we will
sometimes assume that an individual’s labor is specific to a sector, we are not assuming
that this cannot be modified in the future. As we do not need to take a precise stand on
how such issues play out in the future, and we want to highlight our results as easily as
possible, the specification in terms of a continuation functions is very useful and without
much loss of generality. For now all that we require about V i (K i ; Ω) is that it be continuous,
                         i (K i ;Ω)           2 i (K i ;Ω)
differentiable, with ∂V ∂K   i      ≥ 0, and ∂ V ∂K i      ≤0.
    It will be helpful to divide Ω into two sets. First we will denote by Ω1 information variables
which are exogenous to the system, but which individuals consider relevant for predicting
future state variables. For simplicity, we will treat Ω1 as a scalar. Ω1 could represent a
   6
       There may also be a third type of variable that enters S which are economy wide endogenous variables
such as prices. However, since such variables are themselves in equilibrium functions of the predetermined
variables and the driving forces, there is no loss of generality in not including them in our specification of
Ve (·).
     7
       Depending on the context, a change in the exogenous components of Ω can be a change in the conditional
expectation of S when agents are learning or receiving news, but can also correspond to a change in some
higher moments of the distribution of S, for instance a change in the (perceived) variance of S.

current signal that agents receive regarding the future realization of exogenous driving forces
impinging on the system, or alternatively Ω1 could simply represent a perception (sentiment)
that agent share. Ω2 represents a set of endogenous variables that agents may want to use
to predict future states, such as past prices or other past market outcomes.

2.3       Competitive equilibrium
The decision problem for individual i can be expressed as
                                     max U i (C i , 1 − Li ) + V i (K i ; Ω)

                                                   C i + pK i = wi Li ,
where the agent takes prices and wages as given, wi represents the wage paid to agents of
type i, and the consumption good is the numeraire.8 The problem for the consumption good
firm is                                     X
                                    max C −     wi LCi
                                                                i
subject to
                                                  C = F C (LC1 , LC2 ).
The problem for investment good firms is
                                                                X
                                              max P K −                  wi lK1
                                                                    i

                             FiC (n1 LC1 , n2 LC2 )         =           wi ,

                                    n1 C 1 + n2 C2          =           F C (n1 LC1 , n2 LC2 ),
                                   n1 K 1 + n2 K 2          =           F K (n1 LK1 , n2 LK2 ).
   8
      In this setup we are assuming that agents are not initially endowed with capital. The results of this
section can be easily extended to the case where agents are initially endowed with capital and capital enter as
a factor of production in the production of capital goods and/or investment goods. In particular, Propositions
1 and 2 continue to hold in this modified setting. The only difference is for Proposition 3 which would need
to be extended to include a restriction on the effects of capital mobility between sectors.
    9
      By Walras’ Law, one condition here is redundant.

3      Expectation driven fluctuations
3.1     Definitions
We are interested in examining whether, and under what conditions, changes in Ω1 (the exo-
genous component in the agents’ information set) can cause positive co-movements between
consumption, investment and employment. For this purpose, we define a positive change
in Ω1 such that it corresponds to an increase in the perceived marginal (private) return to
                   2 V i (K i ;Ω)
capital, that is, ∂ ∂K   1 ∂Ω
                              1
                                  > 0. We will be interested in isolating conditions under which an
increase in agents’ perception of the marginal return to capital – that is, an increase in Ω1 –
can cause a generalized boom, and when a decrease can cause a bust.10 Since the notion of
a generalized boom and bust can have different meanings in a heterogeneous agent economy,
we define the following terms:

Definition 1 The economy exhibits positive co-movement when aggregate consumption,
aggregate investment, and employment of each type of worker all strictly increase together,
or strictly decrease together.

Definition 2 The economy exhibits (strong) individual positive co-movement if the
individual levels of consumption, investment and hours worked for each agent move weakly
(strictly) in the same direction.

Definition 3 The economy exhibits positive price and quantity co-movement when
wages and the price of capital move weakly in the same direction as aggregate consumption,
investment and employment.

    It should be clear that strong individual positive co-movement implies individual positive
co-movement, which in turn implies positive co-movement. The only difference between
strong individual positive co-movement and individual positive co-movement is that in the
latter case some individual level variables are allowed to remain unchanged. Equipped with
these definitions we can now explore under what conditions changes in perception regarding
the marginal value of capital, represented by changes in Ω1 , can cause positive co-movement.
    When looking at how changes in perceptions may affect the economy, it is unclear what
concepts defined above one may want the economy to satisfy to be considered most empiri-
cally interesting. Positive co-movement between investment, consumption and employment
is one of the central established features of business cycles, so it is certainly desirable that it
is satisfied. Since our framework allows for two types of workers, and since we do not believe
negative correlation between the employment of different types of workers is a key feature
of business cycles, we will focus mainly on situations that satisfy our definition of positive
co-movement. Nonetheless, since we also know of no evidence suggesting that the main pos-
itive co-movements in aggregate consumption and investment hide substantial heterogeneity
in the sign of the response at the individual level, we believe that it is also interesting to
know whether a model can produce positive co-movement by relying only on individual level
  10
      Answering this question simply requires doing a comparative static exercise on the above set of equi-
librium equations.


                                                    6
positive co-movement. Whether the individual level outcomes for consumption and invest-
ment should move strongly or weakly with the aggregates appears to us as being of minor
importance. With respect to positive price and quantity co-movement, the desirability of
this feature may depend on what type of capital one may be considering. We believe that
positive price-quantity co-movement is a potentially desirable feature as real wages are gen-
erally viewed as pro-cyclical; and the price of capital– which we view as representing either
the price of real-estate or value of capital represented by the stock market– is also seen as
being pro-cyclical. However, if one views the price of capital as the price of equipment it is
unclear whether one would want changes in perception to increase or decrease such a price.

3.2    Three propositions
Our first proposition is meant to illustrate that the Walrasian framework is not very re-
strictive in terms of it capacity to generate interesting co-movements in response to changes
in perceptions. In effect, it only places quite mild restrictions in the sense that it cannot
generate strong individual positive co-movement.

Proposition 1 The Walrasian equilibrium of our economy can simultaneously exhibit indi-
vidual positive co-movement and positive price-quantity co-movement in response to a change
in Ω1 , but it cannot exhibit strong individual co-movement.

   To illustrate the first part of this proposition, we provide the following example. The
proof of the second part of the proposition is given in the appendix. In this example the
function V (·) is taken as data. Later in this section we will provide examples where V (·)
can be derived from more primitive assumptions.

Example : Preferences for producer of type 1 agent are given by

                            U 1 (C1 , L1 ) = ln(C1 ) + ν(1 − L1 ),
                            V 1 (K 1 , Ω1 ) = φΩ1 ln(K 1 ),

and preferences of type 2 are

                                U 2 (C 2 , L2 ) = ln(C 2 − aL2 ),
                                V 2 (K 2 , Ω1 ) = ψΩ1 ln(K 2 ).

The production function for consumption goods is C = L1 ; that is only type 1 can produce
consumption goods. The production of investment goods is K = L2 ; that is only type 2 can
produce investment goods. There is a mass one half of each type of individual.

    As can be seen, all these quantities increase with an increase in Ω1 except for C 1 , which
is independent of Ω1 . Hence in this example an increase in Ω1 leads to individual positive
co-movement. Moreover, both the price of capital and the average wage (in consumption
units) increase and therefore it also exhibits positive price-quantity co-movement.
    Note that the only restriction being imposed by Proposition 1 on the Walrasian equilib-
rium is that not all current decision variables of individuals can strictly increase in response
to a perceived change in the marginal value of capital. At least one variable for one indi-
vidual must stay the same or decrease.11 This restriction may appear very minor, which we
believe is the right interpretation. However, it should be noted that in the case where we
impose a representative agent structure, it implies the stronger result that aggregate positive
co-movement is not possible.

Corollary 1 If we have a representative agent, in the sense that the preferences of agents 1
and 2 are identical and their labor is perfectly homogeneous, then the Walrasian equilibrium
of the economy cannot exhibit positive aggregate co-movement in response to a change in Ω1 .

    Corollary 1 echoes the well known result of Barro and King [1984] whereby demand
disturbances were shown not to be able to generate positive co-movement between consump-
tion and employment in a representative agent setup. In Barro and King [1984], the result
was stated in a one sector model, and can seen very easily by examining the labor market
equilibrium condition:
                                  U2 (C, 1 − L)
                                                = F1 (L).
                                  U1 (C, 1 − L)
Under the condition that F11 ≤ 0 and both consumption and leisure are normal, then it
follows from total differentiation of that equation that consumption and labor must move in
  11
     While Proposition 1 indicates that individual positive co-movement induced by a change in perception
can arise in a Walrasian setting, it is worth noting that such an outcome– where there is no decrease in any
of the individual outcomes – arises only when there is constant dis-utility of work. In contrast, aggregate
positive co-movement induced by perception does not rely on such a linearity assumption.


                                                     8
opposite directions when responding to changes in perceptions. Corollary 1 simply provides
an extension to the two sector model.12
    Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 suggest that if one is interested in understanding perception
driven business cycles, remaining in a Walrasian equilibrium framework may be promising
but in such case it is necessary to drop the representative agent structure. However, what
this proposition does not tell us is what aspect of the representative agent framework should
be dropped: is it the identical preferences or the differences in labor. Proposition 2 addresses
this issue.

Proposition 2 If labor is homogeneous, the Walrasian equilibrium of our economy cannot
exhibit positive co-movement in response to a change in in Ω1 . In contrast, if preferences are
identical but labor markets are specialized, then the Walrasian equilibrium of our economy
can exhibit positive co-movement, positive individual co-movement and positive price-quantity
co-movement.

    Proposition 2 indicates that short run labor market segmentation may be a key feature
for understanding certain aspects of business cycle phenomena. In particular the proposition
highlights that it is not preference heterogeneity that is essential for generating perception
driven positive co-movement in our Walrasian setting but instead it is the notion that not
all agents are equally valuable at producing all goods in the short run. When agents are
specialized in the goods they can produce in the short run, this creates a situation where
there are explicit gains from trade between individuals. Accordingly, we interpret Proposition
2 as indicating why it may be relevant to build macroeconomic models where there are
explicit gains from trade in the goods markets between individuals. The reason why labor
market specialization can support perception driven booms and busts is that the change
in perception changes the desirable trades between individuals. For example, when returns
to capital accumulation appear high, agents in the consumption sector want to trade with
workers in the investment sector. Such gains from trade therefore favor a simultaneous
increase in the production of both consumption and investment goods.
    Propositions 1 and 2 indicate that perception driven positive co-movement is possible in
our simple Walrasian framework, but they do not indicate whether such outcomes can arise
in reasonable setups, or whether they require strong additional assumptions. Accordingly,
our aim now is to derive a set of sufficient conditions for the economy to exhibit positive
aggregate co-movement in response to an increase in Ω1 . To this end, as suggested by
Proposition 2, we will assume that agents are specialized in production in the short run,
that is, we will assume that agents of type 1 can only produce the consumption good in
the short run, while agent of type 2 can only produce the investment good, and we look for
sufficient conditions whereby changes in perceptions can cause positive co-movement. As
these production functions have constant returns to scale, there is no loss of generality to
assuming that one unit of labor produces one unit of output in each sector.
    The sufficient conditions for perception driven positive co-movement can be stated in
terms of the primitives U i (·) and V i (·). However, this results in very unintuitive expressions.
For this reason, we will instead proceed by presenting sufficient conditions in terms of demand
and supply functions. In particular, let us define the capital demand function, K i (p, wi ; Ω),
  12
       See also Beaudry and Portier [2007] for a related discussion.


                                                       9
the consumption demand function, C i (p, wi ; Ω), and the labor supply function of agent i,
Li (p, wi ; Ω), as the functions that solve the optimization problem

subject to
                                         C i + pK i = wi Li .
Sufficient conditions for an increase in Ω1 to induce positive aggregate co-movement are given
in Proposition 3.
Proposition 3 If workers are specialized across sectors in the short run, and if the con-
tinuation value for each agent is of the form V i (K i ; Ω1 ), with V12i > 0, then an increase in
Ω1 will be associated with positive aggregate co-movement (and positive quantity and price
co-movement) if
                                                                                     ∂L2
    (i) an increase in wi does not decrease the labor supply of type 2, that is, ∂w    2 ≥ 0,

    (ii) an increase in the price of capital does not decrease labor supply of either type of
                   i
agent, that is, ∂L
                ∂p
                     ≥ 0,
    (iii) An increase in the price of capital leads to a decrease in aggregate capital demand
                                                                            1      2       2

                                                                                         ∂w2
                                                                                             < 0.
    Proposition 3 highlights a set of conditions which together are sufficient to support percep-
tion driven aggregate co-movements. Let us emphasize that substantially weaker conditions
can be found but they are not very elegant to state. For example, the effect of an increase
in the price of capital on labor supply can be negative, as long as it is not too negative.
Similarly, the proposition is stated for the case where agents only use exogenous information
Ω1 to predict future states (Ω2 is either empty or does not affect the marginal return to cap-
ital). This again is much stronger than needed to get positive co-movement, but it greatly
simplifies the proposition.
    The main conditions in Proposition 3 are easy to interpret. The first condition simply
states that the labor supply of agents in the capital goods sector must respond non-negatively
to an increase in their wage, that is , it must be that the substitution effect of an increase in
wages dominates the income effect in this sector. As a change in wages here corresponds to
a change holding all future variables constant (including expected future wages as predicted
by Ω1 ), this condition appears very reasonable. It is quite obvious why such a condition will
need to hold. If an increase in the perceived return to capital is to cause a boom, it will
need to work though an increase in employment of capital sector workers. Such an increase
in unlikely to materialize unless an increased demand for workers in this sector leads to
increased employment.
    More generally, to understand the role of the three conditions in Proposition 3 it is helpful
to notice that the model equilibrium conditions can be reduced to an equilibrium condition
in the capital goods sector. Using the constant returns to scale assumption, and the fact that
the firm’s first order conditions imply – given the simple one-to-one production technology
– that w2 = p and w1 = 1 (where 1 is the price of the consumption good), we can write the
equilibrium condition in the capital sector as:
                          K 1 (p, 1; Ω1 ) + K 2 (p, p; Ω1 ) = L2 (p, p; Ω1 ).

                                                  10
The left side of this equation is the aggregate capital demand curve, and the right side is
the aggregate capital supply curve. Conditions (i) and (ii) in Proposition 3 guarantee that
the capital supply function is (weakly) upward sloping, and condition (iii) guarantees that
the demand is downward sloping, as illustrated in Figure 1.

This economy satisfies the necessary conditions of Proposition 3: aggregate capital supply is
(weakly) upward sloping and aggregate capital demand is downward sloping.

    In other words, these conditions imply that this market is of the textbook type. Hence,
Proposition 3 can be interpreted as indicating that perceptions driven aggregate co-movement
will arise if the market for capital is well behaved and the labor market is segmented in the
short run. The reason why we obtain positive co-movement in consumption and investment
in this setup derives directly from the intra-temporal gains from trade induced by the labor
market segmentation. When Ω1 increases, consumption sector agents want to buy capital
from workers in the capital goods sector. With an upward sloping labor supply curve, the
capital goods sector workers will respond to this new demand by favoring a greater trade
flow between the two types of workers, which corresponds to an increase in economic activity.
It could be the case that both types of agents reduce their purchase of their own good to
offset these increased interpersonal transactions, but under the conditions of Proposition 3
this won’t happen. This is why positive perceptions about the future can cause a generalized
boom in the presence of explicit gains from trade, while such positive co-movement would
not be possible – as noted in Proposition 2 – if labor markets were homogeneous.
    We could at this point try to provide sufficient conditions for an increase in Ω1 to be as-
sociated with individual positive co-movement. Although it is rather easy to build examples
where this property is satisfied, we have not found any very insightful sufficient conditions,13
 13
      For example, if we want capital purchases for type 1 individuals to respond positively to an increase in


                                                      11
and accordingly we have not chosen to pursue this issue further.14

3.3     Some explicit dynamic examples
In this section we want to present two simple examples of economic environments where
increases in the perceived return to capital can cause a boom, while a decrease can cause a
bust. We have chosen examples that can be solved explicitly, as to best illustrate our results.
As is well known, it is difficult to get explicit solutions in dynamic general equilibrium
models and accordingly we must resort to highly simplified environments. We begin by an
overlapping generation model with complete depreciation, and complete sector specialization.
Then we present an infinitely lived agent setup with incomplete depreciation. A special case
of the second example will be later used to analyze monetary policy with sticky prices.

Example 1 : An overlapping generation model
Agents live for two periods, and have preferences given by

                                (Ctyi )1−σ1                (C oi )1−σ2
                                            + ν(1 − Lit ) + t+1        .
                                 1 − σ1                      1 − σ2

    In the first period of their life they can consume, supply labor and buy capital. Ctyi
represents the consumption of agent i when young at time t, and Ctoi represents the con-
sumption of the old of period t. In the second period they can consume the returns from
their capital. Capital is assumed to fully depreciate after one period. Agents of type 1 can
only produce consumption goods while agents of type 2 can only produce capital goods. We
will let Kti represent the capital bought by agent i at time t. Both labor and capital can be
used to produce consumption goods according to the production function Ct = At Kt + L1t .
The production of the capital good is given by Kt+1 = L2t . In period t agents receive a
perfect signal of At+1 , that is, Ω1t = At+1 . The continuation value function for this example
                                                      1−σ2
                            i
is therefore given by V (Kt+1   , Ω1t ) = (Ω1t K1−σ
                                                 t+1 )

                                          σ2 (1−σ1 )+σ1
    The solution to this example has P = Ω1t            ν             σ2
                                                                             , Cty1 = ν      1
                                                                                                    2
                                                                                                 , Kt+1 =ν      2   Ω1tσ2 ,

Kt+1  = (νP ) σ2 Ω1tσ2 and CtY 2 = ( Pν ) σ1 .
    From this solution, it can be verified that an expected increase in Ω1t will lead to positive
individual co-movement as long as σ1 < 1 and σ2 < 1. Note that σ1 < 1 and σ2 < 1 are
sufficient here for wages to have a positive effect on labor supply and for an expected increase
in Ω1t to cause a increase in the perceived return to capital.

      It should be noted that individual positive co-movement requires quite restrictive assumptions. For
example it generally requires, among others, that leisure enter linearly in the utility of the consumption
sector workers and that there be no decreasing returns to labor in the production of consumption goods.
Accordingly, we view individual positive co-movement as a rather knife edge possibility within a Walrasian
framework.

Example 2: A model with infinitely lived agents
Consider an environment where we have two infinitely lived agents. The labor of agents of
type 1 is valuable only in the production of consumption goods and his preferences are given
by
                                X∞
                                           1
                                   β j ln Ct+j + ν(1 − L1t+j ) .

                                   j=0

The second type of agent can only produce investment goods and his preferences are given
by
                          ∞

Capital depreciates at rate δ such that the aggregate capital stock satisfies Kt+1 = (1−δ)Kt +
It , where the production of capital is given by It = L22 . The production of the consumption
good is given by Ct = At Kt + L1t . Perfect substitutability between capital and labor allows
for an analytical solution.
     The return on capital, At , is assumed to be i.i.d., with mean zero and composed of
two independent components: At = t + st−N . The t component is assumed to be non-
predictable, while the second component st−N is assumed to be known to agents N periods
before it actually affects returns. Therefore the set of exogenous information relevant for
individuals when making predictions at time i is Ω1t = {st , . . . , st−N −1 }.
     In this setup much of the equilibrium outcome can be solved analytically. In particular,
the equilibrium will be characterized by the price of capital at time t be given by

                        ν                     1+γ
where µt is the marginal utility of consumption of type two agents. While we are not able
to provide a explicit expression for µt , it can be deduced that it is increasing with the signal
st . From the above equations we can see how the elements in Ω1t affect consumption and
investment. In particular, consider the dynamics induced when agents receive a positive

                                                     13
realization of st , that is, agents at time t receive a signal telling them that returns to capital
will likely be high in N periods. This immediately gives rise to an increase in investment,
as the payoff to investment has increased. Moreover, it leads to an increase in aggregate
consumption as the positive signal has increased the gains from trade between type 1 and
type 2 agents. Positive co-movement therefore arises as investment increases and workers in
the investment sector buy more consumption goods. Over time the effect of this signal builds
up as the perceived higher-than-normal return to capital becomes more salient. Eventually,
the period of high perceived return comes to an end – with or without the returns actually
being confirmed – and then the economy enters a recession as investment falls back to normal
and the economy liquidates its capital stock.
    As the marginal utility term µt in the above equations cannot be solved explicitly, it is of
interest to compare the solution with a case which can be entirely solved. This corresponds
to the situation where the type 2 agents are myopic (meaning that they only make static
consumption/leisure decisions). In this case, Pt , It and L2t all take the exact same form as
given above. All that changes is Ct and L1t , which are now given by

                                                     N −1
                                                                                   ! 1+γ

                                                                             ! 1+γ
                                                                                γ

                           ν                  j=0

Here, when type 2 agents are myopic, the qualitative dynamics induced by increases in the
perceived returns to capital are essentially the same as when type 2 agents optimize over
time. For this reason, we believe that the case where type 2 agents are myopic provides a
tractable example that can be used effectively to explore implications of specialized labor
markets, knowing that the qualitative properties are very close to the case where type 2
agents optimize fully over time. In a later section we will use this extended example where
type 2 agents are myopic to examine some implication of sticky prices.

3.4    Allowing for contingent claims
Our analysis may at first pass appear restrictive since it does not include financial claims
that agents trade among themselves. In particular, one may want to allow agents to trade in
a full set of state contingent claims markets, where the contingencies would be the different
possible realizations of the random variables in S. However, after closer inspection, we
can show that our analysis is not restrictive on this front, as such trades can be viewed
as being subsumed in the functions V i (·). To see this suppose, suppose that agents can
trade in contingent claims markets and therefore can enter a period with a portfolio of
contingent claims denoted {yni }N n=1 , where N is the number of potential realization of S, and
 i
yn represents the number of claims to be paid in state n held by agent i . The problem facing
the agent would then correspond to
                                                      h                    i
                                        i      i          i  i N
                          max      U (C , 1 − L ) + E β V ({yn }n=1 ; S)/Ω

                                                              14

                                                    n

where pn are the prices of contingent claims and Ve i ({yni }N n=1 ; S) represents the value of
entering a period with the portfolio {yni }N
                                           n=1 when the state is S. Now consider the following
sequence of budget constraints

                                         C i + pK i = wi Li ,
                                          X            X
                                              pn yni =    pn rn K i ,
                                           n                      n

where rn are the returns on capital in the different states. In this sequence of budget
constraints, an individual would first face a budget constraint where he decides how much
capital to buy and then uses the capital to purchase continent claims. The important aspect
to notice is thatPthis sequence of budget P   constraints is actually equivalent to the budget
constraint C + n pn yn = w L if pK = n pn rn K i . But this last condition is assured by
             i           i     i i      i

arbitrage. Hence, we can view the problem facing an agent in the contingent claims setup
as one where the agent first chooses C i , K i and Li , and then chooses {yni }N
                                                                               n=1 . The problem
facing the agent initially can therefore be rewritten as

                            max U (C i , 1 − Li ) + V (K i ; Ω, {Pn }N
                                                                     n=1 )
                          C i ,Li ,K i


subject to
                                                C i + pK i = wi Li ,
                         
where V K i ; Ω, {Pn }N
                      n=1 is now the value function associated with
                                              h                               i
                      i         N                  i   i N
                 V (K ; Ω, {Pn }n=1 ) = max E β V ({yn }n=1 ; S1 , S2 )/Ω, S1
                                                 e
                                                  i }N
                                                {yn  n=1

                                            n                 n

Given this two step interpretation, the problem facing the agent when deciding C i , K i and Li
is now almost identical to what we had in the previous section with the exception that now
the state contingent prices Pn N n=1 are added arguments in the value function. However, in
equilibrium the state contingent prices themselves will be a function of Ω and therefore they
can be replaced in the value function of the form V (K i ; Ω, Pn N
                                                                 n=1 ), to give us back a value
function of the form V (K i ; Ω). Accordingly, our Propositions 1 to 3 can be seen as applying
equally well to a situation where agents have access to contingent claims on the realizations
of S or when they do not. The difference between the two cases will affect the shape of
the relevant value function, but that does not impinge on the propositions. Moreover, it is
important to note that in this argument we have not placed any non-negativity constraint
on K as allowing for such a possibility is necessary for the equivalence result.

3.5    Ex-ante markets on perceptions Ω1
We have shown that perception driven booms and busts (e.g. based either on hard informa-
tion, rumor or fad) can arise quite naturally in environments where there are explicit gains
from trade between individuals because of short run labor market specialization. Moreover
we have shown that perception driven fluctuations can arise even in situation where agents
can share risk regarding the outcomes on which they make perceptions. However, we have
not yet examined what would happen if we allowed people to insure themselves against
changes in perceptions themselves. While we view the existence of a full set of such markets
somewhat unlikely, in this section we will discuss how our analysis is modified if we allow
agents to meet before the realization of Ω1 and trade contingent claims markets written on
the realizations of the perceptions themselves. If we assume that Ω1 can take on M val-
ues (m = 1, .., M ), and the probability of each of these outcomes is given by Πm , then the
problem facing agent i in the case where ex-ante markets contingent on Ω1 are available is

ization of Ω1 is Ω1m , and Pmc is the price of this contingent claim.
    For this case, we have results which complement those in Propositions 1 to 3, that is,
Proposition 4 When agents are allowed to trade contingent claims written on the realiza-
tion of Ω1 , then positive co-movement is not possible if either labor is homogeneous or if
labor specialized and the preferences U (C, 1 − L) are separable.
    Proposition 4 indicates that in the presence of ex-ante claims on Ω1 , it is much more
difficult to generate positive co-movement driven by changes in perception even in the case
where agents are specialized, as it requires that preferences be non-separable. Accordingly,
we take Proposition 3 and 4 as indicating that positive co-movement driven by perception can
arise quite easily when agents are specialized and they can’t diversify all the risk associated
with changes in perceptions about the future. However such positive co-movement is much
less likely to arise if ex-ante markets for Ω1 exist. In particular, when agents are specialized
and preferences are separable, the insurance provided by ex-ante markets written on Ω1
results in the consumption of both agents becoming independent of the realization of Ω1 ,
and therefore positive co-movement is not possible.


4     Positive policy analysis
In section 3 we established that introducing explicit intra-temporal gains from trade between
individuals (due to labor market segmentation) in a macroeconomic model offers an environ-
ment where changes in perceptions about the future can cause business fluctuations under

                                                        16
seemingly reasonable conditions. In this section we want to explore whether such a frame-
work also provides new insight into fiscal and monetary issues. We begin by exploring the
link between labor market specialization and the effects of fiscal policy within a Walrasian
framework. Then we will explore a sticky price model with explicit gains from trade which
we present as a simple extension of the baseline New Keynesian model.

4.1     Fiscal policy
4.1.1   Introducing a government
We continue to work here with the setup of Section 2 where we have two types of indivi-
duals who can differ in terms both of their preferences (represented by U i (C i , 1 − Li ) and
V i (K i ; Ω)) and in terms of value of their labor in the production of the two different goods.
In this environment, we want to explore the effect of temporary changes in government
spending. To keep the discussion as simple as possible, we choose to look at fiscal policies
which are composed only of current government expenditures paid by current taxes. This
clearly makes the policy temporary and will allow us to side step any issues related to future
expectations of policy and of non-Ricardian equivalence. A fiscal policy will therefore be
composed of current expenditure by the government in terms of consumption goods, GC , an
expenditure in terms of capital goods, GK , a lump sum tax on type 1 individuals, T 1 , and
a lump sum tax on type 2 individuals, T 2 . The balanced budget requirement imposes:

                                     GC + pGK = T 1 + T 2 .

We will assume that type 1 is taxed a proportion α of total expenditure, that is T 1 =
α(GC + GK ), with the remaining fraction corresponding to the tax on type 2 individuals.
A common question that arises about fiscal policy is whether and under what conditions
(if any) can a temporary increase in government spending create a multiplier effect, in
the sense that the total effect of a government spending increase of one dollar leads to an
effect on aggregate output of more than one dollar. It is well known that in a Walrasian
setting temporary increases in government spending generally lead to a multiplier that is
less than one as the new expenditures tend to crowd out expenditures by households on
either investment or consumption purchases. In this subsection we want to examine whether
the introduction of explicit gains from trade between individuals changes such results. To
present our results as clearly as possible, and to help shed new light on the issue, it is helpful
to focus on government expenditures that are directed only at one sector. To this end, let us
consider a fiscal policy which is directed at purchasing investment goods, where these goods
are either wasted or enter separately into households’ preferences.
    To understand if a change in GK can have a multiplier greater than one it is helpful to
first break down the question into two simpler elements: (1) Can an increase government
purchases of capital goods cause private agents to buy more capital goods, if so we would
call this an amplification effect, and (2) can an increase in government purchases of capital
goods cause private agents to consume more consumption goods, if so we would call this a
spillover effect. The following propositions address these issues.



                                               17
Proposition 5 If the preferences of agents are identical and their labor is perfectly sub-
stitutable (i.e. a representative agent setup), then an increase in government purchases of
capital goods cannot lead to either an increase in private purchase of either capital goods (no
amplification effect) or consumption goods (no spillover effect). Hence government purchases
of investment goods cannot in this case create positive aggregate co-movement nor create a
multiplier greater than one.

    Proposition 5 echoes previous results regarding the crowding out effects of government
spending in a Walrasian setting.15 As stated in the Proposition, when there is no explicit
gains from trade between individuals (i.e. a representative agent setup), an increase in
public spending tends to crowd-out private expenditures. In effect, in our setup, even if the
public purchase is directed only at capital goods it tends to crowd out (at least weakly)
private expenditures on both consumption and capital goods. This result is rather intuitive.
Within a representative agent, the government purchase cannot increase the desire to trade
as one trades only with oneself, and any trades that are possible after the purchase by
the government were also possible before and therefore there is no reason to expect either
amplification or positive spill-over. However, the same logic does not follow once there is
more than one type of individual. If agents differ in their sector of employment, then the
government purchase of capital goods transfers income to capital goods producers which will
generally lead them to buy more consumptions goods. In fact, in such a case the government
action is changing the gains from trade between the different types of workers; it is favoring
trade from the producer of consumption goods – who need income to pay taxes– toward the
producers of capital goods – which have increased net revenues. While the precise outcomes
can vary, Proposition 6 indicates that given the the conditions under which we obtained
perception driven fluctuations in Section 3, we find that government expenditures can create
spillovers and positive aggregate co-movement.

Proposition 6 If the conditions of Proposition 3 are met, then an increase in government
purchases of capital goods will lead to an increase in private purchases of consumption goods
(a spillover effect), and create positive co-movement. However, it will not increase the private
purchase of capital goods (no amplification effect).

    Recall that the conditions stated in Proposition 3 implied an upward sloping aggregate
capital supply curve and a downward sloping capital demand curve. In such a case, an
increase in government purchases of capital goods tends to shift out the aggregate demand
for capital, increasing the aggregate quantity purchased and increasing the price of capital.
Individual demand curves for capital tend to shift in because of the tax increases. Hence
we can see why there is no amplification effect as the equilibrium price of capital increases
and agents have downward sloping demand curves. However, through this process agents
in the capital sector are getting higher income which leads them to want to consume more.
This is where the gains from trade arise. The producers of consumptions goods are willing
to trade with the producers of capital goods as the added income will help them pay taxes.
Could it be the case that the income effect on the producers of capital is great enough to
 15
    See for example Baxter and King [1993], Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Fisher [2004] and Ramey and
Shapiro [1998].


                                               18
lead such producers to actually substantially increase their purchase of capital and create
amplification? Under the assumptions of Proposition 6 this cannot happen since aggregate
capital demand is downward sloping.
    Proposition 5 and 6 provide insight to how allowing for explicit gains from trade between
individuals can change the qualitative effects of fiscal policy. In particular, it is interesting
to note that the framework has the potential to explain why consumption may increase fol-
lowing an increase in government purchases, as has been found empirically by Blanchard and
Perotti [2002], Fatas and Mihov [2001] and Galı́, López-Salido, and Vallés [2007]. However,
Proposition 6 does not address the issue of whether government spending can create multi-
pliers greater than one. In the case of purchases of investment goods, this would happen if
the spillover effect on consumption goods was large enough and that the crowding out effect
on private investment is not to important. While getting multiplier effects greater than one
in our setting is not difficult, it does depend on many issues. Since we have not found any
insightful general conditions that clarify when a multiplier greater or smaller than one may
arise, we turn to now to illustrating the possibilities and difficulties using simple examples.

4.1.2    Illustrating how taxing decisions affect the size of a government purchase
         multiplier
This section will illustrate that the size of a government spending multiplier depends critically
on whether the spending package and taxes are set to create gains from trade or not. For
example, as will be shown, government spending that is associated with sectoral taxes which
are proportional to the sectoral expenditures creates no multiplier effect (multiplier equals
one at best). What is important for government spending to have a multiplier effect is that
it leads to differential income effects across agents, and it is these income effects that create
gains from trade. Interestingly, this analysis helps shed light on why investment may be
seen as having a multiplier while government spending may not. The reason being that
investment driven by perception is an increase in demand that is not balanced in terms of its
income effects and hence creates gains from trade. Government policy can try to replicate
such an effect but it needs to not offset sectoral expenditure with equivalent sectoral taxes.
     To see this mechanism, consider the same two period environment as we have been
focusing upon, that is, there are two types of agents with preferences

                                 U i (C i , Li ) = ln C i + φ(1 − li ),
                                     V i (K i ) = ln K i ,

where agent 2 produces capital (one-to-one), and agent 1 produces the consumption good
(one-to-one). The price of consumption is normalized to 1, and P represents the relative
price of the investment good.
    Let us assume that government spending takes the form of an expenditure of 1 (in units
of the numeraire) divided between investment goods and consumption goods. Let α be the
expenditure on investment goods (so that the real amount of investment purchased will be
α
P
  ), and 1 − α the expenditure on consumptions goods.16 Total taxes need to be equal to 1,
  16
    The policy could alternatively be specified in terms of real purchases of both goods. This slightly
complicates the algebra but provides very similar insights.


                                                  19
so let us denote by β the lump sum tax imposed to the investment sector agent, while 1 − β
is the lump sum taxes imposed on the agent in the consumption good sector.
    The budget constraint of agent 2 is C 2 + P K 2 = P L2 − β, the first order conditions can
be expressed as
                                            P

                                   P (L − K 2 ) − β

The budget constraint of agent 1 is C 1 + P K 1 = L1 − (1 − β), the first order conditions can
be expressed as
                                           1

                               (L − P K ) − (1 − β)
                                                P              1
                                                             = 1.

                                           − P K ) − (1 − β)  K
The market clearing condition for the capital market is
                                                               α
                                           L2 = K 1 + K 2 +      .
                                                               P
    These five equations17 determine {L1 , L2 , K 1 , K 2 , P } as a function of the government
policy α and β.
    In the case of no government spending, the equilibrium allocations are given by L1 =
L2 = φ2 , P = 1, K 1 = K 2 = φ1 . Therefore, GDP in consumption units is equal to C +pK = φ4
    Assume now that the government spends a total of one (in units on consumption) on
consumption and investment goods. In such a case, it can be verified that GDP in consump-
tion units is equal to φ4 + 1 + 2(α − β), so the multiplier is 1 + 2(α − β). If α = β then the
multiplier is simply 1. The multiplier is maximized when all the purchases are targeted at
the investment sector (α = 1), and no taxes are paid in the investment sector (β = 0). This
illustrates that government spending can have a greater effect when sectoral spending is not
offset by proportional sectoral taxes.18

4.1.3    Introducing an explicit government sector to illustrate how a large mul-
         tiplier can arise
In this second example we want to to illustrate a case where government purchases correspond
to the hiring of a particular set of workers, and how this leads to a multiplier of exactly two.
To this end, we take the same setup as above but we add one more type of agent. Agent 3 has
the same preferences as the others – i.e. ln(C 3 ) + ν(1 − L3 ) + ln K 3 , with budget constraint
C 3 + P K 3 = w3 L3 . Agents of type 3 can only be hired by the government and so their
  17
      This system can be quickly reduced to a system in 3 equations when noting that K 2 = φ1 , P K 1 = φ1 ,
                                              P                    1                   2   1     2   α
hence the three relevant equations are P (L2 −K 2 )−β = φ, (L1 −P K 1 )−(1−β) = φ and L = K + K + P .
  18
      It may be more appropriate to calculate post spending GDP in baseline prices (– i.e., L1 + L2 instead
of P L2 + L1 ). In this case, GDP after spending is φ4 + 1 + (α−β)(2−βφ)
                                                                1+φ(α−β) , which again implies a multiplier of
1 if α equals β (sectoral balancing of expenditures and taxes).


                                                     20
labor income corresponds to government expenditure: w3 L3 = G, where G is government
spending. We assume for simplicity that G is either useless, or enters utility in a separable
manner, so its direct effect on decisions can be disregarded. We set taxes to be lump sum and
equal on both agent 1 and 2. This model can be solved explicitly, and gives a multiplier of
exactly two following an increase in government spending. What happens is that both agent
1 and 2 keep consuming and investing as before, but both work more to supply consumption
goods and investment goods to agent 3 who is the beneficiary of government spending.
   The equilibrium conditions in this case are:
                                         P
                                                     G

                                  (L1   − P K 1) −   2

                                                       = ν,
                                        w 3 L3 − P K 3
                                                   Pν     1

                                                       =    .
                                                   w     K3
    In this model, the solution takes the following form: P = 1 (hence the price of investment
is not affected by government spending), K 3 = G2 , K 2 = ν1 , K 1 = ν1 and therefore K = L2 =
G
 2
   + ν2 , C 1 = C 2 = ν1 , C 3 = G2 and L1 = ν2 + G2 = C
    Therefore an increase in G increases aggregate consumption, investment and employment.
Let us define GDP as C + P K + G. We therefore have GDP = ν4 + 2G. The multiplier of
exactly 2 derived here is interesting as it arises from the fact that the government expenditure
creates income for type 3 individuals, which they use to buy goods from other agents. As
they use all their increased income to buy either consumption goods or investment goods,
this leads to an increase of both aggregate consumption and investment of the same amount
as the original outlay by the government. The other agents are willing to supply such goods
to type 3 agents since they need the extra revenue to pay taxes. It is in this sense that the
government intervention is increasing the gains from trade between type 3 individuals and
the others.

4.2    Sticky price, inflation and monetary policy
Up to now we have provided examples of how labor market segmentation – which gives
rise to gains from trade between individuals – can bring insights about the functioning of
the macroeconomy when prices adjust to to their Walrasian levels. In this section we want
to illustrate how introducing explicit gains from trade into a standard sticky price model
can also alter conventional wisdom regarding the determination of inflation and the role of
monetary policy in responding to “demand” shocks. In particular, we want to contrast the
functioning of a baseline New Keynesian model where there is a representative agent to one

                                               21
that we augment to include gains from trade between individuals. The baseline model we
have in mind is the textbook example of Galı́ [2008].

4.2.1     A standard New Keynesian model
Consider en environment with one representative agent who consumes an aggregate con-
sumption good that is a basket of monopolistically produced consumption goods indexed by
j:                                                    ε
                                       Z 1         ε−1
                                             ε−1
                                  ct =      cjt dj
                                               ε
                                                         .
                                                   0

This agent is infinitely lived and has preferences over consumption and leisure given by
                                 X
                                     β t (ln(cct ) + Φ(1 − `Ct )) ,

with 1 > β > 0 and Φ > 0.
   Each monopoly j produces a variety of consumption good according to the following
constant return to scale technology:

                                               Cjt = At Lj t,

where At is a technological shock. Prices are sticky and we assume Calvo price setting: each
consumption firm may reset its price with probability 1 − θ in each period, θ ∈ [0, 1].
Finally, there is a central bank that sets the nominal interest rate following a Taylor rule.
     In the flexible price allocations, labor is constant, so that natural output is given by
   n    bt and the natural real interest rate, denoted ρb, satisfies ρbtn = Et A
                                                                               bt+1 − A
ybt = A                                                                               bt (where
hats denote log deviations from the steady state).19 In the sticky price model, we define the
output gap yet as the deviation of output from the natural level ybt − ybtn . The equilibrium
allocations are given by a dynamic IS equation, a New Keynesian Phillips curve and Taylor
rule (that relates the nominal interest rate to output gap and inflation):
                           
                            yet = − (bıt − Et πbt+1 − ρbtn ) + Et yet+1 ,
                               π
                               bt = βEt π bt+1 + λbyt ,
                               +      Taylor rule,
                           

where i is the nominal interest rate, π the rate of inflation and where where λ is a function
of the model parameters.
    What happens in this environment if agents expect At+1 to be high? This increases the
demand for current consumption through the expectation of future income. If the Taylor rule
is such that it does not immediately increase interest rates enough to fully offset the increased
demand, this will lead to inflation. In particular, let us focus on the New Keynesian Phillips
curve. The increased expectation of At+1 does not directly enter into this curve, and therefore
if a higher expectation for this variable leads to an increase in output it will necessarily place
upward pressure on inflation as the natural level of output is not affected by the more
optimistic expectation that increases the demand for consumption goods. Accordingly, it is

optimal in such a setting for the monetary authorities to completely offset such a demand
shock by increasing interest rates sufficiently to leave output unaffected. In contrast, if
the shock was to At , which would be referred to a supply shock as it changes the current
capacity of the economy to produce, it would be reasonable to accommodate the shock and
let output increase while simultaneously maintaining stable inflation. This set up provides a
nice illustration of the textbook prescription that in order to keep stable inflation, monetary
authorities need to strongly counteract demand shock but need to accommodate supply
shocks. Moreover in this framework, if the economy goes into recession (expansion) due to
a fall (increase) in demand – as opposed to a reduction in supply capacity – this should
put substantial downward (upward) pressure on prices. We now want to illustrate how such
results change when we add another agent into this economy such that there are now gains
from trade between individuals.

4.2.2      Adding gains from trade
Let us consider the same simple New Keynesian setting which we now augment to include
explicit gains from trade between individuals. Some agents will produce the consumption
good and some the investment good. Although we allow for capital accumulation and agents
heterogeneity, we will make functional form assumptions to preserve tractability of the model.
When the number of investment good workers is driven to zero, the model will converge to
the simple New Keynesian model presented above.
    The economy is populated of nC consumption good workers and nX investment good
workers. All agents consume an aggregate consumption good, that is a basket of monopolis-
tically produced consumption goods indexed by j. Denoting cCt and cXt the consumption of
a representative consumption good worker and of a representative investment good worker,
we have:
                                          Z 1             ε

   Each monopoly j produces a variety of consumption good according to the following
constant return to scale technology:

                                     Cjt = Θt Kjt + At LCt .

Capital and labor are perfectly substitutable in the production of consumption good varieties,
which allows for an easier analytical solution. Θt is a capital specific stochastic technological
shock and At a labor specific one. The investment good is produced by a representative
competitive firm, with labor only, and according to the constant return to scale technology:

                                          Xt = BLXt .

Capital accumulates according to the following law of motion, with δ ∈ [0, 1]:

                                    Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + Xt .

In this section, we will assume that there is full depreciation (δ = 1). In appendix (B), we
present the equations for the more general case. As before, there is a monopoly for each
variety of the consumption good, while there are competitive markets in labor, investment
good, bond and money. Money remains the numéraire. Total real output (or real GDP) is
measured in units of consumption and is defined as
                                                    Rt
                                       Yt = C t +      Xt ,
                                                    Pt
where Pt is the consumption goods price index and Rt is the price of the investment good.
We assume Calvo price setting. In order to embed the standard model of Galı́ as a special
case of our model when nX = 0, we assume that prices are sticky in the consumption good
sector only. Each consumption firm may reset its price with probability 1 − θ, θ ∈ [0, 1].
In the investment good sector, we maintain the assumption of flexible prices.
    Interestingly the log linear approximation for this extended model can be written in a
form very similar to the baseline model, that is, it can be written as
                         
                          yet = −ζ (bıt − Et πbt+1 − ρbtn ) + Et yet+1 ,
                             π
                             bt = βEt π bt+1 + λζ −1 yet ,
                             +      Taylor rule,
                         

where λ and ζ are functions of the model parameters. In the baseline New Keynesian model,
the natural rate of output was given by ybtn = A   bt , and therefore only varied if At varied.
However, in our extended model, the natural or non-inflationary level of output is given by
                                         h              i
                     ybtn = φ2 At + φ1 Et Θb t+1 − A
                                                   bt+1 = φ2 At + φ1 Ωb t,
               h             i
where Ω
      b t = Et Θ b t+1 − A
                         bt+1 captures a change in expectations that increases the relative
productivity of capital. We can therefore write the Phillips curve alternatively as:
                                                                    
                                             −1
                          π
                          bt = βEt π
                                   bt+1 + λζ      ybt − φ2 At − φ1 Ωt .
                                                                   b                 (P C)

                                               24
    Now let us consider how this economy reacts to the belief that Θ  b t+1 − A
                                                                              bt+1 will be high
as captured by a high value of Ωt . Such a change in perception will induce consumption
workers to want to by capital as its return is expected to be high, which will lead them to
want to increase their trade with investment workers. It will also induce investment workers
to want to buy more capital, and induce them to buy more consumption goods as they feel
richer. Following the standard nomenclature, this would appear as a type of demand shock.
However, this extended economy does not react to this type of demand shock in the same way
that the baseline model does. As can be seen in equation (P C), an increase in output driven
by such a change in perception will not necessarily place upward pressure on prices as the
natural or non-inflation rate of output has also changed. In (P C) the perception about Ωt
itself enters the Phillips curve, that is, the change in perception makes the output-inflation
trade-off better. Hence a monetary authority who would like to stabilize prices would not
want to counteract such a demand shock, but instead would like to accommodate it.
    In such a framework, if an economy found itself in a recession due to a negative change
in perception about the future returns to capital, this would not necessarily place downward
pressure on prices. Similarly, if an economy became widely optimistic about the future
returns to current investment, this could cause a demand driven boom which could be
completely compatible with stable inflation. Hence, one can see that a model with explicit
gains from trade can behave quite differently, and lead to quite different policy advice, than
a model based on a representative agent framework.
    Why is it that the two models give such conflicting views about the effects of demand
shock on inflation? Actually, the two models are not very different in their implications once
the right wording is used. The main lesson from New Keynesian models in terms of inflation is
that inflation is created by output movements which depart from the Walrasian counterpart.
This lesson remains true in our slightly extended model. What is different in our framework
is that perceptions affect the Walrasian equilibrium volumes of trade due to the induced gains
from trade between agents. What one should take away from this example is that distinction
between demand and supply shocks, which has a long history in macroeconomics, is not a
very useful way to organize one’s discussion when agents have incentive to trade between
themselves.21 In other words, what should be viewed as causing inflation is deviation of
output from the mutually desirable volume of trade between individuals, knowing that this
equilibrium volume of trade is likely to be as sensitive to current changes in supply capacity
as it is of perceptions about the future.

4.2.3    An interpretation of the recent cycles
Is there any reason to believe that the insight presented above regarding the effects perception
driven fluctuations on inflation are relevant for current economic analysis? We believe so.
Casual evidence to support this claim is given by Figure 2. The Figure displays, for the
United States, HP cycles for hours worked and average labor productivity, together with the
level of core inflation and investment-output ratio. If we focus exclusively on the last three
  21
    The idea that the demand-supply distinction used in many macroeconomic discussions may not be very
meaningful has been emphasized in many contexts over the years. Our contribution here is to present a
simple, potentially relevant and very transparent example where the distinction is inappropriaten and likely
to mislead policy.


                                                    25
cycles (the last 30 years), we can see how conventional logic has a hard time explaining these
episodes. We can see that the pattern of hours is very similar across the three cycles. The
first well know fact about this period is that this set of boom bust cycles in hours happens
with very little change in inflation (although inflation is still slightly procyclical over the
period, it is barely moving). Using traditional logic, it would appear doubtful that these
cycles can be caused by changes in aggregate demand as inflation would be expected to rise as
a natural byproduct of a demand driven cycle. At the same time, it is interesting to note that
labor productivity and employment have been essentially uncorrelated over the period. This
suggests that these cycles were not driven by cyclically high level of productivity. Finally, we
can see from the investment to output ratio series that cycles are essentially large booms and
bust in investment. The question then arises what has caused these cycles if they are neither
driven by neither technological supply shocks nor demand surprises. One easy interpretation
of these cycles is that they represent cycles driven primarily by the expectation that current
investment will have a high return. The analysis of this paper provides a simple mechanism
which can explain the resulting boom-bust cycle while simultaneously being consistent with
stable inflation. For the same reasons that long and protracted periods of aggregate booms
can be non-inflationary, in our framework recessions are not necessarily creating strong
deflationary pressures which is also a feature of the period.


5      Discussion and evidence
5.1     Discussion of normative issues
In our discussion of policy, we have shown how and under what conditions specialized labor
markets can (1) explain why a monetary authority that accommodates demand driven booms
may not be stimulating inflation, and (2) explain how government spending in one sector can
spillover positively to other sectors and thereby create increased consumption and generalized
booms. However, these are positive implications. We have not discussed optimal policy. The
first question to focus upon when addressing optimal policy is identify what imperfection is
the policy trying to counter. In our setup, there is one sense in which markets are imperfect
and it is due to the lack of complete markets to insure against changes in perception. The
evidence on consumption presented in the next section will provide support to the notion
that agents do not have access to a sufficient array of contingent claims to protect themselves
fully from sectoral shocks. In such a case government policy may aim to help the economy
replicate as best as possible the type of outcome that would arise with complete markets
to share perception risk. To see whats such a policy response may look like, we return
to our two agent setup where the exogenous disturbance is a change in perception about
future returns to capital. While these perceptions could be erroneous, we will treat that
here as being shared by the policy makers and discuss only how best to respond given the
perception.22
    Let us consider the environment where we have two types of agents i = 1, 2 of mass 1,
  22
     If the policy makers think the perceptions are erroneous, this would provide a different reason for policy
intervention. While this is an interesting and potentially relevant issue, we do not pursue this issue here.

                                   U i (C 1 ) + ν(1 − Li ) + V i (K i , Ω1 ),

with U1i > 0, U11 i
                      < 0 and V12i > 0. Agent 1 can only produce consumption goods, and
agent 2 can only produce investment goods. Production technology is one-to-one in both
sectors. The variable governing perceptions, Ω1 , can take on two values, Ω̄ > Ω, where the
probability of it taking on the value Ω̄ is q.
    How can fiscal policy be used in such an environment to an support an ex-ante Pareto
optimal outcome? What is needed is that policy be chosen so that marginal utility for each
agent is equalized across states. This can be done quite simply with a tax transfer scheme
between individuals, which satisfies budget balance and it can in addition be chosen to be
fair in the sense of zero expected transfers between the parties.23 In particular, if we denote
by T (Ω̄) the tax imposed on type 2 agents in the optimistic state, then the fair transfer
received in the pessimistic state can be written as 1−q q
                                                           T (Ω̄). Accordingly, in such a case the
transfer to type 1 in the optimistic state is T (Ω̄), and the tax in the pessimistic state is given
by 1−q
     q
        T (Ω̄). The value for T (Ω̄) that implements a Pareto optimum can be found by solving
the Walrasian equilibrium for the two states and imposing the conditions that

                                           K 1 (Ω̄) + K 2 (Ω̄) = L2 (Ω̄),

The resulting policy will be one that taxes workers in the capital good sector when agents are
optimistic, and transfers fund to them when agents are pessimistic. These transfers induce
full consumption smoothing for workers in the capital sector and thereby stabilize the price
of capital. It should be noted that such an intervention will tend to increase the volatility of
capital purchases, as well as employment in the capital goods sector, as optimal intervention
does not require stabilizing investment. If fact, taking as given the changing perceptions of
the future return to capital, it is optimal to have investment fluctuate significantly in response
to these changes.24 It is worth noting that unemployment insurance in many countries plays
  23
     The fair aspect is not a requirement for a Pareto optimum, it is simply a way of selecting one allocation
in the set of Pareto optima.

     If we don’t assume separable or quasi linear preferences, the analysis is not much changed. An ex-ante
Pareto optimum can be obtained by simply setting a tax transfer scheme that keeps the marginal utility of
type 2 equal across the two states, that is

a role somewhat similar to the optimal policy described here. Unemployment insurance tends
to dis-proportionally transfer income to workers in capital good sectors when the economy is
doing badly. Such transfers are generally based on past wages and therefore will tend to keep
up current wages and the price of capital in recessions. This will likely amplify employment
movements in the capital good sector, but this is precisely what is optimal when consumption
is stabilized.25

5.2     Evidence of labor market segmentation and imperfect insur-
        ance
Gains from trade between individuals in the goods markets arise when agents don’t produce
the same goods. If agents can always allocate their time without frictions between different
sectors of production then there would be no explicit gains from trade in these markets.
Even if labor supply is lumpy, as long as agents can move freely between sectors their labor
income should not differ depending on the sector they happened to have chosen at a point
in time.
    In this section we want to briefly examine the extent to which individual-level labor
income varies over the cycle depending on what sector one tends to be associated with at
the beginning of a period.
    To look at this issue, we used data from the PSID over the period 1968-2007. The
PSID interviews families during the March-April period26 and asks them questions about
their income over the previous calendar year. They also report, among others, information
related to age, educational attainment and sector of employment. These data were collected
yearly between 1968-1997, and then bi-annually since 1999.
    We are interested in examining whether the growth in labor income of the head of house-
hold was systematically related to the aggregate performance of the sector (industry) to
which the head was attached at the beginning of the period. More precisely, our dependent
variable is the growth (log-difference) in the labor income of head of household over either a
two year period or a one year period. When looking at one year rates, we can use data only
from 1969 up to 1997.27 When using two year growth rates, we use non-overlapping periods
from 1969-2007.
    Our main regressor is the growth rate of either the industry level wage bill or employment
rate associated with the head’s sector of employment at the time of the interview. These
national level variables were taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National
Income and Product Account (NIPA) Tables.28 29
  25
     One of the aspects we find interesting about adopting an approach with explicit gains from trade is
that it simultaneously provides insight into why optimism and pessimism may be at the center of business
cycle fluctuations, and also provide a explanation to why many governments try to counter such cycles by
use of transfer programs and other automatic stabilizers.
  26
     In most cases, although some interviews also occur during other months.
  27
     We cannot use 1968 because we do not have aggregate data for that year.
  28
     Specifically, Section 6, Table 6.3: Wage and Salary Accruals by Industry, and Table 6.5: Full-Time
Equivalent Employees by Industry.
  29
     For the correspondence used to match the industry codes in the NIPA Tables (which are SIC and
NAICS) and the ones in the PSID (which are Census Codes), see Table C.1.



                                                  29
    The other regressors we include in the specification are a full set of year dummies, a full
set of age dummies, a control for the highest level of educational attainment, dummies for the
sector of employment, and interactions between age-time, education-age and education-time.
The coefficients on these later variables are not reported in the table.
    In a second set of regressions, we use as the dependent variable the growth rate (log-
difference) in the household’s total food consumption, and relate this, again to the industry-
level growth rates of either the wage bill or the employment rate of the industry the household
head works in at the time of the interview. Total food consumption is constructed as the
sum of expenditures on food at home and food out.30 Food consumption data is missing for
1973, 1988, 1989. There was also a change in the wording of the questions in 1994, so we
do not calculate any growth rates that overlap this period. Our sample is chosen so that we
cover the same years and a similar sample when looking at either the behavior of income or
consumption.31 32
    Column 1 of Table 1 reports results associated with regressing the growth over two years
in individual level labor income on the set of individual level controls noted above and on the
growth in national level employment for the sector with which the individual was associated
at the beginning of the period. National level growth in employment is calculated over the
same period as growth in individual level income. Since the specification also includes a
set of time dummies, the estimate of the effect of sectoral level growth in employment on
individual level income is identified off the cross-sectional variation where we are comparing
the growth rate in labor income at a point in time between individuals who happen to
be in different sectors of employment at the time of the interview. If labor markets were
completely integrated, and given we are controlling for common time effects, then individual
level outcomes should not be systematically related to aggregate outcomes for any particular
sectors.
    In Column 1 individuals are classified into three broad sectors: the government sector,
the capital goods sector defined as manufacturing and construction, and a residual sector
which captures all other sectors including the main product units for current consumption
goods.33 The effect of changes in aggregate employment growth on individual level income
is estimated to be close to .5. Recall that an individual is linked to a sector by his beginning
of period classification. This coefficient suggests that when comparing two individuals that
were initially attached to two different sectors, the individual initially attached to the sector
where aggregate employment grew by an extra 1% over two years saw his labor income
grow by an additional .5%. This effect is quite sizable, suggesting that individuals are not
sufficiently mobile between sectors to constantly induce equivalent returns across sectors.
    In Column 2 of the table we replace as regressor aggregate employment growth in the
  30
     We also add expenditure on food delivered, when available.
  31
      This restricts the sample years to those in which 2-year growth rates in food consumption data is
available, so the years included are 1969, 1975-1985, 1991, and 1995-2005.
  32
     For consistency, when using the growth in labor income as the dependent variable, we also examine
results when using all years available as opposed to using only the years for which consumption data is
available as well. Results are not significantly different. We also used the trimming criteria that consumption
growth could not increase or decrease by more than 100% over a two year period.
  33
      Individuals that did not declare an industry because of unemployment status were included in the
residual category.



                                                      30
sector by growth in the wage bill in the sector. This change in the indicator for sectoral
growth gives an almost identical result, suggesting that changes in the wage bill are domi-
nated by changes in employment, not changes in average wages. As we generally found that
these two aggregate indicators gave similar results, we will focus exclusively on the effects
of the aggregate employment growth variable in the remaining results. In Column 3, we
drop observations where individuals were linked to the government sector. This again does
not change significantly the estimate of the effect of sectoral growth on individual income
growth. In Column 4, we take a slightly more detailed view of sectors by linking individ-
uals to 10 different sectors i.e. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; Mining; Construction;
Manufacturing; Transportation, Communication and Public Utilities; Wholesale Trade; Re-
tail Trade; Finance, Insurance and Real Estate; Services; and Government.34 Again, this
changes very little the main estimated coefficient.35 As individuals with different levels of
educational attainment had quite distinct labor market outcomes over the period we cover,
in Column 5 we re-estimate the specification of Column 4 focusing only on individuals with
an educational attainment of high school or less. Results for more highly educated individ-
uals are similar but slightly less precise. Controlling for education in this alternative way
also does not change significantly our results suggesting that the results are unlikely to be
driven simply by some compositional effect across education groups.
    In Columns 6, 7 and 8 of Table 1 we report results based on one year intervals instead
of two year intervals. As the PSID only collected yearly observations until 1997, these
results cover only the period up to 1997.36 In Column (6) we report results for the 3 sector
specification, Column 7 corresponds to the 2 sector specification as was the case in Column 3,
and finally Column 8 reports results for the 10 sector specification. Somewhat surprisingly,
the results for the one year specification are very similar in magnitude to those observed in
the 2-year specification, suggesting that the segmentation likely lasts more than a year.
    The results from Table 1 provide support to the notion that, at least at frequencies
relevant for business cycle analysis, labor markets across sectors appear segmented. In
particular, these results suggest that the mobility across sectors is not sufficient to equate
the returns to labor between individuals initially attached to different sectors. While such a
segmentation of the labor markets is a necessary condition underlying our results regarding
how changes in perception can cause positive aggregate co-movement, it is also necessary
that such sectoral effects translate themselves at least in part to differences in consumption
behavior. For this reason in Table 2 we examine the link between sectoral outcomes and
individual level consumption behavior. The structure of the results in the Table is almost
identical to that of Table 1 except for the fact that we change the dependent variable. All
the regressors and the sample decisions are the same as in Table 1. The only difference is
that now the dependent variable is the change in the consumption of food for the household
as opposed to changes in the labor income of the head of household.
    While consumption of food is a quite narrow measure of consumption, it is the main
  34
     Details of the links used between the PSID classification and the NAICS are detailed in the Appendix.
  35
     In the specification using 10 sectors we cluster standard errors at the sectoral level. The effect of
clustering has very little effect on the standard errors. In the case of 2 or 3 sectors we did not cluster
standard errors as the number of sectors is too small. When we did try to cluster in such specifications, the
standard errors become very small, which seemed unreasonable.
  36
     The years with the required data are 1969-1970, 1972, 1974-1985, 1990-1991, and 1994-1995.

consumption variable available in the PSID. The estimated effects in Table 2 are considerably
smaller than in Table 1, but are nevertheless significant and sizable. The fact that the
coefficients are smaller should not be surprising as it is well established that people smooth
their consumption over time in response to temporary income shocks and further the measure
of income used in Table 1 is likely to be much more volatile than disposable family income
due to taxes and transfer payments such an unemployment insurance. The main result
we take from Table 2 is the observation that family level consumption behavior appears
to be significantly affected by the the performance of the sector with which the head was
initially associated. This suggests that asset and insurance markets, while important in
helping smooth income, are likely insufficient (or not sufficiently used) to entirely protect
individuals from temporary shocks to their sectors of employment.37

5.3     Related literature
The aim of this paper has been to illustrate how introducing explicit intra-temporal gains
from trade between individuals can shed light on a set of macroeconomic phenomena. In
particular, we have shown how labor market specialization can help explain (1) perception
driven booms and busts, (2) government spending having positive effects on private consump-
tion, and (3) non-inflationary demand driven expansion and non-deflationary busts. While
a strength of the approach is to offer a simple unified explanation for such behavior, there
are alternative models which can also explain some of these features. The related literature
is obviously expansive and therefore an exhaustive review is not possible here. Nonetheless,
it appears relevant to discuss a few alternatives that aim to address similar issues and clarify
some of their different implications. First, standard sticky price models can explain per-
ception driven booms and busts if the conduct of monetary policy is stated in a particular
form. But when sticky prices are central to the mechanism, it implies that inflation will also
respond to perception changes in a systematic way, which contrasts with our approach where
such fluctuations can arise without any systematic movement in inflation. At this point it
is unclear which view is more empirically relevant but they are very distinct mechanisms
with different implications which eventually should be possible to evaluate. The sticky price
model with a representative agent can also explain why government expenditures may in-
crease private consumption, but as discussed in Bilbiie [2011] the mechanism is rather subtle
as it only arises when agents preferences are non-separable between consumption and leisure.
In contrast, the mechanism in our model is quite transparent as government expenditures
will cause increases in consumption if the expenditures create gains from trade between those


                                               33
benefiting from the government expenditures and those that produce consumption goods.
    If we move away from sticky price models, there is also an important literature aimed
at explaining perception driven booms and bust38 within a flexible price setting. A notable
example of this literature is the paper by Jaimovich and Rebelo [2009].39 The mechanism
by which optimism about the future leads to increase in current economic activity in the
Jaimovich and Rebelo environment is very different to the one in the current paper. In
particular, the two key mechanisms in the Jaimovich and Rebelo framework are (1) that
optimism about the future leads to a decrease in the price of investment goods today –
because of adjustment costs to investment– and (2) that a reduction in the price of capital
today leads to increased labor productivity today and therefore labor demand given the
incentives to utilize capital more intensely. Such a mechanism is rather subtle when compared
to our mechanism based on labor market specialization whereby optimism about future
returns to holding capital favors trade between agents in the consumption sector and those
in the investment sector.40 At this point in time, we are unsure which mechanism is more
empirically relevant but this also offers relevant questions for future work.


6      Conclusion
Two of the key questions in macroeconomics are: What causes business cycle fluctuations
and to what extend can or should government mitigate such fluctuations? In this paper we
have shown how a macroeconomic model with explicit gains from trade between individuals
may provide a useful framework to help frame these issue. For example, when thinking
whether any exogenous change will cause an expansion or a recession, the aim of this paper
is to suggest that a meaningful way to pose the question is to ask is whether the impinging
force will expand or decrease the set of mutually desirable trades between individuals working
in different sectors of the economy. In such a framework an expansion is seen as a period
when there are substantial gains from trade between individuals in the different sectors of the
economy, while a recession where the amount of perceived gains from trade is low. Similarly,
if thinking about whether a government policy will reduce or exacerbate fluctuations, one
should ask how the intervention will affect the gains from trade between individuals in the
different sectors. Obviously for such an approach to be relevant, it must be the case that
workers are not perfectly mobile between sectors in the short run. Since such an assumption
seems rather plausible, it is not very surprising that considerable support for it can be found
in PSID data.
  38
     Here we do not consider the recent literature that uses measures of optimism to examine whether
perceptions may be important in fluctuations (see for example Farmer and Guo [1995], Carrol [2003], Harrison
and Weder [2006] Barsky and Sims [2010] and Leduc and Sill [2010]).
  39
     Other relevant contributions are Den Haan and Kaltenbrunner [2009], Eusepi and Preston [2009],
Beaudry and Portier [2004], Beaudry and Portier [2007] and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe [2008] among oth-
ers. An important difference between this literature and the current paper is that this literature does not
generally try to offer a unified explanation to how perception changes and government spending may induce
macroeconomic co-movements.
  40
     Our approach views perception changes as creating sectoral shocks, in particular creating shocks to the
investment sector relative to the consumption sector. In this dimension our framework shares ideas in the
sectoral shock literature as pioneered by Lilien [1982].



                                                    34
    One of the areas where we believe a gains from trade approach may be most helpful
is with respect to understanding fluctuations driven by changes in perceptions about the
future (whether these be rational or irrational perceptions). In the business press and in
the public at large it is common to think of changes in sentiment as a quintessential cause
of macroeconomic fluctuations. However, most modern macroeconomic models have certain
drawbacks, or work through subtle mechanisms to explain such outcomes. For example
in most New Keyensian models, depending on the monetary policy in place, a perception
driven boom should either cause consumption and investment to move in opposite directions
or cause inflation to increase substantially. Given our experience over the last thirty year with
cycles that appear primarily driven by perceptions of regarding the returns to investment,
none of these features are very compelling. In contrast, once one adopts a framework where
labor markets are segmented across different types of goods, we have shown that it is rather
easy to generate perception driven booms where consumption, investment and the price of
capital (as possibly captured by the stock market) all increase together without directly
putting pressure on inflation.

A         Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1: The first part of the proposition is shown to be satisfied by
the example given in the main text. All that remains to be shown is that strong positive
co-movement is not possible. We will show this by contradiction. So let us assume that an
increase in Ω1 leads to an increase in C i and Li for both agents 1 and 2. When consumption
and leisure are normal, this implies that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure
                   U i (C i ,1−Li )
and consumption U2i (C i ,1−Li ) increases for both agents.41 Without loss of generality, we can
                           1
                                                                                                    U i (C i ,1−Li )
assume that agent 1 works in the consumption sector, and hence the condition U2i (C i ,1−Li ) =
                                                                                         1
F1C (LC1 , LC2 ) must hold and accordingly F1C (LC1 , LC2 ) must increase in response to an
increase in Ω1 . There are then two cases to consider, either agent 1 is the only agent working
in the consumption sector or both agents are working in the consumption sector. If agent 1
is the only agent, then the marginal production in this sector is fixed due to CRS and hence
                                                  U 1 (C 1 ,1−L1 )
we have a contradiction as the condition U21 (C 1 ,1−L1 ) = F1C (LC1 ) cannot be satisfied if there is
                                                   1
strong positive co-movement. If both agents work in the consumption sector, then we need
U2i (C i ,1−Li )
U1i (C i ,1−Li )
                 = FiC (LC1 , LC2 ) to hold for both agents, which implies that the marginal product
must increase for each type of agent, that FiC (LC1 , LC2 ) must increase for i equal 1 and 2.
But with the production function satisfying concavity and CRS, this is not possible.42

Proof of Proposition 2: There are two components to this proposition. First we need
to show that with homogeneous labor, it is impossible to get positive co-movement. If labor
is homogeneous, then F1c (LC1 + LC2 ) = P F1K (LK1 + LK2 ). Since we are assuming that
the production function satisfies constant returns to scale, this implies that the marginal
                                                            U i (C i ,1−Li )
products are constant. It therefore directly follows that U2i (C i ,1−Li ) must remain constant
                                                             1
for each worker. Under the assumption that consumption and leisure are normal goods,
this implies that C i and Li must move in opposite directions (or remain unchanged) in
response to a change Ω1 and hence positive co-movement is impossible. The second part of
the proposition can be shown by example. In particular, Example 1 in section 3.3 is a case
with identical preferences in which changes in Ω1 cause individual positive co-movement and
positive price-quantity co-movement.

Proof of Proposition 3: This proposition uses the demand functions K i (P, wi , Ω1 ) and
the supply functions Li (P, wi , Ω1 ) to characterize the equilibrium. There are three equilib-
rium prices– P, w1 and w2 – that will adjust to equate demand and supply in the two labor
markets and in the market for capital (the market for consumption goods will be cleared by
Walras’ Law). Given that agents are specialized, the type 1 worker can produce only the
consumption good, and that the production function is one-to-one, then equilibrium in the
  41    U i (C i ,1−Li )
       d U2i (C i ,1−Li ) = [U1 U21 − U2 U11 ]dC + [U2 U12 − U1 U22 ]dL. The two terms in brackets are precisely the
         1
                                                                                    U2
conditions defining normal goods, hence dC and dL positive implies an increase in U  1
                                                                                       .

     For both marginal products to increase we need F11 dL + F12 dL > 0 and F12        dLC1 + F22 C
                                                                                                    dLC2 > 0.

                     C       C L          C      C L                                        dL      dLC2
CRS implies that F12    = −F11 LC2
                                    and F12 = −F22 LC1
                                                        . This implies that we need LC   C
                                                                                     1 F11 [ LC1 − LC2 ] > 0

type 1 labor market implies w1 = 1. Similarly, given that type 2 can only produce the invest-
ment good, equilibrium in the type 2 labor market implies that w2 = P . The equilibrium
determination of p is therefore determined by the condition

                        K 1 (P, 1; Ω1 ) + K 2 (P, P ; Ω1 ) = L2 (P, P ; Ω1 ).

Hence the effect of Ω1 on P is given by

                              dP      L23 − K32 − K31
                                 = 2                         .                         (A.1)
                              dθ  K1 + K22 + K11 − L21 − L22

To sign this effect, we need to look at properties of the demand functions. These will
depend on on four terms Λ, χ, Γ, ∆ which are defined as follows (where subscripts represent
derivative)
                                                    2
                                    Λ ≡ U22 U11 − U12 ,                               (A.2)

                                 χ = w2 U11 − 2wU12 + U22 ,

where concavity implies that Λ is positive and χ is negative. Furthermore, since C and
(1 − L) are normal goods, this implies that:

                                      Γ ≡ wU11 − U12 < 0,                              (A.3)

                                     ∆ ≡ wU12 − U22 > 0.                               (A.4)
Given these definition, the derivative of the demand functions are given as follows

                                    Γ (V11 K + V1 )
                          L1 =                      R 0,                               (A.5)
                                      p2 Λ + χV11
                                    χU1 − pKΛ
                          K1 =                    < 0,                                 (A.6)
                                    p2 Λ + χV11
                                      ΓlV11 + U1 (p2 U11 + V11 )
                          L2 =      −                            R 0,                  (A.7)
                                             p2 Λ + χV11
                                    p (lΛ − ΓU1 )
                          K2 =                    > 0,                                 (A.8)
                                     p2 Λ + χV11
                                          pΓV12
                          L3 =      − 2            > 0,                                (A.9)
                                      p Λ + χV11
                                          χV12
                          K3 =      − 2            > 0.                               (A.10)
                                      p Λ + χV11
Therefore we have
                                              (χ − P Γ) V12
                               L23 − K22 =                  ,
                                               P 2 Λ + χV11
                                                 −∆V12
                                            =   2
                                                            < 0,
                                              P Λ + χV11


                                                 38
so the numerator on the RHS of (A.1) is negative. The assumptions in the Proposition
assure that the denominator is negative. Hence under the conditions of the proposition we
have
                                           dP
                                               > 0.
                                          dΩ1
   To examine the effects of an increase in Ω1 on consumption, investment and employment
we now need to examine if L1 and L2 increase with Ω1 , taking into account its effect on
equilibrium prices. Hence for positive co-movement we need
                             dP                                  dP
                       L11       + L13 > 0,       (L21 + L22 )       + L23 > 0.
                             dΩ1                                 dΩ1

Since Li3 > 0, then by the assumptions of the proposition we have that an increase in Ω1
leads to positive co-movement.

Proof of Proposition 4: With ex-ante trading in claims dependent on Ω1 , the agent’s
first order conditions are of the form

                                   Πm U1i (Cm
                                            i
                                              , 1 − Lim ) = λi pcm ,

                                   Πm U2i (Cm
                                            i
                                              , 1 − Lim ) = λi wm
                                                                i
                                                                  ,
                                     Πm V1i (Km
                                              i
                                                , Ω1 ) = λi pkm ,
where λi is the multiplier related to agent i’s budget set. If labor is homogeneous, then
       i
pcm = wm for i = 1, 2, and therefore

                                       U1i (Cm
                                             i
                                               , 1 − Lim )
                                                           = 1.
                                       U2i (Cm
                                             i , 1 − Li )
                                                       m

Hence, because goods are normal, consumption and labor have to move in opposite directions
and therefore positive co-movement induced by realizations of Ω1 is not possible.
    If agents are specialized, then for the agent in the consumption good sector, it will
                         U i (C i ,1−Li )
again be the case that U1i (Cmi ,1−Lm i ) = 1 and hence his consumption cannot increase if his
                          2    m      m
employment increases. Further, we have the risk sharing condition that implies that the
marginal utility of consumption must move in the same direction for both types of agents.
Under separable preferences, this implies that consumption of both types must move in
tandem. Given that the consumption of the type working in the consumption sector can
increase with an increase in his labor, this implies that aggregate consumption does not move
with a change in Ω1 hence positive co-movement is not possible.

Proof of Proposition 5: When labor is homogeneous, an increase in government pur-
chases of investment goods will not change marginal products. Hence, normality implies
that C i and Li must move in opposite directions and therefore positive co-movement is not
possible as employment will need to decrease for at least one type of labor if consumption is
to increase.


                                                  39
Proof of Proposition 6: For this proposition, we will work with the demand functions
K i (p, wi , Ω1 , T i ) and the labor supply function Li (p, wi , Ω1 , T i ) where these functions are
defined as the solution to
                                   max U i (C i , 1 − Li ) + V i (K i , Ω1 )
                                 C i ,K i ,Li

subject to
                                           C i + P K i = w i Li − T i .
Under the maintained assumptions on utility, these functions continue to have the properties
spelled out in the proof of Proposition 3. In addition, it is easy to verify that Li4 > 0, K4i > 0,
0 > pK4i > 1 and 1 > (L24 − K42 ) > 0. Therefore, to verify the proposition all we need is to
            dP
check that dG   > 0, where P solves the capital market equilibrium condition given by
                  K 1 (P, 1, Ω1 , T 1 ) + K 2 (P, P, Ω1 , T 2 ) + G = L2 (P, P, Ω1 , T 2 ).
When T 1 = αP G and T 2 = (1 − α)P G, we have
       dP             L24 (1 − α)P − 1 − K42 (1 − α)P − K41 αP
          = 2                                                                .                (A.11)
       dθ  K1 + K22 + K42 (1 − α)P + K11 + K41 αP − L21 − L22 − L24 (1 − α)P
The properties of the demand functions imply that numerator of this expression is negative,
and the assumptions of the proposition ( K12 + K22 + K11 < 0, L21 ≥ 0 and L22 ≥ 0) again com-
bined with the properties of the demand functions imply that the denominator is negative,
      dP
hence dG > 0.
   To examine whether an increase in G (on investment) leads to an increase in total in-
vestment we need to examine the sign of
                                                      dP
                             L21 + L22 + L24 (1 − α)G     + L24 (1 − α)P.
                                                       dG
The assumptions of the proposition (regarding labor supply) and the properties of the labor
supply function imply that this term is positive.
    To examine whether an increase in G (on investment) does not lead to an increase in
private investment we need to examine the sign of
                                                                dP
             (K11 + K41 αG + K12 + K22 + K42 (1 − α)G)             + K41 αP + K21 (1 − α)P.
                                                                dG
The assumptions of the proposition (regarding capital demand) and the properties of the
labor supply function imply that this term is negative.
   Finally to examine whether the fiscal policy leads to an increase in the production of
consumption good we need to examine the sign of
                                                          dP
                                         (L11 + L14 αG)      + L14 αP.
                                                          dG
The assumptions of the proposition (regarding labor supply) and the properties of the labor
supply function imply that this term is positive. Hence, an increase in Government expen-
ditures on investment goods causes positive co-movement, with a positive spillover effect on
consumption but a negative effect on private investment (no amplification).

B       Analytical steps of A New Keynesian model with
        explicit gains from trade
Let us consider a simple New Keynesian model that we augment to include explicit gains
from trade between individuals. Some agents will produce the consumption good and some
the investment good. Although we allow for capital accumulation and agents heterogeneity,
we will make functional forms assumptions to preserve tractability of the model. The model
will have the basic New Keynesian model of Galı́ [2008] as a special case.

B.1     Fundamentals
B.1.1    Preferences
The economy is populated by nC consumption good workers and nX investment good work-
ers. All agents consume an aggregate consumption good, that is a basket of monopolistically
produced consumption goods indexed by j. Denoting cCt and cXt the consumption of a
representative consumption good worker and of a representative investment good worker, we
have:

                                               ε−1

                                           Z     1    ε−1
                                                                 ε−1

   Consumption workers are all identical, infinitely lived and have preferences over con-
sumption and leisure given by
                              X
                                 β t (ln(cct ) + Φ(1 − `Ct )) .

with 1 > β > 0 and Φ > 0. For simplicity, investment workers are myopic, and do not make
intertemporal choices: they do not own any assets nor have any liabilities, and just consume
their current labor income. Their preferences are given by

                                                `1+γ
                                                    
                                                 Xt
                                    U cXt − Ψ          ,
                                                1+γ

with γ > 0 and where U is a concave and C 2 function.

B.1.2    Technologies
Each monopoly j produces a variety of consumption good according to the following constant
return to scale technology:
                                  Cjt = Θt Kjt + At LCt .
Capital and labor are perfectly substitutable in the production of consumption good varieties,
which allow for an easier analytical solution. Θt is a capital specific stochastic technological

                                                41
shocks and At a labor specific one.43 For simplicity, these are the only source of uncertainty
in the model.
    The investment good is produced by a representative competitive firm, with labor only,
and according to the constant return to scale technology:

                                               Xt = BLXt .

Capital accumulates according to the following law of motion, with δ ∈ [0, 1]:

                                        Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + Xt .

B.1.3      Markets organization
There is a monopoly for each variety of the consumption good. Labor, investment good,
bonds and money markets are competitive. Money is the numéraire. Total real output (or
real GDP) is measured in units of consumption and is defined as

                                                          Rt
                                            Yt = C t +       Xt ,
                                                          Pt
where Pt is the consumption goods price index and Rt is the price of the investment good.

B.1.4      Price setting
When prices are sticky, we assume Calvo price setting. In order to embed the standard model
of Galı́ as a special case of our model when nX = 0, we assume that prices are sticky in the
consumption good sector only. Each consumption firm may reset its price with probability
1 − θ, θ ∈ [0, 1]. In the investment good sector, we maintain the assumption of flexible
prices.

B.1.5      Monetary authorities
The central bank sets the nominal interest rate following a Taylor rule.

B.2       Households
B.2.1      Consumption worker
                                                                                  P∞
The representative consumption worker maximizes expected utility E0 [                t=0   β t (ln cCt + Φ(1 − `Ct ))]
subject to the budget constraint:

               Pt cCt + Rt kt+1 + Qt bt ≤ ((1 − δ)Rt + Zt )kt + WCt `Ct + tCt + Bt−1 ,
 43
      One can allow for a correlation between Θ and A, to account for total factor productivity shocks.

   From (B.2) and (B.12), on obtains
                                    CCt = nC (MΦ)−1 At .                                (B.15)
Note that only At (and not Θt ) enters in the consumption worker’s consumption, which
will happen to be very convenient for tractability when comparing with the sticky prices
allocations. This is of course not a general result. Using (B.11), (B.3) becomes
                                                                 

The real price (in units of the consumption good) of one unit of investment equals its next
period discounted marginal productivity and resale price net of depreciation. Using the
expression of Cct obtained in (B.15), we get
                                                                

Solving forward, we obtain the solution for the price of investment:

                                              45
Once the real price of investment is obtained, the rest of the model can be recursively solved
as all the other variables are statically related to the real price of investment.

B.4.2   Log-linear approximation
It is useful to write the model solution when a log-linear approximation around the non
stochastic steady state is taken. Using a hat for log deviations from the steady state and
with the notation z = Z/P and r = R/P , equation (B.3) becomes
         rt − b
        (b    cCt ) = β(1 − δ)Et [b
                                  rt+1 − b
                                         cct+1 ] + (1 − β(1 − δ))Et [b
                                                                     zt+1 − b
                                                                            cct+1 ] .                                       (B.18)
(B.2) and (B.12) give b
                      cCt = Abt and (B.11) gives zbt = Θ
                                                       b t . Substituting in (B.18) and solving
forward, we obtain
                                         X∞                  h                 i
              rbt = At + ((1 − β(1 − δ))

Denoting by χ = CCC the steady state share of the consumption worker’s consumption in
total consumption and by sc = YC the share of consumption in GDP, we have the following
expressions for aggregate consumption and real GDP:
                                          b     cCt + (1 − χ)b
                                          ct = χb              cXt ,                                                        (B.20)
                                                 ct + (1 − sc )(b
                                         ybt = scb              rt + x
                                                                     bt ).                                                  (B.21)
Using (B.8), (B.9) and (B.10), we obtain an expression of Xt as a function of Rptt . Note
that trade between the two type of agents is made apparent by observing that the budget
constraint of the investment worker is
                                                  Rt

Using (B.20), (B.21) and (B.22), we obtain

B.5.2   Optimal pricing
Solving for a log-linear version of (B.1), and using the fact that there are constant returns
in the production of the consumption goods, one obtains

                                     π
                                     bt = βEt π

with λ = (1−θ)(1−βθ)
              θ
                     , where mc
                             c is the real marginal cost log deviation from steady state in the
consumption good sector and π   bt the log deviation of inflation Pt /Pt−1 . Note that inflation
here CPI inflation. The average real marginal cost is given by

                                         mc   bCt − pbt .
                                         ct = w

Using (B.25) and (B.35), we get
                                         mc   cCt − A
                                         ct = b     bt ,

so that (B.40) becomes                                     

B.5.3    Log-linear approximation
Equations (B.25), (B.34) and (B.35) gives zbt = Θ       bt − M  ct and b       bt − M
                                                                       cct+1 = A    ct , so that
zbt − b     bt − A
      cCt = Θ     bt . Note that zbt − b
                                       cCt takes the same value in both the flexible and sticky
price cases. Therefore, using (B.18) and using the n subscript for the flexible price allocations
(n for natural), we obtain
                                       rbt − rbtn = b
                                                    cCt − Abt .                            (B.42)
   Let us define the output gap yet = ybt − ybtn . Using (B.23) (that holds both in the flexible
and sticky prices cases), we obtain
                                                       
                                     yet = ζ b cCt − At ,
                                                      b                                  (B.43)
                                                                                      
with ζ = 1−scγχ+γ . From this equation, we obtain an expression for           bcCt − A
                                                                                     bt that we
substitute in (B.41) to obtain a typical New Keynesian Phillips curve:

                                     π        bt+1 + λζ −1 yet .
                                     bt = βEt π                                           (B.44)

   Furthermore, the log-linear approximation of equation (B.26) gives

                                 b       cCt+1 − (bıt − Et π
                                 cCt = Etb                 bt+1 ).                        (B.45)

Using again equation (B.43), we obtain the dynamic IS equation

                                                bt+1 − ρbtn ) + Et yet+1 .
                             yet = −ζ (bıt − Et π                                         (B.46)

   To summarize, allocations of the sticky price model are the given by
                       
                        yet = −ζ (bıt − Et πbt+1 − ρbtn ) + Et yet+1 ,
                          π
                          bt = βEt π  bt+1 + λζ −1 yet ,
                          +       Taylor rule.

   Using (B.24), the Phillips curve can be written as

B.6     Obtaining the basic New Keynesian model
If we assume that there are no investment workers (nX =0), then no investment is produced
(Xt = 0) and no capital is used in the production of consumption varieties. Therefore, we
are back to the standard model with ybt = b ct = b cCt . In the flexible price allocations, labor
is constant, so that natural output is given by ybtn = A   bt and the natural real interest rate
   n     bt+1 − A
ρbt = Et A       bt .
     The model solution is then given by the standard three equations:
                           
                            yet = Et yet+1 − (bıt − Et πbt+1 − ρbtn ) ,
                              π
                              bt = βEt π bt+1 + λb yt ,
                              +      Taylor rule.
