                                         ABSTRACT

The Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics exploits the fact that macroeconomic models often
display multiple equilibria to understand real-world phenomena. There are two distinct phases in
the evolution of its history. The first phase began as a research agenda at the University of
Pennsylvania in the U.S. and at CEPREMAP in Paris in the early 1980s. This phase used models
of dynamic indeterminacy to explain how shocks to beliefs can temporarily influence economic
outcomes. The second phase was developed at the University of California Los Angeles in the
2000s. This phase uses models of incomplete factor markets to explain how shocks to beliefs can
permanently influence economic outcomes. The first phase of the Indeterminacy School has been
used to explain volatility in financial markets. The second phase of the Indeterminacy School has
been used to explain periods of high persistent unemployment. The two phases of the
Indeterminacy School provide a microeconomic foundation to Keynes’ General Theory that does
not rely on the assumption that prices and wages are sticky.

       Summary

       The Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics exploits the fact that

       macroeconomic models often display multiple equilibria to understand real-world

       phenomena. There are two distinct phases in the evolution of its history. The first

       phase began as a research agenda at the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S.

       and at CEPREMAP in Paris in the early 1980s. This phase used models of

       dynamic indeterminacy to explain how shocks to beliefs can temporarily

       influence economic outcomes. The second phase was developed at the University

       of California Los Angeles in the 2000s. This phase uses models of incomplete

       factor markets to explain how shocks to beliefs can permanently influence

       economic outcomes. The first phase of the Indeterminacy School has been used to

       explain volatility in financial markets. The second phase of the Indeterminacy

       School has been used to explain periods of high persistent unemployment. The

       two phases of the Indeterminacy School provide a microeconomic foundation to

       Keynes’ General Theory that does not rely on the assumption that prices and

       wages are sticky.

Indeterminacy and Multiple Equilibria in Economics

       The Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics exploits the fact that macroeconomic

models often display multiple equilibria to understand real-world phenomena. Economists have

long argued that business cycles are driven by shocks to the productivity of labour and capital.

According to the Indeterminacy School, the self-fulfilling beliefs of financial market participants

are additional independent fundamental factors that drive periods of prosperity and depression.2

Monetary General Equilibrium Theory

       The history of macroeconomics, as a theory distinct from microeconomics, began with

the publication of The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money, (Keynes, 1936) a

book by the English economist John Maynard Keynes. Keynes revolutionised the way

economists think about the economy and he revolutionised the way politicians think about the

role of economic policy. For the first time, with the publication of The General Theory, policy

makers accepted that government has an obligation to maintain full employment. The publication

of Keynes’ master work led to two decades of research that attempted to integrate the ideas of

The General Theory, with General Equilibrium (GE) Theory, the branch of microeconomics that

deals with the working of the economy as a whole. That research led to the publication of Money

Interest and Prices, a book by Don Patinkin, (Patinkin, 1956) which laid the foundation for much

of the research that followed.

       In Money Interest and Prices, Patinkin integrated General Equilibrium Theory, which

explains the determination of the relative price of one good to another, with the quantity theory

of money, which explains the average price of all goods measured in units of money. Patinkin’s

synthesis led to the development of Monetary General Equilibrium (MGE) theory, an approach

that forms the basis for much of modern macroeconomics.



       5
       In MGE theory, as with non-monetary versions of GE theory, market outcomes result

from the interactions of hundreds of millions of market participants, each of whom assumes that

he has no influence over market prices. An equilibrium is a set of equilibrium trades and an

equilibrium price vector such that, when confronted with equilibrium prices, no market

participant would choose to make additional trades. Although it has been known for decades that

there may be more than one equilibrium price vector, much of the literature in macroeconomics

that developed from Patinkin’s synthesis has made theoretical assumptions that render

equilibrium unique.

Multiplicity and Determinacy of Equilibria

       GE theory can be used to develop static GE models that explain the determination of

prices and quantities traded at a single date. Or it can be used to develop dynamic GE models

that explain the determination of prices and quantities traded at a sequence of dates. Static and

dynamic general equilibrium models each have multiple equilibria. When the number of

commodities and the number of people are finite, each equilibrium is locally isolated from every

other equilibrium. In this case, each equilibrium is said to be determinate. When the number of

commodities and the number of people is infinite, there may be a contiguous set of equilibria. In

this case, each member of the set is said to be indeterminate.

       Determinacy of equilibrium is an important property if one is interested in comparing

how the equilibrium price vector changes in response to a change in economic fundamentals. For

example, if the demand curve shifts to the right, what will happen to the equilibrium price of

wheat? For this question to have a meaningful answer, the equilibrium price of wheat must be

determinate.




       6
Phase 1: Models of Dynamic Indeterminacy

       The Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics has gone through two phases. The first

phase, developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States and at CEPREMAP in

France, consisted of dynamic models driven by the self-fulfilling beliefs of economic actors.

Initially, these models were populated by overlapping generations of finitely-lived people. The

focus soon shifted to infinite horizon models inhabited by an infinitely-lived representative agent

in which the technology exhibits increasing returns-to-scale. This literature, surveyed in

Benhabib and Farmer (1999), generates equilibria that display dynamic indeterminacy and the

promise of the literature on dynamic indeterminacy, was that it would provide a micro-

foundation for Keynesian economics.4

       The literature on dynamic indeterminacy made an important contribution to Keynesian

economics by demonstrating that ‘animal spirits’ may be fully consistent with market clearing

and rational expectations. But it did not fulfil the promise of providing a micro-foundation to

Keynes’ General Theory. 5 Like the real business cycle (RBC) model (Kydland & Prescott,

1982) (Long & Plosser, 1983) (King, Plosser, & Rebelo, 1988), models of dynamic

indeterminacy represent business cycles as stationary stochastic fluctuations around a non-

stochastic steady state. In RBC models, the driving source of fluctuations is technology shocks.

In models that display dynamic indeterminacy, the driving source of fluctuations is the self-

fulfilling beliefs of agents. In both types of models, equilibria are almost Pareto efficient. These

models cannot explain large persistent unemployment rates of the kind that occurred during the

Great Depression or the recent financial crisis.6




       7
Phase 2: Models of Steady-state Indeterminacy

       The second phase of the literature on indeterminacy departs from the assumption that the

demand and supply of labour are always equal and assumes instead that labour is traded in a

search market. This phase is able to generate large welfare losses and high persistent involuntary

unemployment of the kind that Keynes discusses in the General Theory. The models developed

in this literature possess equilibria that display steady-state indeterminacy.7 These equilibria are

characterized as non-stationary probability measures, driven by shocks to self-fulfilling beliefs,

and they have very different empirical implications from either RBC models or models of

dynamic indeterminacy. They imply that the unemployment rate is non-stationary and that it can

wander a very long way from the social optimum unemployment rate. As a consequence, the

welfare losses generated by self-fulfilling fluctuations in these models can be very large.


General Equilibrium Theory and Macroeconomics

       The initial formulation of General Equilibrium theory assumed that there are a finite

number of goods and a finite number of people. There have been two extensions to deal with

issues that arise naturally in macroeconomics from the passage of time and the fact that the

future is uncertain. The first, due to Gérard Debreu (Debreu, 1959), redefines a commodity to be

specific to the date, location and state of nature in which it is consumed. The second, due to Sir

John Hicks (Hicks, 1939), explicitly recognizes the sequential nature of markets.8

Finite General Equilibrium Theory

       General equilibrium theory deals with market exchange of ℓ commodities by 𝑚𝑚 people

and, as formulated by Kenneth Arrow and Debreu (1954), ℓ and 𝑚𝑚 are finite numbers. By

making assumptions about the structure of the economy one arrives at an excess demand

function, 𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝): ℝℓ) → ℝℓ which is a list of the differences between the aggregate quantities

       8
demanded and supplied of each of the ℓ commodities when the prices of each good are

represented by the ℓ-element vector 𝑝𝑝. A vector 𝑝𝑝∗ that satisfies the equation 𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝∗ ) = 0 is called

an equilibrium price vector.

       In his initial formulation of GE theory, Walras assumed the existence of a fictitious

character, the auctioneer, who stands on a platform in the centre of the marketplace and calls out

prices at which trades will take place.9 Given a vector of prices, each participant decides how

much he would like to trade. The auctioneer adds up the desired trades of every person and if the

aggregate quantity of every commodity demanded is equal to the aggregate quantity of every

commodity supplied, the auctioneer declares success and trades are executed. Alternatively, if

there is an excess demand or supply for one or more commodities, the auctioneer adjusts the

vector of proposed prices and he tries again. The adjustment process by which the auctioneer

homes in on an equilibrium price vector is called tâtonnement, a French word which means

groping.

Debreu Chapter 7 as a Paradigm for Macroeconomics

       In Debreu’s (1959) extension of GE theory to an infinite dimensional space a commodity

is not just an apple, a banana, or a loaf of bread; it is an apple, a banana or a loaf of bread traded

on March 9th, 2024 in Mexico City if and only if it is raining in Caracas.

       Infinite horizon general equilibrium models may be populated by two kinds of agents. If

trades are made by a finite number of infinitely-lived families the model is said to be a

Representative Agent (RA) model. If trades are made by an infinite number of finitely-lived

people, it is said to be an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model. These two kinds of models

have very different properties.10 In the RA model, there is a finite odd number of equilibria and,

as in finite General Equilibrium Theory, every equilibrium is Pareto optimal.11 In the OLG



       9
model, there may be Pareto inefficient equilibria that do not display this property as a

consequence of the double infinity of goods and people.12 The fact that market outcomes may be

Pareto inefficient is important, because, when the competitive equilibrium is inefficient, there

may exist a government policy that would improve the welfare of everyone.

Temporary Equilibrium Theory as a Paradigm for Macroeconomics

       Debreu’s extension of GE theory to infinite horizons does not explicitly require the

passage of time. The date at which a commodity is consumed is simply one of many labels that

index the good. Bread today is distinct from bread tomorrow in the same way that an apple is

distinct from a banana. The tâtonnement process whereby the market achieves equilibrium takes

place at the beginning of time, and once an equilibrium has been arrived at, the world begins and

trades are executed. This is a rather unrealistic, and unsatisfactory description of the world we

inhabit.

       A more promising alternative, Temporary Equilibrium (TE) Theory, envisages the

passage of time as a sequence of weeks.13 Each week, market participants come to a marketplace

to trade commodities with each other. Each person brings a bundle of commodities, his

endowment, and he leaves with a different bundle of commodities, his allocation. Participants

arrive at the marketplace with financial assets and liabilities contracted in previous weeks and

they form beliefs about the prices of commodities they think will prevail in future weeks. TE

theory allows for the beliefs of market participants about future prices to be different from prices

that actually occur.

Asset Markets, Risk and Uncertainty

       This section discusses the connection between TE theory and Debreu Chapter 7 and

demonstrates that, under some circumstances, the equilibria that occur in Debreu’s formulation



       10
of an equilibrium are the same as the equilibria that occur in a TE model. To understand the

connection of Debreu Chapter 7 with TE theory we turn first to an explanation of the way that

GE theory accounts for the fact that the future is unknown.

       The economist Frank Knight (Knight, 1921) distinguished risk from uncertainty. Risk

refers to events that are quantifiable by a known probability distribution. Uncertainty refers to

events that are unknown and unknowable. Almost all quantitative work in macroeconomics has

been conducted in models where unknown future events fall into Knight’s first category; they

can be quantified by a known probability distribution. That approach will also be followed in the

current survey.

       Consider an environment where markets open each week but there is more than one

possible future, characterized by a known set of 𝑁𝑁 possible events. For example, if 𝑁𝑁 = 2,

nature flips a coin that comes up heads with probability 𝜒𝜒1 and tails with probability 𝜒𝜒2 = 1 −

𝜒𝜒1 . To model this scenario, Arrow (1964) suggested people trade basic securities, called Arrow

securities, that pay out a fixed dollar amount if and only an event occurs. When there are as

many Arrow securities as events, the markets are said to be complete.

       Complete markets in the case of a binary event such as a coin toss would require two

securities. The H security is a promise to pay one dollar next week if and only if the outcome is

heads. The 𝑇𝑇 security is a promise to pay one dollar next week if and only if the outcome is tails.

In week 1, person 𝑖𝑖 faces the budget constraint

 [1]                               𝑝𝑝89 :𝑥𝑥8< − 𝑤𝑤8< > + 𝑄𝑄1 𝑎𝑎1

                                                                 + 𝑄𝑄B 𝑎𝑎<B ≤ 0.

Here, 𝑝𝑝8 is an ℓ × 1 vector of dollar prices in date 1, 𝑤𝑤8< is an ℓ × 1 vector that represents person

𝑖𝑖’s endowment and 𝑥𝑥8< is an ℓ × 1 vector that represents her allocation. 𝑄𝑄1 and 𝑄𝑄B are the dollar

prices of the two arrow securities and 𝑎𝑎1 and 𝑎𝑎<B , which may be positive or negative, are the

positions taken by the 𝑖𝑖’th person in the two securities.14

        In week 2 one of two events may occur. If the outcome is heads, person 𝑖𝑖 faces the

constraint,

                                           9     <      <        <
 [2]                                     𝑝𝑝F1 :𝑥𝑥F1 − 𝑤𝑤F1 > − 𝑎𝑎1 ≤ 0.

If the outcome is tails, she faces the constraint,

                                            9     <      <
 [3]                                      𝑝𝑝FB :𝑥𝑥FB − 𝑤𝑤FB > − 𝑎𝑎<B ≤ 0.

                                      <
By substituting the expressions for 𝑎𝑎1 and 𝑎𝑎<B from the period 2 budget constraints, Equations

[2] and [3], into the period 1 budget constraint, Equation [1], one arrives at the following

consolidated budget constraint,

 [4]                𝑝𝑝89 :𝑥𝑥8< − 𝑤𝑤8< > + 𝑄𝑄1 𝑝𝑝F1
                                                9     <

                                                         − 𝑤𝑤F1           9
                                                                > + 𝑄𝑄B 𝑝𝑝FB    <
                                                                             :𝑥𝑥FB     <
                                                                                   − 𝑤𝑤FB > ≤ 0.

In the GE interpretation of uncertainty, people maximize utility in period 1,

 [5]                                    maxM ,K M }
                                                      𝑈𝑈 < :𝑥𝑥8< , 𝑥𝑥F1
                                                                     <      <
                                                                        , 𝑥𝑥FB ; 𝜒𝜒1 , 𝜒𝜒B >,
                                    { KLM,KOP  OQ


subject to the constraint defined by Inequality [4]. The dependence of utility on the probability of

alternative outcomes is represented here by the appearance of the probabilities of heads or tails,

𝜒𝜒1 and 𝜒𝜒2 , in the utility function. In the TE interpretation of uncertainty, people solve two

consecutive utility maximization problems. In period 1 they choose a vector of current

consumptions 𝑥𝑥8< and a pair of asset positions 𝑎𝑎1
                                                  <
                                                    and 𝑎𝑎<B , subject to their beliefs about the prices

that will occur in the future.

        For the GE solution and the rational expectations TE solution to be the same, two

conditions must hold. First, there must be as many Arrow securities as states of nature. This

condition guarantees that the sequence of budget constraints can be reduced to a single budget

constraint. Second, utility must be time consistent. This condition means that the way that people
        12
rank choices over the ℓ elements of 𝑥𝑥F< must be independent of the choices they made in period 1.

And it is one reason that economists often assume that the problem in Equation [5] is linear in

probabilities, that is

The function 𝑣𝑣 < (𝑥𝑥8< , 𝑥𝑥FW
                            <
                               ) for 𝑠𝑠 ∈ {𝐻𝐻, 𝑇𝑇} is called a Von-Neumann Morgenstern utility function

and when people maximize expression [6] they are said to be expected utility maximizers. Von-

Neumann Morgenstern expected utility maximizers are time consistent.

        The assumption of complete markets allows for a relatively straightforward extension of

the perfect foresight assumption to a world with uncertainty. If there is one future state and

people know all future prices, the agents in the model are said to possess perfect foresight. If

there is more than one possible future state, and people know all future state-contingent prices,

the agents in the model are said to possess rational expectations.

        The translation of Debreu’s version of GE theory into the language of TE theory exposes

a problem with the assumption that people take prices as given. GE theory does not guarantee

that equilibrium is unique. If there are multiple equilibria, how do participants in this week’s

market know which of the equilibrium price vectors will be attained in future markets? The

following section turns to a description of the problems raised in GE models by the existence of

multiple equilibria and it offers a solution to the problem of indeterminacy. Beliefs should be

introduced as a separate fundamental in addition to preferences, endowments and technology.


Multiplicity and Determinacy of Equilibrium

        This section compares finite and infinite horizon GE models and illustrates, by means of

three simple figures, the meaning of determinacy of equilibrium. The section begins by

demonstrating that there is a finite odd number of equilibria in a finite general equilibrium

        13
model, and it proceeds to explain how the equilibrium concept can be extended to deal with the

passage of time.

Finite GE Theory: Why Equilibria are Determinate

          That equilibria are determinate is most easily understood in the case of a two-good model

and is illustrated in Figure 1. Here, 𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) is the aggregate excess demand for good 1 and 𝑝𝑝 =
 [L
         is the money price of good 1, normalized by the sum of the two money prices. One can
[L )[O


show that 𝑓𝑓(0) > 0, 𝑓𝑓 (1) < 0 and 𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) is continuous. It follows that the graph 𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) is a

continuous function [0,1] → ℝ that starts above the 𝑝𝑝-axis and ends below the 𝑝𝑝-axis. Hence

𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) must cross the 𝑝𝑝-axis at least once and generically, the number of crossings is odd. Figure

1 illustrates the case of three equilibrium prices.




          14
       This figure also shows that equilibrium cannot, generically, be indeterminate.

Indeterminacy, in the finite case, would require the excess demand function to be coincident with

the 𝑝𝑝-axis for an interval of 𝑝𝑝-values. That would be a very special case, as would a tangency of

the excess demand function with the 𝑝𝑝-axis. Genericity means that, in the space of all

parameterized 2-good GE models, models with indeterminate equilibria or models with an even

number of equilibria occur vanishingly often. Although such a model could be constructed, a

small perturbation of the parameters of the model would generate a different model where the

indeterminacy or the tangency disappears.

Infinite Horizon Models with Representative Agents

       When the number of commodities is infinite, an equilibrium price vector is an element of

𝔅𝔅, the space of non-negative bounded sequences. 15 If the number of people is finite, as in the RA

model, there is an odd finite number of equilibria just as there is in the finite Arrow-Debreu

model. These equilibria need not be stationary, but they cannot be indeterminate. If the number

of people is infinite, as in the OLG model, there are always at least two stationary equilibrium

price sequences and at least one of these stationary equilibrium price sequences is indeterminate.

       Figure 2 illustrates the situation that typically occurs in RA models. The figure plots three

sequences, 𝑝𝑝∗ , 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ as functions of time. The elements of each sequence are indexed by

subscripts that refer to weeks and the sequence 𝑝𝑝∗ is, by assumption, a stationary perfect

foresight equilibrium price sequence. The statement that 𝑝𝑝∗ is an equilibrium price sequence

means that the quantities of all goods demanded and supplied are equal in every week. The

statement that 𝑝𝑝∗ is a stationary sequence means that 𝑝𝑝a∗ is constant over time. And the qualifier,

‘perfect foresight’, means that when people form their demands and supplies at date 𝑡𝑡, they are

fully aware of what the prices will be in all future periods.


       15
        In general, 𝑝𝑝a∗ could be an element of ℝℓ) , that is, there may be multiple goods traded in

each period. For the purposes of exposition, it will be assumed here that ℓ = 1, and that 𝑝𝑝a∗ is the

dollar price of the unique date 𝑡𝑡 commodity which will be referred to as ‘wheat’. Using this

convention, the notation 𝑝𝑝c∗ , for example, refers to the dollar price of wheat in week 3. In

contrast to the stationary equilibrium price sequence, 𝑝𝑝∗ , the sequences 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ , are non-

stationary. A sequence that begins at 𝑝𝑝88∗ or 𝑝𝑝8∗F grows without bound and heads off either to plus

infinity, in the case of 𝑝𝑝8∗ or to negative infinity, in the case of 𝑝𝑝F∗ . The sequences 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗

start close to the stationary equilibrium sequence, 𝑝𝑝∗ , but they eventually diverge from it.

        To measure the distance between two elements of 𝔅𝔅, economists use the sup norm, which

records the distance between two sequences as the largest distance between any two elements of

the sequence. If 𝑝𝑝∗ is a stationary equilibrium price sequence of an RA model, often it will be

        16
possible to find perfect foresight price sequences, 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ that obey the market clearing

conditions for some finite number of periods. But, however close these sequences are initially to

the steady-state equilibrium price sequence 𝑝𝑝∗ , they will eventually move away from it. In the

example depicted in Figure 2, the sequences 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ diverge to plus or minus infinity.

       One can show using a result first proved by Negishi (1960), that every equilibrium price

sequence of an RA model is bounded away from every other equilibrium price sequence by a

positive number. An implication of Negishi’s theorem, is that stationary equilibrium price

sequences must always display the local instability property depicted in Figure 2.

Infinite Horizon Models with Overlapping Generations

       OLG Models are different from RA models. In OLG models it is no longer true that

equilibrium price sequences must be isolated from each other, and instead, sets of indeterminate

equilibria are common. Figure 3 illustrates a situation that occurs generically in OLG models.




       17
This figure plots three price sequences, 𝑝𝑝∗ , 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ as functions of time. 𝑝𝑝∗ is a stationary-

equilibrium price sequence and 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ are non-stationary equilibrium price sequences.

        Unlike the example in Figure 2, a sequence that begins at 𝑝𝑝88∗ or 𝑝𝑝8∗F converges to the

steady-state equilibrium price sequence 𝑝𝑝∗ . It is easy to find examples of OLG models where

there are non-stationary equilibrium prices sequences, like 𝑝𝑝8∗ and 𝑝𝑝F∗ , that obey the market

clearing conditions and remain bounded as 𝑡𝑡 → ∞. All of these sequences are perfect-foresight

equilibrium price sequences and all of them are indeterminate. For any one of these equilibrium

price sequences, there is another one that is arbitrarily close, where closeness of one sequence to

another is measured by the sup norm.

Indeterminacy and Rational Expectations

        The existence of indeterminate equilibrium price sequences in overlapping generations

models is curious; but it might be thought uninteresting. In the examples depicted in Figure 3,

almost all of the equilibria are non-stationary, and all of these non-stationary equilibria converge

to a stationary perfect foresight equilibrium. They appear to explain transitory phenomena that

would never be observed in practice. They are however of considerable practical importance

once one moves beyond the assumption of perfect foresight.

        In rational expectations models, even with a complete set of Arrow securities, there exist

multiple stationary rational expectations equilibria (Farmer & Woodford, 1984). In these

equilibria, prices and allocations fluctuate from one week to the next purely because people

believe that they will. They are examples of equilibria driven by self-fulfilling prophecies, a

phenomenon that can occur in RA models where money is used as a medium of exchange as well

as in OLG models with or without money.




        18
Indeterminacy in Rational Expectations Models with Representative Agents

       The representative agent research school in macroeconomics that developed in the 1980s

was initially restricted to purely real models. This Real Business Cycle (RBC) school added

production to the pure exchange model but preserved the RA assumption. In their (1987) paper

Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey introduced money to the RBC model by assuming that cash

must be held to purchase goods and, following their lead, a large part of the profession adopted

monetary versions of the RBC model to understand the real effects of monetary shocks. Almost

all of the papers in this literature retained assumptions to guarantee that equilibrium is locally

determinate.16

       In monetary RA models with determinate equilibria, money is an appendage that plays no

independent role in driving business cycles. A shock to the money supply or a shock to the

money interest rate, is predicted to feed immediately into the price level, but to have no effect on

economic activity. This property was hard to square with the work of Christopher Sims (1980)

(1989) who found that shocks to the nominal interest rate appear to have big causal effects on

real GDP. The economics profession responded to this fact in two ways.

       The Indeterminacy School developed models where the real effects of monetary shocks

are seen as identifying assumptions that select one of many possible equilibria in a model with

multiple indeterminate dynamic equilibria. In these models, there often exists an equilibrium in

which a shock to the nominal quantity of money influences real GDP in the short run but leads,

in the long run, to higher prices and no long-run impact on real magnitudes. Models with this

property were developed by Farmer and Woodford, (1984), Farmer (1991), Kenneth Matheny

(1998) and Benhabib and Farmer (2000) and are surveyed in Benhabib and Farmer (1999).




       19
        The response from economists working with RA models was different. They continued to

rule out indeterminacy by restricting the parameters of their models to regions of the parameter

space where equilibria are locally determinate. To understand the facts uncovered by Sims they

added the assumption that money prices are ‘sticky’ as a consequence of small costs of price

adjustment.19 This approach, dubbed ‘New-Keynesian Economics’ by N. Gregory Mankiw and

David Romer, (1998), became the mainstream model adopted by central banks to explain the real

effects of monetary policy. The following section summarizes the New Keynesian model.

The Flagship New-Keynesian Model

        The flagship New-Keynesian (NK) model consists of the following three equations,

 [6]                         𝑦𝑦a = 𝔼𝔼a [𝑦𝑦a)8 ] − 𝑎𝑎(𝑖𝑖a − 𝔼𝔼a [𝑝𝑝a)8 − 𝑝𝑝a ]) + 𝜌𝜌 + 𝑢𝑢aj ,

 [7]                                        𝑖𝑖a = 𝜂𝜂l (𝑝𝑝a − 𝑝𝑝am8 ) + 𝑢𝑢an ,

 [8]                         (𝑝𝑝a − 𝑝𝑝am8 ) = 𝛽𝛽𝔼𝔼a [𝑝𝑝a)8 − 𝑝𝑝a ] + 𝜅𝜅(𝑦𝑦a − 𝑦𝑦qa ) + 𝑢𝑢aW .

        Here, 𝑦𝑦a is the log of GDP, 𝑝𝑝a is the log of the price level, 𝑦𝑦qa is the log of potential GDP,

𝑖𝑖a is the short-term money interest rate and 𝑝𝑝a − 𝑝𝑝am8 , is the log difference of the price level. The

log difference of the price level is also, by definition, the date 𝑡𝑡 inflation rate. 𝔼𝔼a [⋅] is the

conditional expectations operator and the symbols 𝑎𝑎, 𝜌𝜌, 𝜂𝜂l 𝛽𝛽 and 𝜅𝜅 are parameters derived from

assumptions about private-sector and government behaviour.20 Equation [6] called an optimizing

IS curve, is derived from the first order intertemporal condition of an optimizing infinitely-lived

representative consumer, Equation [7] is a central-bank reaction function, also referred to as a

Taylor Rule (Taylor, 1999), and Equation [8] is a NK Phillips curve. The terms 𝑢𝑢aj , 𝑢𝑢an and 𝑢𝑢aW

are respectively a demand shock, a policy shock and a supply shock.

        The New Keynesian model can be amended to include the following equation




        20
                                                        x
                                                 𝐵𝐵a
 [9]                                                 = u 𝔔𝔔wa 𝑠𝑠w ,
                                                 𝑃𝑃a
                                                        wya


where 𝐵𝐵a is the dollar value of government debt, 𝑃𝑃a = exp(𝑝𝑝a ) is the price level, 𝔔𝔔wa is the

present value at date 𝑡𝑡, measured in units of date 𝑡𝑡 goods, of a claim to goods at date 𝜏𝜏 and 𝑠𝑠w is

the budget surplus, equal to the real value at date 𝜏𝜏 of government tax revenues net of

expenditure. The present value price, 𝔔𝔔wa , is determined by the interest rates and inflation rates

that hold between periods 𝑡𝑡 and 𝜏𝜏.21

Active and Passive Fiscal and Monetary Policies in the Flagship NK-Model

        Eric Leeper (Leeper, 1991) has suggested the following classification of policies in the

NK-model. If the coefficient 𝜂𝜂l in the Taylor rule is greater than one, monetary policy is said to

be active. If it is less than one, monetary policy is passive. This classification is useful because

one can show that if monetary policy is active, the equilibrium of the NK-model is locally

determinate. The classification of fiscal policies as active or passive requires a little more

explanation.

        If the government were to be treated in the same way as any other actor in a general

equilibrium model, the Treasury would need to ensure that Equation [9] holds for every possible

price level 𝑃𝑃a and every sequence of present value prices {𝔔𝔔wa }x
                                                                  wya . Under this interpretation of


the constraints on feasible fiscal policies, Equation [9] is a government budget constraint. Taking

prices and interest rates as given, the government would need to ensure that it raises enough

revenue to eventually pay off its outstanding debt. If the Treasury does indeed adjust taxes or

expenditure plans, or both, to ensure that it remains solvent for all possible prices and interest

rates, the fiscal policy is said to be 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝. If instead, the government sets the sequence of

surpluses {𝑠𝑠w }x                                    w x
                wya independently of 𝑃𝑃a , 𝐵𝐵a or {𝔔𝔔a }wya , fiscal policy is said to be active.




        21
Equilibrium Determinacy When Monetary Policy is Active and Fiscal Policy is Passive

        When the NK-model was first developed in the 1980s, little attention was paid to fiscal

constraints and it was assumed that fiscal policy is always passive. Like any other actor in a

general equilibrium model, the government was assumed to be a price taker that cannot spend

more than it receives in income. Attention during this period was focused on the possibility that

active monetary policy can select a locally determinate equilibrium by influencing the stability

properties of the steady-state equilibrium of a log-linear NK-model.22

        If one defines 𝑋𝑋a ≡ [𝑖𝑖a , 𝑝𝑝a − 𝑝𝑝am8 , 𝑦𝑦a ]9 , the NK-model is an example of a linear rational

expectations model of the form,

 [10]                                      𝑋𝑋a = 𝐴𝐴𝔼𝔼a [𝑋𝑋a)8 ] + 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑈𝑈a ,

where 𝐶𝐶 is a 3 × 1 vector of constants, 𝐴𝐴 is a 3 × 3 matrix of coefficients and 𝑈𝑈a = [𝑢𝑢aj , 𝑢𝑢an , 𝑢𝑢aW ]9

is a vector of random variables which have zero expected value and are independently and

identically distributed. As long as monetary policy is active, all of the eigenvalues of the matrix

𝐴𝐴 are inside the unit circle and, in this case, the NK-model has the following reduced form

 [11]                                        𝑋𝑋a = (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐴𝐴)m8 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑈𝑈a .

The inflation rate, GDP and the interest rate are all functions only of the shocks, 𝑈𝑈a , and the price

level is pinned down by the definition of inflation in the initial period.

Equilibrium Determinacy When Monetary Policy is Passive and Fiscal Policy is Active

        When monetary policy is passive, as it was in the United States prior to 1979, and again

from 2009 – 2017, the price level is no longer determined by the equations of the NK-model.24

Instead, the price level may fluctuate randomly, driven by the self-fulfilling beliefs of market

participants. To handle this apparent ‘problem’ with NK economics, a number of economists

(Leeper, 1991) (Sims C. A., 1994) (Woodford, 1995) have suggested that, when monetary policy


        22
is passive, government debt will remain bounded even if fiscal policy is active. This idea is

called the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL).

          When fiscal policy is active, the Treasury no longer adjusts its tax and spending plan to

ensure budget balance; instead, Equation [9] determines the price level as a function of the

expected present value of all future surpluses. Equation [9], in this interpretation, is not a budget

constraint, it is a debt valuation equation. According to Leeper’s classification, the price level is

locally determinate if monetary policy is active and fiscal policy is passive, or if monetary policy

is passive and fiscal policy is active.25

          The indeterminacy of the price level in the RA model is a problem, but there is at least a

potential resolution. One can restrict attention to the Central Bank’s preferred steady state and

assume that the policy mix is always a combination of one active and one passive policy. The

following section demonstrates that no such resolution is possible in the OLG model where

indeterminacy of the equilibrium prices and quantities is more pervasive. In an OLG model,

calibrated to U.S. data, monetary and fiscal policy can both be active at the same time and yet

economic fundamentals are insufficient to completely determine either absolute or relative

prices.


Indeterminacy in Rational Expectations Models with Overlapping Generations

          Timothy Kehoe and David Levine (Kehoe & Levine, 1985) compared the differences in

the determinacy properties of RA models and OLG models. They demonstrated that in the OLG

model, equilibria may be generically indeterminate of arbitrary degree.26 It was widely believed

in the 1980s that the Kehoe-Levine result that equilibria in the OLG model are generically

indeterminate had little relevance to practical models of the macroeconomy. As shown in recent

research by Farmer and Zabczyk (2019), that belief is incorrect.


          23
A Calibrated Example of an OLG Model with Indeterminacy

       Farmer and Zabczyk (2019) provide an example of an OLG model in which people live

for 62 periods where the income profile of the people in their model is calibrated to U.S. data

using estimates of Guvenen et. al (2015). The model they present has an indeterminate steady-

state equilibrium where money has value. This property is important because it implies that a

very standard macroeconomic model, when calibrated to actual data, is incapable of uniquely

determining prices and quantities.

       Farmer and Zabczyk assumed initially that monetary policy is passive and fiscal policy is

active. In the NK-model, that combination of policies would result in local determinacy of the

monetary steady-state equilibrium. Instead, they found that their calibrated model displays not

just one, but two-degrees of indeterminacy. One degree of indeterminacy would be sufficient to

invalidate the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. The fact that they find two degrees of

indeterminacy implies that the price level is indeterminate even if monetary and fiscal policy are

both active. These results are extremely damaging to a research agenda that attempts to use

DSGE models to determine the price level as a function of economic fundamentals alone.

       The rational expectations research school, as envisioned by Robert Lucas and Thomas

Sargent, was an attempt to explain expectations in terms of a narrowly defined set of

fundamentals.27 The results of Kehoe-Levine (1985), and the Farmer-Zabczyk (2019) example

throw doubt on the ability of this programme to explain economic facts. The assumption that

equilibrium is unique requires a very strong set of restrictions that are unlikely to be satisfied in

the real world. It follows that preferences, endowments and technologies are insufficient to

explain how prices and quantities are determined in a market economy. We must also ask how

beliefs are formed and how those beliefs independently influence economic outcomes.28



       24
The Implications of Indeterminacy for Theories of Efficient Asset Markets

        A large literature, beginning with Robert Shiller (1981) and Stephen Leroy and Robert

Porter (1981) has found that asset prices fluctuate too much to be explained by subsequent

fluctuations in dividend payments. There must instead, be a substantial movement in the price of

risk.29 Fluctuations in the price of risk are measured, in a rational expectations model, by

variations in the Arrow security prices 𝑄𝑄1 and 𝑄𝑄B in Equation 1. In the RA model, fluctuations

in these prices are sometimes attributed to shocks to constraints on how much agents are allowed

to borrow. In the OLG model they can be fully explained as self-fulfilling prophecies even in a

model where there is a complete set of Arrow securities (Farmer R. E., 2018).

        Eugene Fama (1970) coined the term “efficient markets hypothesis” (EMH) to refer to

the idea that the capital markets reflect all available information and it is not possible, according

to the EMH, to make money by buying and selling securities unless one has insider information.

A large body of empirical evidence suggests that this hypothesis is at least approximately true.

But it has nothing to do with the claim of general equilibrium theorists that markets are Pareto

efficient.

        The efficient markets hypothesis refers to informational efficiency. This is the statement

that there are no riskless arbitrage opportunities and it is a property of any economic model with

a complete set of Arrow securities. The assumption there are complete financial markets may or

may not be a close approximation to the real world.30 Whatever position one takes in the debate

over complete versus incomplete markets, the existence of second-degree indeterminacy in a

calibrated model has serious implications for the proposition that the financial markets efficiently

allocate capital to competing ends. The existence of indeterminate relative prices implies that,




        25
even when the capital markets are complete, they do not efficiently allocate capital to competing

ends. Why might that be?

       In the Farmer and Zabczyk (2019) example, the relative price of goods today for goods

tomorrow is indeterminate, even when the Central Bank and the Treasury each follow active

policies. The individuals that inhabit this model are able to trade with each other and to write

insurance contracts against every event that may occur in subsequent weeks. But each week, a

new set of people arrives in the market. These people are unable to participate in insurance

markets that open before they were born and their actions may differ across states of nature.

       The important point here is that, even when there exists a complete set of Arrow

securities, that fact does not guarantee complete participation in the financial markets because

people have finite lives. This was the main point of the seminal paper by Cass and Shell (1983)

on sunspots. In research that builds on that idea, Farmer (2018) has shown that simple MGE

models generate equilibria where there are substantial asset price fluctuations, and a large risk

premium, even when there is no underlying uncertainty of any kind. Because people are assumed

to be risk averse and these fluctuations are avoidable, they are necessarily Pareto inefficient.


Models of Steady-State Indeterminacy

       The models of dynamic indeterminacy that arise from the OLG structure suffer from the

same deficiencies as the models of dynamic indeterminacy that arise from models of increasing-

returns-to-scale. If the labour market is Walrasian, these models will generate business cycles as

small fluctuations around a socially efficient steady state. That insight suggests that, if one seeks

a micro-foundation for the Keynesian concept of involuntary unemployment, one must consider

models where the quantity of labour traded each period is determined by some mechanism other

than Walrasian market clearing. The following sub-sections elaborates on this theme.


       26
Classical Search Theory as an Alternative Equilibrium Concept

        The Walrasian auctioneer has been widely criticized, not just by non-economists or

economists from outside the field, but also by Kenneth Arrow, a leading general equilibrium

theorist who, along with Gerard Debreu and Lionel McKenzie, was the first to provide a rigorous

mathematical proof of the existence of equilibrium.31 Criticisms of Walrasian equilibrium as a

theory of market prices and quantities led to the development of a variety of alternative

equilibrium concepts including quantity-constrained equilibrium, asymmetric information

equilibrium, contract theory and search equilibrium. This article is limited by space

considerations to a discussion of just one of these alternative concepts, search equilibrium.

        In 1973 Edmund Phelps co-edited an influential volume of articles The Microeconomic

Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory (Phelps, 1972) which contained two of the first

articles on the economics of search unemployment (Alchian, 1969) (Mortensen, 1972). These

papers were precursors to the development of a large literature that Farmer (2016, p. 77) has

referred to as Classical Search Theory. Classical search theory was further developed by Peter

Diamond (1982) and Christopher Pissarides (1979) and in 2010, Diamond, Mortensen and

Pissarides were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics “for their analysis of markets with search

frictions”.

        Classical Search Theory is an alternative equilibrium concept, distinct from Walrasian

equilibrium. It sees the labour market as a dynamic changing environment where people are

constantly moving between the states of employment and unemployment. One could envisage a

Walrasian model where unemployed individuals must allocate time between searching for a job

or enjoying leisure and where firms must allocate the time of their workers between filling

vacancies or producing goods. In a Walrasian equilibrium, the auctioneer would steer the



        27
economy towards an outcome in which unemployed and employed members of the labour force

were each optimally allocating their time between these alternative activities.

         Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides envisage a different mechanism from Walrasian

equilibrium to decide what happens each week. Instead of an auctioneer who sets prices,

unemployed workers bump randomly into firms with vacant jobs. In a Walrasian market, search

by an unemployed worker for a job, and search by a corporate recruiter for a worker, are distinct

activities that would be associated with different prices. Instead, in search theory, there are not

enough relative prices and, as a consequence, the labour market is incomplete and the

equilibrium unemployment rate is indeterminate.

         If an unemployed worker meets a firm with a vacancy, the firm is willing to pay any

wage less than or equal to the worker’s marginal product. The worker is willing to accept any

wage greater than or equal to her reservation wage. To resolve this indeterminacy Classical

Search Theory introduces a new parameter, the bargaining weight, which picks a wage

somewhere between the worker’s marginal product and the firm’s reservation wage. Unless the

bargaining weight takes a very specific value, the Classical Search Theory equilibrium will not

coincide with a social optimum and there may be too much or too little unemployment (Hosios,

1990).

Keynesian Search Theory as an Alternative Equilibrium Concept

         The Indeterminacy School, uses a different approach to resolve the indeterminacy of

search equilibrium. Farmer (2016, p. 77) calls this alternative Keynesian Search Theory. 32

Instead of assuming that firms bargain with workers, Keynesian Search Theory assumes that

firms employ enough workers to produce the quantity of goods demanded by consumers. This

quantity depends on consumers’ wealth which is itself determined by the value of their assets.



         28
Farmer posits that asset market participants form beliefs about the price of shares in the stock

market and that, in equilibrium, these beliefs are validated by the actions of future asset market

participants.

       In the data, there is a strong correlation between unemployment and the stock market.33

If Classical Search Theory is correct, movements in the stock market are caused by the rational

expectations of market participants that there will be future movements in fundamentals. For

example, a future court decision might give unions more power and increase the bargaining

power of workers. If Keynesian Search Theory is correct, the direction of causation is reversed.

It is not movements in the bargaining weight that cause movements in the unemployment rate

and consequent movements in asset prices. It is movements in self-fulfilling beliefs about asset

prices that cause variations in demand and subsequent variations in employment. The bargaining

weight, in this interpretation of the facts, is endogenous.

Keynesian Search Theory and Indeterminacy in Macroeconomics

       Models with dynamic indeterminacy have similar implications for fiscal and monetary

policy to those of classical and NK DSGE models. Markets, left to themselves, may misallocate

resources; but these misallocations are not of the orders of magnitude that characterize real-

world financial crises. In contrast, the shift from Walrasian equilibrium to Keynesian search

equilibrium is a far more plausible candidate for a micro-founded theory of major recessions.

       In Keynesian Search Theory, if asset market participants stubbornly persist in believing

that the stock market has low value, those beliefs will be associated with a permanently elevated

unemployment rate. The indeterminacy of equilibrium is not confined to many dynamic paths

converging on an approximately efficient steady state. Instead, in Keynesian Search Theory




       29
pessimistic expectations can steer the economy into one of many low-level equilibrium traps in

which there is a permanently elevated unemployment rate.

       The theoretical difference between models with an isolated determinate steady-state

equilibrium, and models with a continuum of contiguous steady state equilibria, has important

implications for the time series properties of data. If beliefs about the value of the stock market

can wander randomly, as they do in real world data, so can the unemployment rate. Keynesian

Search Theory predicts that persistent low-frequency movements in the stock market cause

persistent low-frequency movements in the unemployment rate.

The Stock Market and the Unemployment Rate

       The theoretical possibilities thrown up by Keynesian Search Theory are consistent with

the behaviour of unemployment and asset prices that we see in data. Figure 4 shows that there

was a close connection between the stock market and the unemployment rate during the Great

Depression and in the years up to the start of WWII. If the labour market is Walrasian, the mass

unemployment associated with the Great Depression must be explained by a shift in the

preference for leisure. Or as Modigliani quipped, the Great Depression was a ‘sudden attack of

contagious laziness’.36 This seems implausible.

       The connection of the unemployment rate to the stock market documented in Figure 4 is

not an experience confined to the Great Depression in the U.S. It is a universal connection that

holds in post WWII U.S. data, (Farmer R. E., 2012b), (2015) German data, (Fritsche &

Pierdzioch, 2016), and in a panel of industrialized and non-industrialized countries (Pan, 2018).

In all of the studies cited above, researchers have provided support for the finding that the

unemployment rate and the stock market are co-integrated random walks 38 Unemployment and




       30
the real value of assets each wander randomly but they do not wander too far from each other.

The Keynesian version of search theory explains these facts as movements among a continuum

of possible steady-state equilibria, caused by self-fulfilling shifts in beliefs.

Keynesian Economics Without the Phillips Curve

        This article has reviewed models that display dynamic and steady-state indeterminacy but

as macroeconomists are fond of saying ‘it takes a model to beat a model’.39 The three equation

NK-model has been used as a vehicle to understand how the interest rate, the inflation rate and

real GDP are related to each other. How might that model be amended if one accepts the

Indeterminacy School in Macroeconomics? In two recent papers, Farmer and Nicolò (2018)

(2019) answer that question. They run a horse race of the three-equation NK-model, closed with

the Phillips curve, against an alternative Farmer Monetary FM-model, that replaces the New-


        31
Keynesian Phillips Curve with a parameterized belief function. This alternative model retains

equations [6] and [7] but replaces equation [8] with

 [8𝑎𝑎]                                     𝔼𝔼a [𝑥𝑥a)8 ] = 𝑥𝑥a + 𝑢𝑢aW ,

where 𝑥𝑥a = (𝑦𝑦a + 𝑝𝑝a ) − (𝑦𝑦am8 + 𝑝𝑝am8 ) is the growth rate of nominal GDP. This equation is an

example of beliefs as a new fundamental. The belief function, modelled in Equation [8a],

captures the idea that people expect nominal income growth next year to equal nominal income

growth this year. The model, closed in this way, allows beliefs to wander randomly and its

reduced form representation is a system of random walks in which inflation, the money interest

rate and the deviation of GDP from potential exhibit non-stationary but cointegrated behaviour.

The FM-Model displays dynamic indeterminacy. This feature allows it to capture the fact that

prices are sticky in the data. And it displays steady-state indeterminacy. This feature allows it to

capture the fact that the unemployment rate is highly persistent and cointegrated with nominal

GDP growth, a proxy for movements in real wealth.

         The NK-model assumes that the steady-state equilibrium is determinate. The FM-model

allows the steady-state equilibrium to be indeterminate. To understand which model better

explains the data, Farmer and Nicolò use Bayesian statistics to compare the posterior odds ratios

of the two models. The reduced form of the NK-model is a stationary vector autoregression. The

reduced form of the FM-model is a non-stationary vector error correction model. The NK-model

restricts the data to be stationary. The FM model allows the data to be non-stationary but

cointegrated. Farmer and Nicolò show that in U.S., U.K. and Canadian data, the posterior odds

ratio favour the FM-model by a large margin. It takes a model to beat a model. And the

Indeterminacy School wins the day by a decisive margin.

Notes


         1
             I would like to thank Kenneth Kuttner for suggesting that I write this survey of the Indeterminacy School
in Macroeconomics. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Kazuo Nishimura and Makoto Yano, editors
of the International Journal of Economic Theory, and to Costas Azariadis, Jess Benhabib and all those who
contributed to a newly published Festschrift in honour of my contributions to economics including my body of work
on Indeterminacy in Macroeconomics (IJET Vol 15 No. 1, 2019). Thanks also to two reviewers and to Jean Philippe
Bouchaud for their comments on a first draft of this article and especially to C. Roxanne Farmer for helpful
suggestions.
          2
             Costas Azariadis (1981), used the term ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ to describe this idea. Farmer and
Woodford (1984) extended the concept to examples of the kind of equilibria discussed in this survey in which
equilibria are randomizations across indeterminate sequences of perfect foresight equilibria. Shell (1977) and Cass
and Shell (1983) refer to the phenomena of random allocations driven solely by beliefs as sunspots. In Paris, Jean
Michel Grandmont (1985) was working on endogenous cycles and Roger Guesnerie collaborated with Azariadis to
explore the relationship between sunspots and cycles (Azariadis & Guesnerie, 1986). Other early models that studied
self-fulfilling beliefs in overlapping generations models include papers by Stephen Spear (1984) and Spear and
Sanjay Srivistava (1986). Farmer’s (1993) graduate textbook summarizes these ideas.
          4
             The initial work on models with increasing-returns-to-scale, (Benhabib & Farmer, 1994) (Farmer & Guo,
1994) was criticized for assuming a degree of increasing returns that some considered unrealistic. In a response to
the critics, Yi Wen (1998) showed that by assuming that capital utilization is variable over the business cycle, the
increasing-returns explanation of endogenous fluctuations is fully consistent with empirical evidence.
          5
             See Farmer (2014) for an elaboration of this point.
          6
             It would be possible for models with increasing returns-to-scale to have very different welfare
implications from RBC models, but in practice the welfare losses that occur in these models are small. The fact that
welfare losses are small in many business cycle models was pointed out by Robert Lucas in (1987) in his book
Models of Business Cycles, and updated in an article in (2003) in the American Economic Review to reflect a new
generation of models that include incomplete markets and possibly sticky prices. Welfare losses are small in models
of dynamic indeterminacy, as they are in RBC models, because both kinds of models generate fluctuations around a
socially efficient steady state in which the demand and supply of labour are always equal.
          7
             See (Farmer R. E., 2016) and the references therein. Papers that rely on static indeterminacy include
(Farmer R. E., 2008) (2010) (Gelain & Guerrazzi, 2010) (Guerrazzi, 2011) (2012) (Farmer R. E., 2012a) (2013)
(Farmer & Nicolò, 2018) (2019), (Plotnikov, 2019) and (Farmer & Platonov, 2019). This literature is discussed in
(De Vroey, 2016)
          8
             For an introduction to the history of these ideas, see Farmer (2010, p. 68).

              See Kehoe and Levine (1985) for a proof of this assertion and a discussion of the difference between
these two classes of model.
          11
              An allocation is Pareto optimal, named after the Italian scholar Vilfredo Pareto, if there is no way of
reorganizing the social allocation of commodities to make at least one person better off without simultaneously
making someone else worse off.
          12
              Following the publication of Samuelson’s paper on the OLG model (Samuelson, 1958) it was widely
believed the difference between RA and OLG models was a consequence of the different timing assumptions. Karl
Shell (1971) showed that even if everyone who will ever be born can participate in a market at the beginning of
time, the OLG model still leads to inefficient equilibria.
          13
              Hicks, (1939) provides the first developed account of TE theory. Later developments include Patinkin
(1956) Roy Radner (1972) and Jean Michel Grandmont (1977). Although for Hicks, a period was a week, there is
nothing special about that length of time and more commonly, the period of the of a TE model is identified with the
period of data availability which is often a quarter or a year.

transpose of 𝑥𝑥.

              The space of non-negative bounded sequences is defined as 𝔅𝔅 ≡ {{𝑝𝑝a }x     ay8 | 𝑝𝑝a ∈ ℝ) , 𝑝𝑝a ≤ 1, for all 𝑡𝑡}.

              The assumptions required to generate this result are strong; for example, the uniqueness result does not
survive the introduction of inflationary finance to pay for budget deficits. It has been known at least since the work



         43
of William Brock (1974) that MGE models have at least two steady states and one of these steady states is
generically indeterminate.

            Although there have been attempts to deal with dynamic indeterminacy in estimated NK-models, notably
work by Thomas Lubik and Frank Schorfheide, (2004), the core model still adopts a menu-cost approach to sticky
prices and, whenever possible, introduces assumptions to render a single stationary equilibrium locally unique.
Farmer, Vadim Khramov and Giovanni Nicolò (2015) and Francesco Bianchi and Nicolò (2017) provide methods to
solve and estimate indeterminate GE models with indeterminate equilibria using standard software packages.

            It will be assumed, for the purpose of exposition, that 𝑦𝑦qa is constant. The model is easily adapted to allow
for growth in potential output.

              Monetary general equilibrium models assumed initially that the Central Bank adopts a money supply rule
in which the quantity of money grows at a fixed rate. This, for example, is the assumption in Brock (1974). In part,
this assumption was motivated by the fact that monetary models where the Central Bank pegs the money interest
rate lead to price level indeterminacy (Sargent & Wallace, 1975). Since central banks appear to use the interest rate
as their main instrument to influence the economy, the assumption that the central bank sets a money growth target
was problematic for attempts to build a realistic monetary theory. McCallum (1981) showed that determinacy of the
price level is restored if the Central Bank adjusts the interest rate aggressively enough in response to inflation where
‘aggressively enough’ is defined as an interest rate response coefficient, 𝜂𝜂l , greater than 1.
           24
              Thomas Lubik and Frank Schorfheide (2004) show in an estimated GE model that policy was passive
before 1979 and active afterwards. The period from 2009 to 2017 is characterized by an interest rate peg at,
effectively, zero.
           25
               To some, the classification into active and passive rules may appear natural; to others, it may appear
artificial. Whatever one’s view of the elegance of the theory, it is not sufficient to determine the price level globally,
even in the NK-model with the correct combination of active and passive policies. Jess Benhabib, Stephanie
Schmidt-Grohé and Martín Uribe (2001) pointed out that a linear Taylor Rule is inconsistent with the existence of
the fact that the nominal interest rate cannot be negative. When the model is amended to allow the Taylor Rule to
respect the zero-lower bound, the model always has at least two steady-state equilibria. If the Taylor Rule is active at
the steady state that the Central Bank prefers, there will always exist a second steady state with a low and possibly
negative real interest rate at which the Taylor Rule is passive and the initial price level is indeterminate.
           26
              Kehoe-Levine’s work was largely ignored by macroeconomists. This was due, in part, to resistance from
leading figures in the development of the rational expectations school who advocated for a research agenda in which
expectations are endogenously determined by preferences, endowments and technology (Cherrier & Saïdi, 2018).
           27
              See the agenda described by Robert Lucas and Thomas J. Sargent in their essay, “After Keynesian
Macroeconomics”, (Lucas, Jr. & Sargent, 1981).
           28
               To resolve the indeterminacy problem in MGE models, Farmer (1993) suggested the introduction of a
new independent equation to characterize the way people form their beliefs about future variables. That approach
has been shown empirically to outperform the NK-model, (Farmer & Nicolò, 2018) (2019).
           29
              This was the message that John Cochrane pushed home in his Presidential Address to the American
Finance Association (Cochrane, 2011).

              Some economists point to the costs of establishing contingent markets. They argue that it is pure fiction
to think that real world financial markets are complete, and they study economic models with fewer Arrow securities
than states of nature. Others argue that the world is well approximated by the complete-markets assumption. In their
view, a large divergence from complete markets would create a big incentive for an arbitrager to create a new
security.

              The term “Keynesian Search Theory” was coined by Farmer (Farmer R. E., 2016, p. 77) to differentiate it
from classical search models closed with Nash Bargaining. Related papers that use this approach include Farmer,
(2010), (Gelain & Guerrazzi, 2010), (Guerrazzi, 2011), (Guerrazzi, 2012), (Farmer R. E., 2012a), (2013) and
(Williamson, 2015). In earlier work, Farmer (Farmer R. E., 2008) referred to models where the labour market is
closed by Keynesian Search Theory as ‘Old-Keynesian economics’. Farmer (2010), Chapter 6, uses the Keynesian
Search Model to understand the Great Depression.

            The unemployment rate cannot be an exact random walk as it is bounded between 0 and 1. The papers
cited here apply a logistic transformation that maps the unemployment rate into the real line. It is the transformed
unemployment rate that passes non-stationarity tests in data.
