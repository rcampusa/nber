The Effects of Investing Social Security Funds in the Stock Market
When Fixed Costs Prevent Some Households from Holding Stocks

                                           ABSTRACT

       With fixed costs of participating in the stock market, consumers with high income will
participate in the stock market, but consumers with lower income will not participate. If a fully-
funded defined-contribution social security system tries to exploit the equity premium by selling a
dollar of bonds per capita and buying a dollar of equity per capita, consumers who save but do not
participate in the stock market will increase their consumption, thereby reducing saving and capital
accumulation. Calibration of a general equilibrium model indicates that this policy could reduce the
aggregate capital stock substantially, by about 50 cents per capita.

        The Social Security system in the United States currently runs a surplus of $100

billion per year, which is used to buy bonds that are held in the Social Security Trust

Fund. The value of this trust fund is projected to grow to more than $2.3 trillion 1999

dollars in the year 2015. However, as the baby boom generation retires and collects

social security benefits, the trust fund will be drawn down until it is exhausted in 2034.1

        Various sorts of policies could delay, perhaps indefinitely, the date at which the

trust fund is exhausted. Social security taxes could be increased by increasing payroll tax

rates or increasing the retirement age, and future benefits could be reduced explicitly or

more subtly by changing the calculation of the CPI, taxing future benefits more heavily,

increasing the retirement age, or adopting means testing. However, policies to increase

social security taxes are opposed by workers, and policies to reduce social security

benefits are opposed by social security beneficiaries, both current and future. A third type

of policy that neither directly increases taxes nor reduces benefits is to try to earn a higher

rate of return on the Social Security Trust Fund by taking advantage of the equity

premium on stocks relative to bonds. Historically, the rate of return on stocks has

exceeded the rate of return on short-term riskless bills by an average of about 6% per

year. The prospect of earning a higher rate of return on even a fraction of the huge Social

Security Trust Fund has generated a variety of proposals to invest some of the trust fund

in equity.

        Some economists have argued that investing part of the Social Security Trust

Fund in equity is simply a rearrangement of paper assets without any real allocational

effects, and they have described such a policy as a “shell game.” The shell game

argument is similar to the Ricardian equivalence proposition in public finance and

macroeconomics and the Modigliani-Miller theorem in corporate finance. The argument

is that private investors will react to any rearrangement of the social security system’s

portfolio in a way that completely neutralizes the effect of the portfolio change. For

example, if the social security system sells a dollar of bonds and purchases a dollar of

equity, private investors would buy a dollar of bonds and sell a dollar of equity. There

would be no effect on asset prices or on the integrated portfolio of the private sector and

the social security system. Like the Ricardian Equivalence proposition and the

Modigliani-Miller theorem, the shell game argument is based on a set of assumptions

about optimizing behavior and perfect markets. The shell game argument assumes that

all consumers participate in the markets for bonds and equity, and their holdings of these

assets are at interior optima. However, the argument breaks down, and changing the

portfolio of the social security system is not a shell game if, as is indeed true, some

consumers save, but do not participate in the stock market.

       The 6% average annual equity premium and widespread non-participation in the

stock market are two aspects of the equity premium puzzle that was first exposited by

Mehra and Prescott (1985). Mehra and Prescott showed that a prototypical asset-pricing

model could not explain an equity premium larger than 35 basis points per year using

conventional values for preference parameters. They coined the term “equity premium

puzzle” to describe the fact that the historical average equity premium greatly exceeds the

equity premium that can be explained by conventional models. Though much of the

subsequent study of the equity premium puzzle has focused on this high equity premium,


                                              2
another aspect of the puzzle, highlighted by Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), is that a majority

of consumers do not own any stocks, despite the large average reward to owning stocks.

       Although the 6% average equity premium is the aspect of the equity premium

puzzle that has attracted the attention of policy makers trying to preserve the solvency of

the social security system, the widespread non-participation in the stock market is the

important aspect for addressing the shell game issue. In this paper, I develop and analyze

a general equilibrium overlapping-generations model with fixed costs of participating in

the stock market and with a constraint that prevents young consumers from borrowing to

finance consumption. In addition, I introduce intra-cohort heterogeneity in earnings. The

fixed costs, together with the heterogeneity, generate an equilibrium in which high-

income consumers find it beneficial to pay the fixed cost and to participate in the stock

market, while middle-income and low-income consumers do not participate in the stock

market. Young middle-income consumers save some of their current income and hold

riskless bonds. Young low-income consumers are prevented from borrowing by a

binding borrowing constraint and consume all of their available resources.

       Because middle-income and low-income consumers do not directly own equity,

they cannot offset the change in the portfolio of the social security system when it sells

bonds and buys equity. Thus, the standard argument underlying the shell game result

does not hold in this model. For the cases analyzed in Sections V and VI of this paper,

this change in the portfolio of the social security system reduces the nation’s capital

stock, despite the fact that the social security system increases (from an initial value of

zero) its holding of capital. The reduction in the aggregate capital stock is the result of an

income effect on middle-income consumers. These consumers benefit from an increase


                                              3
in the expected present value of lifetime resources when the social security system holds

some equity instead of lower-yielding bonds. In response to this increase in lifetime

resources, these consumers increase their consumption, thereby reducing national saving

and national capital accumulation. Low-income consumers, however, do not have the

resources to increase their consumption when they are young, and thus their consumption

when young is unchanged by the change in the portfolio of the social security system.

        It is interesting to compare these results to those by Diamond and Geanakoplos

(1999), hereafter D-G, who present a model in which the aggregate capital stock

increases when the social security trust fund sells bonds in exchange for risky capital.

The D-G model has two classes of consumers, corresponding to the low-income and

high-income consumers in the model I present here. By ignoring consumers who save but

do not participate in the stock market (middle-income consumers in the current model),

D-G eliminate the income effect that drives the results in the current model. Instead, they

focus on the interest rate effects on aggregate saving. As in the current paper, D-G find

that the change in the portfolio of the social security system increases the equilibrium

riskless interest rate. In the current paper, with logarithmic preferences, the interest rate

has no effect on aggregate saving, but D-G use a class of preferences for which an

increase in the interest rate increases saving. Since the D-G model does not have middle-

income consumers, through whom the income effect operates, the interest rate effect on

aggregate saving determines the effect on the aggregate capital stock.2


2
 Though the D-G model incorporates an interest rate effect on saving, the model in the current paper has
several advantages relative to the D-G model. The model in the current paper has three classes of
consumers, which include the two classes in D-G, and the empirically important class of consumers who
save but do not own stock. Membership in these classes is determined endogenously in the current model,
but is exogenous in D-G. All consumers participate in the social security system in the current model, but


                                                     4
        The presentation of the model begins in Section I with a description of the

production function and resulting factor prices. The production function is consistent

with endogenous growth and has the implication that the rate of return to risky capital,

which is traded in the stock market, is random and independent of the amount of risky

capital. The decisions of individual consumers are examined in Section II. Consumers

choose how much to consume when young and they decide how to allocate their

portfolios to stocks and bonds. The portfolio decision includes a decision about whether

to incur the fixed cost necessary to participate in the stock market. After deriving the

demands for bonds and stocks by individuals in Section II, I discuss equilibrium in these

markets in Section III.

        I begin analyzing the effect of having the social security system sell bonds and

buy equity in Section IV. In order to focus sharply on the question of the effect of the

social security system’s portfolio, I analyze a fully-funded defined-contribution social

security system that initially holds only bonds. I present an expression in Section IV for

the effect on the aggregate capital stock of a small change in the social security system’s

portfolio. This expression is the sum of two effects. The first effect reduces the

aggregate capital stock because of the income effect on middle-income consumers

described above. The second effect reflects the behavior of “switchers” who would hold

stock in the initial situation, but who would not participate in the stock market if the

social security system holds some stock in its portfolio. With the formulation of fixed



only the class of non-saving workers participate in social security in D-G. All consumers choose
consumption based on explicit optimization in the current model, but in D-G, workers are assumed to be
non-savers. Specifically, D-G assumes that workers set consumption when young equal to after-tax wage
income when young. The model in the current paper is easily calibrated, but the D-G model needs
additional assumptions to make it amenable to calibration.


                                                   5
costs in this model, switchers respond to the avoidance of fixed costs by increasing their

saving. Beginning in Section V, I ignore switchers and show that the change in the

portfolio of the social security system reduces the aggregate capital stock, increases the

riskless interest rate, and increases the maximized expected utility of all young

consumers. However, the increase in the utility of young consumers, who are the current

workers, is achieved at least partly at the expense of future workers and taxpayers. In

Section VI, I present numerical estimates of the reduction in the aggregate capital stock,

and show that this reduction can be substantial. I present concluding remarks in Section

VII.


                            I. Production and Factor Prices


       The economy is populated by overlapping generations of consumers who live for

two periods. Consumers are endowed with n > 0 effective units of labor when they are

young, and they supply this labor inelastically. Old consumers do not work. There is

intra-generational heterogeneity in the amount of effective units of labor per young

consumer. Let G(x) be the measure of workers with n < x. Suppose that G(x) is

differentiable for x > 0, and adopt the normalizations G(f) = 1 and

                      II. The Decisions of Individual Consumers


        There is a continuum of young consumers indexed by n, the endowment of

effective units of labor. I will show in this section that the optimal consumption and

portfolio decisions of a young consumer assign that consumer to one of three groups.

Young consumers who save some of their disposable income and participate in the stock

market are assigned to group H. Young consumers who save some of their disposable

income but do not participate in the stock market are assigned to group M, and young

consumers who consume all of their disposable income and do not participate in the stock

market are assigned to group L. I will show that group H consists of high-income

consumers, group M consists of middle-income consumers, and group L consists of low-

income consumers.

        A young consumer endowed with n effective units of labor earns labor income of

wn where w is the wage rate in equation (7). Each young consumer pays a tax T. Old

consumers do not earn labor income, but receive benefits from a fully-funded defined-

contribution social security system. Specifically, the social security system invests Tb > 0

in riskless bonds and Tk > 0 in risky capital on behalf of each young consumer. When

these consumers are old, they receive social security benefits of Tbr + TkR where r > 0 is


                                             8
the (gross) rate of return on riskless bonds and R > 0 is the (gross) rate of return on risky

capital in equation (6).

       Each consumer must decide how much to save when young and how to allocate

this saving between riskless bonds and risky capital, subject to a borrowing constraint that

prevents young consumers from borrowing to finance consumption. There are no

transactions costs associated with investing in riskless bonds, but there is a fixed cost of

participating in the stock market, where the claims to risky capital are traded. I will

model this fixed cost to include both a resource cost and a utility cost, but either type of

cost alone is sufficient for the results in this paper. The resource cost is a fixed amount

F1 > 0 that must be paid when young in order to participate in the stock market. The

utility cost will be described below when the utility function is introduced.

       Having described all of the opportunities facing a consumer, I will present the

budget constraint more formally. After consuming an amount c, a young consumer has

private saving of s { wn  T  GF1  c , where G is a dummy variable that equals one if the

consumer participates in the stock market, and equals 0 otherwise. Part of this saving is

used to purchase risky capital, k, in the stock market and the remainder, s – k, is used to

purchase riskless bonds. Let b { s  k  T b denote the amount of riskless bonds held,

both directly and indirectly through the social security system, by a young consumer, and

let h { k  T k be the amount of risky capital held, both directly and indirectly. Define a

{ b + h as the total value of the assets held directly and indirectly. Using the definition of

s yields


                                 a {bh     :  GF1  c ,                                 (8a)

is the value of wealth owned, both directly and indirectly, by the consumer when young.4

         An old consumer consumes all available resources, which consist of br, the

principal and interest on both direct and indirect holdings of riskless bonds, and hR, the

gross value of risky capital held both directly and indirectly. Letting x denote

consumption when old yields


                                             x = br + hR.                                                     (9)


         The utility function is5

where F2 > 0 is a utility cost of participating in the stock market. The consumer can

avoid this cost by not participating in the stock market, thereby setting G = 0. As

mentioned above, either F1 or F2 can be zero, but F1 + F2 > 0.




4
  The borrowing constraint prevents consumption when young from exceeding disposable income, wn – T.
The present value of the claim on future social security benefits, Tb + Tk, is part of total wealth, :, but is not
part of disposable income, wn - T.

  The quantitative results in Table 2 below would be unchanged if the utility function in equation (10) were
replaced by the more general utility function U ln c  GF2  E ln E x1I , which, like the utility

function in equation (10) has an intertemporal elasticity of substitution equal to one. However, the more
general utility function presented here has a constant coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to I, whereas
the utility function in equation (10) has a coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to one. With the more
general utility function, the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth (when the borrowing constraint is
not binding) equals 1/(1+E) when Tk = 0, just as for the utility function in equation (10).

         A consumer who participates in the stock market chooses current consumption c,

bonds b, and risky capital h, to maximize the utility function in equation (10) subject to

the constraints in equations (8) and (9).6 Equivalently, the consumer chooses a, the total

amount of assets held directly and indirectly, and J { h/a, the share of the total assets held

in risky capital. Recognizing that b = (1-J)a and h = Ja, substitute equations (8) and (9)

into the utility function in equation (10), with G = 1, to obtain

Equation (12) shows that the optimal size of the portfolio, a { b+h, consisting of both

direct and indirect holdings, is independent of the rates of return on the riskless and risky

  I have assumed that the social security parameters Tb and Tk and the fixed costs F1 and F2 are such that the
borrowing constraint is not binding for consumers who choose to participate in the stock market. See
footnote 16.

assets, and is proportional to wealth, :, adjusted for the fixed costs of participating in the

stock market. The fixed cost F1 is a resource cost and is directly subtracted from first-

period resources, thereby reducing the optimal size of the portfolio. The fixed cost F2 is a

utility cost and hence does not directly reduce resources. However, an increase in F2

reduces the optimal size of the portfolio because an increase in F2 increases the marginal

utility of consumption when young, and therefore shifts consumption away from old age

toward youth.7

           Now consider the optimal allocation of the portfolio. The first-order condition for

J is obtained by differentiating the maximand in equation (11a) with respect to J, setting

the derivative equal to zero, and solving to obtain

Equation (13) implicitly defines the optimal equity share J(r) as a function of the riskless

interest rate r, given the distribution of the risky rate of return on capital R. It is

straightforward to show that8 J’(r) < 0 and that9 J(r) has the same sign as the (ex ante)

  However, if fixed costs involve a reduction in utility when old as well as a reduction in utility when young,
they could increase the optimal size of the portfolio. For example, if the utility function is

costs reduce optimal total assets. However, if F1 + F2 – F3/(Er) < 0, fixed costs increase optimal total
assets. The optimal total amount of assets is unaffected by the fixed costs in the special case with (1) no
resource costs of participation (F1 = 0); (2) F2 = F3; and (3) Er = 1.

  Since Z(J, r) is strictly decreasing in J (see equation (*) in footnote 8) and Z(0,r) = E{R-r}/r has the same

        Equation (17a) shows that an increase in lifetime resources : increases the

maximized value of utility. Whether an increase in the riskless rate r increases or

decreases maximized utility depends on whether the consumer would choose a long or a

short position in bonds. As shown in equation (17b), a consumer who would choose a

long position in bonds (1-J> 0), and thus would be a recipient of interest, benefits from

an increase in r; a consumer who would choose a short position in bonds (1-J< 0),10 and

thus would be a payer of interest, suffers a loss in utility when the interest rate on bonds

increases. Equation (17c) shows that a change in Tk that leaves : unchanged has no

effect on the maximized value of utility. For instance, an increase in Tk accompanied by

an equal decrease in Tb leaves : unchanged and, according to equation (17c), has no

effect on the maximized value of utility.

  The borrowing constraint does not allow the consumer to borrow to finance consumption, but does permit
borrowing to finance the holding of capital, so J(r) could exceed one.

               II.B. Savers Who Do Not Participate in the Stock Market


        For a consumer who does not participate in the stock market, the direct holding of

risky capital, k, is zero, and thus the total (indirect) holding of risky capital is h = Tk. By

not participating in the stock market, this consumer avoids the resource cost F1 and the

utility cost F2. In this subsection, I focus on consumers who do not participate in the

stock market, but who choose to consume less than their disposable income, wn – T.

Such consumers choose b to maximize the utility function in equation (10) with G = 0 and

subject to the constraints in equations (8) and (9) with h set equal to the parameter Tk.

The decision problem can be written as


                               b                    g
                     maxb ln :  T k  b  EE ln br  T k R .mb        gr                         (18)

where the inequality in equation (20) follows from the fact that the equity premium,

E{R}–r, is positive.

       The optimal holding of bonds by a saver who does not participate in the stock

market is particularly simple in the case in which the social security system does not hold

any equity. Formally, this case is represented by Tk = 0, and equation (19) shows that in

this case, the optimal holding of bonds is proportional to wealth, :, and is independent of

the riskless interest rate, r. Thus, a one-dollar increase in wealth, :, increases optimal

bond holding by E/(1+E).

       To interpret the partial derivative in equation (20) it is important to observe that

wealth, : is held fixed when Tk is changed. Suppose, for the moment that the expected

rate of return on risky capital, E{R}, equals the riskless rate r. In this case, equation (20)

indicates that a one-dollar increase in Tk, accompanied by a one-dollar decrease in Tb to

keep : unchanged, reduces the optimal bond holding by one dollar so that the total size

of the portfolio is unchanged. Now suppose that the expected rate of return on risky

capital exceeds the riskless rate. In this case, a one-dollar increase in Tk accompanied by

a one-dollar decrease in Tb has a positive income effect that stimulates consumption and

reduces the size of the consumer’s portfolio. More precisely, this change in Tk and Tb

effectively increases the consumer’s expected second-period resources by the equity

premium, E{R}- r, which has a present value of [E{R} - r]/r. Since the marginal

propensity to consume when young is 1/(1+E), consumption increases by 'cM {

[1/(1+E)][E{R} - r]/r, and the total portfolio falls by 'cM. Since the consumer’s (indirect)




                                              16
holding of equity increases by one dollar, the fall in the consumer’s holding of bonds is 1

+'cM = 1 + [1/(1+E)][E{R} - r]/r, as shown in equation (20).

       Let VM(:, r, Tk) denote the maximized value of the utility function for a saver

who does not participate in the stock market. Substituting the optimal value of b from

equation (19) into equation (18) and simplifying yields

       An increase in wealth, :, increases the maximized value of utility as shown in

equation (22a). Because a saver who does not hold any risky capital, either directly or

indirectly, has a long position in bonds, an increase in the riskless interest rate r increases

the maximized value of utility as shown in equation (22b).

differentiate equation (18) with respect to Tk and evaluate the resulting derivative at b =

       A one-dollar increase in Tk, accompanied by a one-dollar decrease in Tb, which

keeps : constant, increases the expected present value of lifetime resources by [E{R} –

r]/r dollars. Multiplying this increase in expected present value by the effect of : on VM

shown in equation (22a) yields the effect on the maximized value of utility shown in

equation (23).


                             II.C. The Participation Decision


       For young consumers who save some of their disposable income, an important

decision is whether to participate in the stock market. If the benefit of participating in the

stock market outweighs the fixed cost of participation, then the consumer will participate.

Otherwise the consumer will not directly hold any risky capital. To make this decision, a

saver must compare VH(:, r, Tk), which is the maximized value of utility if the consumer

participates in the stock market, with VM(:, r, Tk), which is the maximized value of utility

if the consumer does not participate in the stock market. Define


                            b        g      b         g     b         g

       If D(:, r, Tk) > 0, the consumer will choose to participate in the stock market, and

if D(:, r, Tk) < 0 the consumer will choose not to participate in the stock market. If D(:,

r, Tk) = 0, the consumer will be indifferent about participating in this market.

unique critical value of n, call it n , that separates young participants in the stock market

and young non-participants. It follows from the definition of : in equation (8b) that

         As shown in equation (30), a switcher who chooses not to participate in the stock

market has a larger total portfolio in the first period than a switcher who chooses to

participate in the stock market. By not participating in the stock market, the switcher

avoids the fixed cost F1 + F2 and therefore increases the total value of the first-period

portfolio by [E/(1+E)](F1+F2). Of course, in terms of utility, the avoidance of the fixed

cost F1+F2, which increases the size of the portfolio, is offset by the fact that the rate of

return on the portfolio is lower when the switcher has no direct holding of risky capital

than when the switcher participates directly in the stock market.


                         II.D. Young Consumers Who Do Not Save15


         Young consumers are allowed to borrow to purchase risky capital but are not

allowed to borrow to finance consumption in excess of disposable income. Formally, this

borrowing constraint is

         Suppose that Tk = 0 and consider a young consumer with : < :

that the consumer does not participate in the stock market. In the absence of the

constraints that prevent their consumption from increasing in response to a change in the portfolio of the
social security system.

           Henceforth, I will assume that the level of wealth at which the borrowing

constraint just binds, :0, is less than the level of wealth at which savers are indifferent

                                          .16 Thus, :0 and :
about participating in the stock market, :                   define three regions in the

wealth distribution. Low-income consumers have : smaller than :0. These consumers

consume their disposable income wn – T when they are young and do not participate in

the stock market. Middle-income consumers have : greater than :0, so that the

                                                       , so that they do not participate in
borrowing constraint is not binding, but smaller than :

                                                             . They save some of
the stock market. High-income consumers have : greater than :

their disposable and participate in the stock market.

           The critical value that separates consumers for whom the borrowing constraint

           In this section I examine equilibrium in the markets for riskless bonds and risky

capital. Let BD(r, Tk, Tb, T, AK) be the aggregate demand for bonds, which can be written

as

The first integral on the right hand side of equation (33) is the demand for bonds by high-

income consumers, and the second integral on the right hand side is the demand for bonds

by middle-income consumers. The final term on the right hand side, TbG(n0), is the

amount of bonds held indirectly by low-income consumers, who do not directly hold any

bonds.

           Riskless bonds are issued by the government. In the context of the United States,

riskless bonds are issued by the Treasury and are held by individuals and by the Social

Security Trust Fund. Let B denote the aggregate quantity of riskless bonds issued by the

Treasury.17 In principle, private consumers, or groups of private consumers could issue

bonds, but since these privately issued bonds would be assets of some private agents and



aversion I to exceed one can reduce <(r) relative to its value in equation (25b), and thus can reduce the size
of the fixed cost F1+ F2 needed to make condition (*) hold.

demand for bonds that would arise if no consumers participated in the stock market. The aggregate demand
for bonds cannot exceed this value, and thus equilibrium requires that the supply of bonds be no larger than
this amount.


                                                                24

equal to B. Equilibrium in the bond market is represented by

       Let KD(r, Tk, Tb, T, AK) be the aggregate demand for risky capital, which can be

written as

Low-income and middle-income young consumers hold capital only indirectly, through

the social security system, and their aggregate holding of risky capital is shown by the

first term on the right hand side of equation (35). The second term on the right hand side

of this equation is the demand for risky capital by high-income consumers.

       Let K c be the aggregate amount of risky capital held at the end of the current

period. It is distinct from K, which is the aggregate amount of capital held at the

beginning of the current period (the end of the previous period) and used in production

during the current period. Equilibrium in the market for risky capital is represented by

IV. The Effect of Investing a Small Amount of Social Security in the Stock Market


       Now consider the effects of changing the portfolio of the social security system.

Specifically, assume that initially the social security system holds only riskless bonds so




                                                                25
that Tk = 0. Then suppose that in the current period, the social security system sells a

small amount of bonds per capita and uses the proceeds of this sale to purchase risky

capital. Formally, dTb = - dTk < 0 so that the total value of assets in the social security

system is unchanged. In addition, suppose that the Treasury does not change the current

amount of bonds, B, outstanding at the end of the current period. The analysis in this

paper will focus on the effects of this policy during the current period.18

         Because the change in the portfolio of the social security system leaves the value

of Tb + Tk unchanged, the value of wealth, :, is unchanged for each young consumer in

the current period. This invariance of : to the composition of the portfolio of the social

security system implies that if all consumers participate in all markets, including the stock

market, they will not change their total holdings (direct plus indirect) of either bonds or

stocks. Specifically, when the social security system sells a dollar of bonds and purchases

a dollar of risky capital on behalf of each young consumer, each young consumer would

offset this asset swap by purchasing an additional dollar of bonds and selling one dollar of

risky capital. In this case, investing social security funds in the stock market is merely a

“shell game” with no effects on the real allocation of consumption.




18
  A fully dynamic analysis that examines future periods as well as the current period would have to take
account of the Treasury’s budget constraint Bt+1 = rtBt + Gt – Tt where Bt is the aggregate value of bonds
outstanding at the beginning of period t, rt is the gross riskless interest rate on assets held from period t-1 to
period t, Gt is aggregate government purchases by the Treasury during period t, and Tt is total tax
collections during period t. None of the variables rt, Bt, Bt+1, Gt and Tt is affected by the change in policy in
period t. However, the riskless interest rate rt+1 will change as a result of this policy, which will require
future changes in government purchases, taxes, or the path of bonds outstanding. These changes do not
affect the equilibrium in the current period (period t), which is the focus of this analysis. Because Diamond
and Geanakoplos (1999) analyze future periods as well as the period in which the portfolio of the social
security system is changed, they must take a stand on how the government reacts to a change in the interest
rate on its bonds. They assume that an increase in the interest rate leads the government to increase taxes
on old consumers to maintain the level of government bonds unchanged.


                                                        26
         The shell game result depends on the assumption that all consumers participate in

the stock market and hence can offset the effects of the change in the portfolio of the

social security system. But most consumers hold no stock in their portfolios,19 and hence

the assumptions underlying the shell game result are violated. The present model takes

account of non-stockholders and the consequent departure from the shell game result. In

         The effect on the capital stock in equation (37) is the sum of two terms. The first

term represents the reduction in aggregate saving resulting from the increased

consumption of middle-income consumers, who do not participate in the stock market.

This increased consumption arises because a one-dollar shift from bonds to risky capital

increases expected second-period income by the equity premium E{R} - r, and the present

value of this increase is [E{R} - r]/r. The marginal propensity to consume when young is

1/(1+E), so the increase in the present value of expected income increases the

consumption of each middle-income consumer by 'cM { [1/(1+E)] [E{R} - r]/r.20 The

aggregate effect, represented by the first of the two terms in equation (37), is obtained by

multiplying 'cM by the measure of middle-income consumers, G n  G n0 .         bg b g

  Low-income consumers also enjoy an increase in expected second-period income but are prevented from
increasing their current consumption by a binding borrowing constraint.

         The second term on the right hand side of equation (37) is the increase in

aggregate saving that arises as switchers endogenously change their status from group H,

which holds risky capital, to group M, which does not participate in the stock market.

                               V. Ignoring the Effects of Switchers


         For the remainder of this paper, I will ignore the behavior of switchers. One

rationale for ignoring switchers is that I am analyzing a change in the portfolio of the

social security system after the current generation of workers has decided whether to

participate in the stock market for risky capital, but before they make a final choice about

how much to consume when young. In this scenario, consumers are allowed to react to

the change in the portfolio of the social security system. Consumers who had been

indifferent about participating in the stock market, but who had nonetheless chosen to

participate, have already incurred the fixed cost of participation. Since this cost is already

sunk, these consumers will not switch to non-stockholder status. Simply put, consumers

with n     n will not switch away from participating in the stock market.21

         A second rationale for ignoring switchers is that the direction in which their

saving responds to the change in the portfolio of the social security system is not robust to

the specification of fixed costs. With the formulation of fixed costs in this paper,

21
  The direction of the switch is important for the sunk cost argument here. In this case, the change in the
                                                                                                 In addition,
portfolio of the social security system increases the riskless interest rate r, which increases :.




                                                      28
switchers who choose not to hold stocks have higher saving than switchers who choose to

hold stocks, but this result could be reversed by a different formulation of fixed costs.22


                   V.A. The Effect on Portfolios of Individual Consumers


         Ignoring the behavior of switchers, the effect on the aggregate capital stock of the

change in the portfolio of the social security system is given by the first of the two terms

in equation (37). Table 1 illustrates this result by focusing on the portfolios of individual

consumers. First examine the row for low-income consumers. Young low-income

consumers do not hold any assets directly. All of their assets are held indirectly through

the social security system, so the change in the portfolio of the social security system

increases capital by one dollar and reduces bonds by one dollar for each young low-

income consumer. Now examine the row for middle-income consumers. As discussed

below equation (20), a one-dollar increase in Tk accompanied by a one-dollar decrease in

Tb causes middle-income consumers to increase their consumption by 'cM {

[1/(1+E ][E{R}-r]/r dollars, and therefore to reduce their total assets by 'cM dollars.

Because each middle-income consumer increases the holding of risky capital by one

dollar while reducing total assets by 'cM dollars, each middle-income consumer’s holding



                               Since :
the increase in Tk increases :.          increases, potential switchers would switch from participating to
not participating in the stock market, but they would not avoid the fixed cost already incurred.
22
   Suppose that in addition to the fixed costs F1 and F2, participation in the stock market involves a utility
                                                             b       g     mb         gr
cost when old. For example, if the utility function is U ln c  GF2  EE ln x  GF3 , then, as shown in
                        E

                            :  F1  F2  F3 / Er . Recall from equation (19) that a middle-income

consumer’s total assets equal E : . If F1 + F2 – F3/(Er) > 0, as in the model in the text, the total assets of
                              1 E
a switcher who participates in the stock market will be less than those of a switcher who does not participate
in the stock market. However, if F1 + F2 – F3/(Er) < 0, the total assets of a switcher who participates in the
stock market will be greater than those of a switcher who does not participate in the stock market.

            Since the aggregate supply of bonds is held fixed, equilibrium in the bond market

requires that high-income consumers increase their holdings of bonds by the amount

shown in the final column of Table 1, so that the change in the aggregate holding of

bonds, shown in the lower right corner of Table 1, is zero. High-income consumers are

induced to increase their holdings of bonds by an increase in the riskless interest rate r,

which causes them to shift some of their assets from risky capital to riskless bonds.23

Since the total value of assets held by each high-income consumer is unchanged, the

increase in bond holdings in the final column is offset by an equal decrease in the holding

of risky capital, as shown in Table 1.

        The effect on the aggregate holding of risky capital is obtained by weighting the

effects on low-income, middle-income, and high-income consumers by their respective

measures. As shown in the final row of Table 1, the aggregate effect on the amount of

        The replacement of a small amount of bonds by an equal value of risky capital in

the portfolio of the social security system changes the utility of middle-income consumers

by dVM, where

and the sign is obtained using equations (23) and (22b) along with dTk > 0 and dr > 0.

Middle-income consumers benefit in two ways from the change in the portfolio of the

social security system. First, they benefit from holding risky capital, which has a higher

expected rate of return than bonds. In addition, because they are recipients of interest

income, they benefit from the increase in the riskless interest rate. Similarly, low-income

consumers benefit from holding risky capital, and because they are recipients of interest

on their indirect holdings of bonds in the social security system, they benefit from the

increase in the riskless interest rate.

where the second equality uses equation (17b). High-income consumers, who hold

capital directly, are not directly affected by the change in Tk because they can offset this

change in the social security system’s portfolio by changing their own directly-held

portfolios. However, the change in the riskless interest rate affects the maximized utility

of high-income consumers. Since dr > 0, the sign of the effect in equation (39) is the

same as the sign of 1 – J, which is the share of bonds in the portfolios of high-income

consumers. In principle, if the aggregate supply of bonds, B, is sufficiently small, the

value of 1 – J could be negative, but the empirically relevant case is one in which high-

income consumers have positive holdings of bonds so that 1 – J is positive. In this case,

high-income consumers benefit from the increase in the riskless interest rate.

       I have shown that if high-income consumers have long positions in bonds, the

change in the portfolio of the social security system increases the utility of young

consumers in all three income classes. Old consumers are unaffected by this change. So

does the change in the portfolio of the social security system represent a free lunch,

making some consumers better off without harming others? The answer is no. The next

generation will work with a smaller capital stock and thus will have smaller wage income

than it would have had otherwise. In addition, the increase in the riskless interest rate is

costly to the issuer of bonds. Since the government is the issuer of bonds, the increase in




                                              32
the riskless interest rate is costly to the government, which means that it is costly to future

taxpayers.24


               VI. An Estimate of the Effect on the Aggregate Capital Stock




           The effect of a change in the portfolio of the social security system on the

aggregate capital stock, ignoring switchers, is given by the first of the two terms on the

right hand side of equation (37)

This effect is the product of three term terms. The first term, 1/(1+E), is the marginal

propensity to consume when young. I will assume that one period in the model

corresponds to 25 years and that the annual rate of time preference is 1%. Under these

assumptions, E = (1.01)-25 = 0.7798, and the marginal propensity to consume is 1/(1+E) =

0.5619.

           The second term is the present value of the equity premium, [E{R}-r]/r.

Cecchetti, Lam, and Mark (1993, Table 2, p. 35) report that over the period 1892-1987,

the average value of the equity premium, E{R} – r, is 0.0663 and the average (gross)

riskless rate is r = 1.0119, so the average rate of return on equity, E{R}, is 1.0782. These



24
  There is an element of a free lunch here because the social security system can purchase risky capital on
behalf of consumers without incurring the costs F1 or F2. However, it remains true that future generations
of workers and taxpayers are harmed by the reduction in their wages and by the consequences of the
increased cost of debt service.


                                                           33
average rates of return are expressed on an annual basis. Treating a period in the model

as 25 years implies [E{R}-r]/r = [1.078225 - 1.011925]/1.011925 = 3.8870.

               The third term is the fraction of consumers who save some of their disposable

income but do not participate in the stock market, i.e., the fraction of consumers that are

middle-income consumers. Ameriks and Zeldes (2000, Exhibit 9B) report that 36.8% of

households held less than $5000 of financial wealth and less than $1000 of stock in any

form in 1995. I will treat these households as low-income households and thus set G(n0)

= 0.368. They also report that 36.7% of households owned more than $1000 of stock in

1995. I will treat these households as high-income households in the model, and thus set

      bg
G n = 0.633.25 Therefore, the fraction of middle-income consumers, G n  G n0 , is                        bg b g
0.265.26



25
  Mankiw and Zeldes (1991, Table 1) report that in 1984, 72.4% of households did not own any stock and
4.5% of households held some stock but less than $1000 of stock, so the comparable value of G n in 1984           bg
                                   bg
was 0.769. The decline in G n from 1984 to 1995 reflects the increasing extent of stock ownership in the
U.S. economy over that time.
26
   I have assumed that all young consumers have equal claims on future social security benefits, despite the
fact that they have different pre-tax income, wn. An alternative specification is that a consumer with
effective labor endowment n has a claim on future social security benefits with a present value of O(n)T,

However, in the case with O(n) increasing in n,

         If the social security system increases its holding of risky capital by one dollar per

capita and reduces its holding of riskless bonds by one dollar per capita, the aggregate

holding of risky capital will fall by more than 57 cents per capita. Because the magnitude

of this effect is surprisingly large, I explore the sensitivity of this calculation to various

factors. Table 2 reports the quantitative effects of various changes that are designed to

reduce the magnitude of this effect. Column (1) contains the baseline calculation

presented in equation (41). The effect on capital stock is reported in the final row.

Reducing the rate of time preference to zero reduces the marginal propensity to consume,

1/(1+E), to 0.5 and reduces the magnitude of the effect on the capital stock to 0.52

(column (2)). Reducing the assumed number of years per period to 20 reduces both the

marginal propensity to consume and the average equity premium per period, and thus

reduces the magnitude of the effect on the capital stock to 0.37 (column (3)). Reducing

the expected rate of return on risky capital, E{R}, by 1 percentage point per year reduces

the magnitude of the effect on the capital stock to 0.43 (column (4)). Increasing the

riskless interest rate by one percentage point per year reduces the magnitude of the effect

to 0.42 (column (5)). Although each of the changes explored in columns (2) – (5) reduces

the magnitude of the effect, in all cases the magnitude of the effect remains greater than


to the cap) than if they are independent of wn. Of course, the results of this example could be reversed for a

0.35. Putting together all of these changes reduces the magnitude of the effect to 0.19 as

shown in column (6). Thus, even allowing for the possibility that the baseline calculation

overstates the magnitude of the effect, the effect appears to be quite substantial.

                                       VII. Concluding Remarks


         The general equilibrium model developed in this paper shows that if the social

security system sells some bonds and purchases an equal amount of equity, the effect on

the aggregate capital stock is the sum of two terms. The first term reflects the income

effect of middle-income consumers who benefit from the increased rate of return on

assets held in the portfolio of the social security system and have the resources to increase

their consumption when they are young. In response to this increase in their effective

wealth, middle-income consumers increase their consumption, which reduces national

saving and capital accumulation. The second term reflects the behavior of switchers who


different distribution of n and different values of n0 and n .


                                                        36
would have been indifferent about participating directly in the stock market before the

change in the social security system’s portfolio. As a result of the social security system’s

holding of equity, these switchers would choose not to participate directly in the stock

market and thus would avoid paying the fixed cost of participating in that market. With

the formulation of fixed costs in this model, avoiding the fixed costs induces switchers to

increase their saving, but this effect is not particularly robust. To the extent that switchers

increase their saving, their response to the change in the social security system’s portfolio

works in the opposite direction of the response of middle-income consumers.

       To study the quantitative impact on the aggregate capital stock of the change in

the social security system’s portfolio, I have chosen to ignore the behavior of switchers

for two reasons: (1) if I consider a change in the social security system after the current

generation of workers has already incurred the fixed cost of participating in the stock

market, they will not switch; and (2) under a reasonable alternative formulation, switchers

might reduce rather than increase their saving. Ignoring switchers, I have shown that if

the social security system sells one dollar of bonds and buys one dollar of equity, the

aggregate capital stock would fall by a little more than a half dollar. Of course, the

estimated effect on the aggregate capital stock would be reduced by taking account of

switchers, if they have not already incurred the fixed cost of stock market participation,

and if fixed costs are as modeled in this paper. Future research is needed to explore the

potential quantitative importance of switchers.

       Though the income effect on middle-income consumers, which is the driving

force behind the reduction in the aggregate capital stock, is very straightforward in this

model, it is important to consider factors that mitigate, or even reverse, this effect. These


                                              37
factors could be usefully addressed in future research. In the current model, middle-

income consumers would choose to hold a positive amount of risky capital if there were

no fixed costs. Thus, when the trust fund of the social security system sells some bonds

in exchange for risky capital, these middle-income consumers regard themselves as better

off and increase their consumption when young. However, if middle-income consumers

would choose to hold a negative amount of risky capital in the absence of fixed costs,

then they would reduce their consumption and increase their saving when the social

security trust fund sell bonds in exchange for risky capital. High risk aversion alone

would not lead consumers to choose a negative amount of risky capital in this model,

because the equity premium on risky capital is positive, and there are no other risks in the

model. But if consumers face other risks, such as homeownership or ownership interests

in small businesses, that are positively correlated with the return on risky capital, then

high risk aversion may lead consumers to choose a negative amount of risky capital in

their portfolios.27

         The logarithmic utility function in equation (10) has both an intertemporal

elasticity of substitution equal to one and a coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to

one. The unitary intertemporal elasticity of substitution, together with the assumption

that consumers do not work when old, implies that saving does not depend on the interest

rate. However, to the extent that an increase in the interest rate leads to an increase in

saving by consumers, the quantitative results in this paper will be mitigated or possibly

even reversed. As discussed in the introduction, Diamond and Geanakoplos (1999) have

27
  A more general point is that the model does not contain a good reason for the institution of social
security. Perhaps the inclusion of such a reason might alter the conclusions in this paper. However, the




                                                     38
analyzed a model that emphasizes the interest rate effect on saving, but their model has

no middle-income consumers and thus ignores the income effect emphasized in this

paper.

         In this paper, I focused on the effect on aggregate capital accumulation, and for

the purpose of calibration, I matched the equity premium in the model with the empirical

average equity premium. I did not attempt to explain the equity premium in terms of

fundamental preferences and technologies. As is well known from the literature on the

equity premium puzzle, the unitary coefficient of relative risk aversion associated with

the logarithmic preferences in this paper is too low to account for the observed equity

premium. I have presented, in footnote 5, a utility function that retains the unitary

intertemporal elasticity of substitution but has an arbitrary coefficient of relative risk

aversion. The quantitative results presented in Table 2 continue to hold under this more

general utility function. However, a higher coefficient of relative risk aversion will

increase the equilibrium equity premium and can help reduce the size of the fixed cost

necessary to prevent stock market participation by middle-income consumers.

         There are various proposals to reform social security, and, no doubt, several new

proposals will appear. I have chosen to focus not on a particular reform proposal, but

instead to focus on a particular feature—investing part of the trust fund in risky capital—

that is found in some proposals. Proposals that include risky investment by the trust fund

include other aspects, such as guaranteed minimum benefits to retirees, that require

further study. Nor have I addressed any corporate governance issues that might arise if

the social security system owned stock in private enterprises. With these same caveats,


goal of this paper is simply to take the existence of social security as given and to analyze a specific change


                                                      39
the analysis of this paper can also be applied to proposals that include individual accounts

without investment options for individuals.

         To sharpen the analysis of the social security system’s portfolio, I have confined

attention to fully-funded, defined-contribution social security systems in which the shell

game argument is transparent. However, the current social security system in the United

States is closer to a pay-as-you-go, defined-benefit plan. In the fully-funded, defined-

contribution system analyzed in this paper, the current workers bear the risk associated

with next period’s risky return to equity held by the social security system.28 However, in

a pay-as-you-go, defined-benefit system there is more scope for intergenerationally

sharing the risk associated with the return to capital held by the social security system.




in the way the trust fund is invested.
28
   In a defined-benefit system, the additional investment income obtained by investing some of the trust
fund in higher-yielding risky capital rather than bonds accrues to young consumers in the form of lower
payroll taxes and hence higher disposable income. Middle-income and high-income young consumers
would save part of the additional disposable income and consume part of it, and low-income consumers
would consume all of it. Of course, in the period in which the social security system begins to invest in
risky capital, which is the focus of this paper, the effects would not yet be operative. For an analysis of
risky trust fund investment in a defined-benefit system along a growth path in an overlapping generations
model with a representative agent in each generation, see Abel (1999).
