                 Time Series Evidence of the Effect of the Minimum Wage
                          on Youth Employment and Unemployment

      While previous time series studies have quite consistently found that

 the minimum wage reduces teenage employment, the extent of this reduction

 is much less certain. Moreover, because few previous studies report results

of more than one specification, the causes of differences in estimated

 impacts are not well understood. Less consensus is evident on the effect

of the minimum wage on teenage unemployment, or its relative impact on

black and white teenagers.

     The purpose of this paper is both to update earlier work and to analyze

the sensitivity of estimated minimum wage effects to alternative specifi-

cation choices. In addition to providing estimates of the effect of minimum

wage increases on aggregate employment and unemployment rates of teenagers,

we explore several related issues: the relative importance of changing

the level and coverage of the minimum wage; the timing of responses to a

change in the minimum; effects on part—time and full—time work; effects

on young adults (age 20—24).

     In the last ten years, roughly twenty time-series studies of the effects of

minimum wages on the employment and unemployment of teenagers (16- to 19-year-

olds) have appeared. For teenagers as a group, most studies found that a 10 per-

cent increase in the minimum wage would reduce teenage employment by one to

three percent. The range of estimates of the effect of such an increase on the

unemployment rate was considerably wider -- from essentially zero to over three

percent (Brown, Gilroy and Kohen, 1981). Our survey revealed no support for the

popular view that black teenagers suffer larger employment losses than their

white counterparts, although there is some evidence that unemployment effects

of the minimum wage are larger for blacks than for whites. The few studies which

focused on 20-24 year olds found that the minimum wage reduced employment and

increased unemployment for this group, but by lesser amounts than for teenagers.

     In most of the research, the period studied ended in the late 1960s or

early 1970s, so that the more recent experience (the 1974 and 1977 Amendments to

the Fair Labor Standards Act) was not included. As one might expect, the studies

differ in their choice of functional forms, lag structures, and independent

variables. Surprisingly, however, there is very little discussion of how these

differences affect the estimated minimum wage effects.

     The purpose of this paper is to update existing estimates of the effects of

minimum wages on employment and unemployment rates of youth, and to compare the

results of different specifications. Section I briefly describes the theoretical

framework in which the minimum wage has been analyzed. Section II discusses an

operational model for the estimation of employment and unemployment effects of

changes in the minimum wage and presents a summary of estimates of the major

studies, while Section III describes the data sources and estimation procedures

together with the results of our empirical analysis. Section IV provides some

empirical extensions to the basic analysis. Section V summarizes the major find-

ings and provides concluding remarks.



I.   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

     The conventional neoclassical theory posits a decline in the level of em-

ployment in response to an increase in (or introduction of) a statutory minimum

wage. At the above-equilibrium wage, employers respond to the higher cost of

labor by using less of it, and an excess supply of labor forms as fewer jos are

rationed among more workers. Of course, the basis of comparison is what would

otherwise have occurred; in a situation where employment was expanding, the

minimum wage would simply limit the increase in employment.

     Two alternatives to this conventional competitive model are possible: the

familiar textbook example of a monopsonist who may actually hire more labor in

response to a skillfully set minimum (Stigler, 1946), and the case of an em-

ployer who is "shocked" into increasing productivity when faced with a higher

wage bill as a result of the minimum wage.' The validity of these models is dif-

ficult to assess directly however. To the extent that their predictions of the

employment effect differ from that of the standard model, they can be tested

with the same estimating equations. That is, only the researcher's prior expec-

tation about the direction of the employment effect would differ.2

     Recent theoretical work on the employment effects associated with the

minimum wage has centered on two basic extensions of the standard competitive

 model: (1) the explicit inclusion of both the covered and uncovered sectors,

 and (2) a more careful treatment of the effects of the minimum wage on measured

 unemployment.
                                                       --   those which are covered
      Recognizing the existence of two types of jobs

 by the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and those which are

  not -- a
           mandated minimum wage increase would be expected to reduce employment in

  the covered sector. Workers who are unable to find jobs in this sector
                                                                         are faced
 with several alternatives: (1) accept employment in the uncovered sector,
                                                                           perhaps
 while searching for covered
                             employment; (2) remain unemployed with the hope of
 obtaining a job in the covered sector; or (3) withdraw from the labor force. To

 the extent that the first alternative is
                                               chosen, the wage in the uncovered sector
 would fall, and the resultant employment increase
                                                       would help mitigate the employ-
 ment loss in the covered sector. There is
                                               a possibility, too, that wages in the

 uncovered sector may actually rise, if workers in the uncovered sector choose to

 search for jobs in the covered sector at the higher FLSA-determined wage.

      The net result depends
                                upon the elasticities of demand for labor in the

 covered and uncovered sectors, the rate of withdrawal from the labor force, and

 the extent to which displaced workers in the covered sector remain unemployed

 in hopes of finding work there. The relative magnitudes of these several factors

clearly is an empirical matter, and the net outcome of their interaction cannot

be predicted by theory alone.

      The second refinement of the basic model is a movement away from the view

that workers displaced by the imposition of a (higher) minimum wage, together

with those who may be attracted to the labor market to search for work at the

higher wage, comprise the pool of unemployed. Because some of these persons be-

come discouraged with job prospects and leave the labor force, they are excluded

from the official unemployment count. Mincer
                                                 (1976) has formally modelled this
latter choice, assuming that those who are officially unemployed regard the

ability of finding a covered job as more attractive than either uncovered sector

employment or nonmarket alternatives. In this model, the
                                                             possibility of searching
for covered-sector work while
                                remaining employed in an uncovered job is not con-
sidered.

II. PREVIOUS RESEARCH

    Time-series studies which attempt to estimate the effect of minimum wages

on the labor force status of youth have relied upon single equation models of

the type


           Y   f (MW, D, X1. .   •Xn)

where the dependent variable Y is a measure of labor force status. Independent

variables include MW as a measure of the minimum wage, D as a business cycle

variable, and X1... X, which represent a host of other presumably exogenous ex-

planatory factors.

     To measure the "employment effect" of the minimum wage, the ratio of em-

ployment to population is used most often as the dependent variable. "Unemploy-

ment effects" are usually measured as the effect of the minimum wage on the

proportion of the labor force (or of the population) unemployed. Unemployment

equations were characteristic of the earlier studies; the more recent research

has estimated the effects of the minimum wage on the employment-population and

labor force-population ratios, and has derived the unemployment effects from

these.
                                                          measured by the ratio of
     The key variable, minimum wage, has generally been

the nominal legal minimum wage to average hourly earnings weighted by coverage,

as devised by Kaitz (1970). Ratios of minimum wage rates to average hourly earn-

 ings were calculated for each industry, weighted by the proportion of workers

 covered. These were combined into an index in which the weight for each industry
                                                                proportion of total
 ratio is the number of persons employed in the industry as a

 employment (Gavett, 1970). Specifically, the index takes the form


                 E.                             .

                                         -5-.




      where

              E   =   nonagricultural   employment
           MW =       basic   minimum wage rate

           AHE =      average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers
           C      =   proportion of nonsupervisory workers covered by the basic
                      minimum wage rate

          MW* =       minimum wage rate for newly covered workers

          C =         proportion of nonsupervisory employees covered by the mini-
                      mum wage applicable to newly covered workers

          i       =   major industry division
          t       =   total   private nonagricultural economy



Most studies which use this index use teenage employment ratios as weights.

     This formulation allows the index to reflect changes in coverage as well as

in the level of the minimum wage, and further, embodies the idea that the impact

of a given minimum would be greater the higher is that minimum relative to

market-determined wages. Most studies have incorporated Kaitz's measure or some

variant of it in their regression equations, combining the coverage and level

of the minimum in a single variable.

     All studies incorporate a business cycle variable as a measure of the over-

all demand for labor, for which many proxies have been used. Additional vari-

ables often included are those to control for youth's participation in the armed

forces and in employment and training programs, school enrollment, and potential

labor supply. Most studies have included a time trend variable as well.

     The findings of those studies which attempt to measure the employment/un-

employment effects of a minimum wage on    teenagers (16-19 years) are reported
in Table 1. In order to enhance the comparability of these studies, their re—

suits are displayed in terms of elasticities for employment and percentage point
                                     -6-




increases for the unemployment rate.3

    To further enhance comparability of results, several types of aggregation4

were necessary: (1) combining separate estimates for 16-17 and 18-19 year olds

when estimates for the 16-19 group were not presented; (2) for different race-

sex groups when results for teenagers as a whole were not reported; and (3) sep-

arate estimates for enrolled and non-enrolled individuals.5

     The unemployment effects in Table 1 represent the change in the unemploy-

ment rate due to a 10 percent change in the minimum wage. For example, an entry

of 0.50 would indicate that a minimum wage increase of 10 percent is estimated

to raise the unemployment rate from, say, 6.0 to 6.5 percent. Just as the em-

ployment elasticities were aggregated as described above, so the labor force

elasticities were similarly weighted using labor force shares.

     On balance, the effects of a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage are

estimated to result in about a 1-3 percent reduction in total teenage employ-

ment (Table 1). All studies find a negative employment effect for all teenagers

together. Since it was necessary to compute many of the overall effects" from

the disaggregated age-sex-race equations, it is not possible to conduct tests

to determine whether they are statistically significant. The coefficients from

these disaggregated equations were mostly negative, with about half being sta-

tistically significant.

     Although the research is consistent in finding some employment reduction

associated with minimum wage increases, the estimated effects on unemployment

appear to be considerably more varied. Of particular note are the diverse un-

employment effects estimated by Adie (1971) and Moore (1971) on the one hand,

and Lovell (1973) on the other in response to a 10 percent increase in the mini-

mum wage.

     Table 1 does demonstrate that there are many different specifications re—

 presented in these studies. Indeed, the only generalization one can make about

 all the studies is that each includes some measure of changing economic condi-

tions as a control variable. It is difficult to assess how the differences in

model specifications affect the results since most authors do not report how

their findings changed as a result of changes in variables, functional form,

etc. Lovell (1973) is an exception to this and he found that inclusion of one

variable (youth's share of population) had important consequences for the esti-

mated unemployment effects. Table 1 bears this out. Two of the four largest

estimates appear in studies which exclude the population share variable (Adie,

1971 and 1973) while the four smaller estimates are found in studies which in-

clude it (Kaitz, 1970; Lovell, 1972 and 1973; Freeman, 1979).6

     The issue of which "control" variables ought to be included in the esti-

mating equations has not been fully resolved. There is general agreement that

other determinants of demand for teenagers should be held constant in estimating

the effect of the minimum wage on employment, labor force participation, and

unemployment. There is less agreement not only on the appropriateness of in-

cluding supply side variables (Adie-Gallaway, 1973; Fisher, 1973; Lovell, 1973;

Goldfarb, 1974), but on precisely which ones and the form they should take if

included (Wachter-Kim, 1979).

     The simple supply-demand model described above is sometimes used to argue

for the exclusion of supply-determining variables from both employment and unem-

ployment equations. The model suggests that employment is demand-determined in

the presence of a minimum wage (i.e., how much excess supply is present has no

effect on employment), so that supply-side variables do not belong in the esti-

mating equation. Moreover, because supply would equal demand in the absence of

the minimum wage, increases in the supply of teenagers which increase teenage

unemployment are really "minimum wage" effects as well, and hence are mistakenly
                                      -8-




attributed to the supply-side variables if they are included in the estimation.

     In our view, this position loses much of its persuasiveness once the overly

restrictive assumptions of the simplest supply-demand model are relaxed. For
                                                                          be cor-
example, the view that employment of teenagers is demand-determined

rect for the half of teenagers who earn the minimum wage, but is hard to accept

for the remaining half who earn more than the minimum. Their employment (and

hence the employment of teenagers as a group) must depend on the relative sup-

ply as well as the demand for teenage labor. (Even if the demand-determination
                                                   supply-side variables would
argument were correct, including truly exogenous

not bias the minimum wage coefficient in the employment equation, though they

might somewhat reduce the precision with which it can be estimated. )1

     Including supply-determining variables in equations explaining teenage un-

employment also seems warranted. Contrary to the apparent message of the sim-
                                            would be unemployed in the absence of
plest supply-demand model, some teenagers
                                                       unemployment rate of teen-
the minimum wage, as is demonstrated by the non-zero

agers who ordinarily earn more than the minimum. Hence, the extent of unemploy-

ment not caused by the minimum wage must be held constant, and including vari-

 ables which reflect relative supplies is necessary. This does, perhaps, intro-

 duce some ambiguity into estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on teenage
                                                                if the minimum
 unemployment -- how much teenage unemployment would be reduced

                                the relevant policy issue is the effect of marginal
 wage were repealed. However,

 changes in the minimum wage, and holding the relative supply of teenagers con-

 stant is certainly necessary to make that evaluation.8



 III. RESULTS

      Like the studies listed in Table 1, our basic sources of data were the pub-

 lished and unpublished monthly series from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

Effects on Teenage Employment
     Table 2 presents our estimates of the effects of minimum wages on teenage

employment, using various specifications of the estimating equation. The four

columns reflect differences in the functional form of the equation --         linear   or

double-log -- and the estimation procedure -- GLS (which takes into account ser-

ial correlation in the disturbance terms) or OLS. Because the OLS Durbin—Watson

(DW) statistics consistently showed appreciable serial correlation (a typical DW

statistic being 1.0 or less), the GLS equations should be given greater weight;

the OLS equations are included in part because correction for serial correla-

tion in the literature is rare.1' The rows of Table 2 differ in the control

variables included in addition to the minimum wage index in explaining the em-

ployment/population ratio.

     Line 1 of Table 2 reports estimates from our "basic" equation --

controls for season of the year, trend (as well as a quadratic time trend),

cyclical factors (measured by the prime-age adult unemployment rate), and four

supply-side variables (SY, AF/P, TRIP, and POP), in addition to the minimum

wage index YK. The coefficients from these regressions have been converted to

the same measure used in Table 1: the percent change in employment resulting

from a 10 percent change in the minimum wage.

      Apart from the "GLS linear" estimates, the versions of the "basic" equation

 imply a one percent reduction in teenage employment as a result of a 10 percent

 increase in the minimum wage index. The GLS linear
                                                          estimate --   which uses the

 linear specification often found in the literature but which corrects for first-

 order serial correlation --    is   only about one half as large.

      Lines 2-6 report results of individually deleting five variables which are

 often omitted from the studies in Table 1 --      the   quadratic time-trend term, and

 the four supply-side variables. These alterations have relatively little effect

  on the estimates --
                        implying   roughly one percent employment reductions in re-
  sponse to a 10 percent increase in the minimum
                                                    wage index. Once again the GLS
  linear procedure produces
                            consistently smaller estimates, but these estimates,
  too, are rather insensitive to the
                                     inclusion or exclusion of these "marginal"
  variables.

       Lines 7-9 report the results of
                                          individually adding variables to the esti-
 mating equation. In line 7, POPA, the
                                           population share of young adults aged
 20-24 is added. One would
                              expect that young adults are relatively substitut-
 able for teenagers, so that an increased availability of
                                                          young adults would
 tend to reduce teenage employment.
                                    However, the estimated coefficient of POPA
 (not shown in Table 2) was
                             Consistently and significantly positive. In any case,
 its inclusion raises the estimated
                                     impact of the minimum wage by three to six
 tenths of a percentage point.

      We also considered the
                               Possibility that expansions in welfare programs were
 an important determinant of
                               teenage employment. Presumably, availability of wel-
 fare benefits would act as a deterrent to employment by
                                                            welfare-eligible teen-
agers. We measured the impact of welfare
                                             programs (PCWEL) by the price-deflated
value of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent
                                                           Children, Food Stamp,
and Commodity Distribution programs, per woman in the child-bearing
                                                                    years. An
important methodological issue is whether to use a benefits per case (or
                                                                         per
recipient) or a benefits per capita
                                    measure. We opted for the latter, on the
grounds that much of the "welfare
                                     explosion" of the 1960s took the form of a
greater fraction of eligible families
                                         receiving benefits -- a phenomenon which
the benefits per capita measure captures, and the benefits
                                                           per case (or per re-
cipient) does not. Indeed, from
                                   1967-73, the price—deflated value of AFDC bene-
fits per case declined. In any event, increased real welfare benefits were
                                                                           as-
sociated with eater teenage employment, a result for which we have no
                                                                      ready

explanation. Including the welfare variable raises the estimated effect of the
                                                                  but has almost
minimum wage index by 0.6 point in the logarithmic equations,

no effect in the linear versions.12

     Finally, the enrollment/population ratio is added as a control variable

(line 9). It was not included in the ubasicti equation because of some misgivings

about the possibility that it is determined by the minimum wage and/or the teen-

age employment or unemployment rates, and hence is not a pure "exogenous" vari-

able. Its inclusion reduces the estimated minimum wage impact in the OLS equa-

tions, but has little effect in the GLS equations.

     The minimum wage index YK used in lines 1-9 can be thought of as the prod-

uct of the relative level of the minimum wage (compared with average hourly

earnings) times the fraction of teenagers who are subject to minimum wage pro-
                                                                  nature of the
visions. (This interpretation neglects the "weighted-average"
                                                             relative level and
variable.) While this seems a plausible way of combining

coverage into a single index, it does not permit the estimation of the relative

 importance of changes in level and coverage alone, and may combine them incor-

 ectly (Fisher, 1973, p. 516; Gramlich, 1976, p. 434).

      The logarithmic form of the equation is particularly convenient for relax-

                                             constrained relationship between level
 ing the assumed strictly multiplicative

 and coverage. The logarithm of YK can be decomposed into the sum of the logar-

 ithms of relative level and coverage:


      ln(YK) = ln(minimum wage/average hourly earnings) +     ln(coverage   ratio)



 Our coverage variable is


                             +
           YC =
                  (E1/E)(C       C)
                                          -13-



      The result of entering ln(YC) in addition to ln(YK) is shown in lines 10

 and 11. The effect of the relative minimum wage is then the coefficient of

 ln(YK), while the effect of coverage is the coefficient of ln(YK) p]us the co-

 efficient of ln(YC). The t-statistic of ln(YC) tests the hypothesis that the

 effects of ln(YK) and ln(YC) are equal --       i.e.,   that the restriction in the

 Kaitz index is correct. It can be seen that the estimated effect of the rela-

tive level of the minimum wage is about twice as large as in the constrained

version (compare line 10 with line 1, and line 11 with line 9). But the effect

of a 10 percent change in coverage is much smaller than in the constrained ver-

sion (e.g. ,   in   the GLS version of line 10, coverage effect =    -1.76   +   1.41 = -0.35
compared with the constrained estimate [from line 1] of -0.89).

     With the separate coverage variable included there are two hypotheses which

can be tested: that coverage and level effects are equal, and that coverage ef-

fects are zero. Using the t-statistic for ln(YC) to test the first hypothesis

leads to its rejection (at the .01 level) only for the OLS equation in line 10.

The t-statistic for the hypothesis that coverage does not matter (i.e. ,           that
the sum of the coeffcients of ln(YK) and ln(YC) are zero) can be calculated

from the variance-covarjance matrix of the estimated coefficients. Even the

largest of the calculated t-statistics (1.41, for the OLS equation in line 10)

is to small to reject the "no effect" hypothesis at conventional levels.

     These results suggest a disturbing ambiguity in our conclusions regarding

coverage and relative level effects. Like most other researchers (Moore, 1971;

Lovell, 1973; Gramlich, 1976; Wachter-Kim, 1979; for contrary results, see

Al-Salam, Quester and Welch, 1979), we find relatively weak coverage effects.

This suggests that the relative level of the minimum wage is more important,

and coverage less important, than intimated by the constrained equations which

are typically estimated. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that this
                                    -14-




result is due to chance alone; indeed we cannot estimate the importance of

                           13
coverage with precision.

     The equations in Table 2 relate teenage employment to the current value of

the minimum wage index, thus ignoring questions of the timing of responses to

minimum wage increases. Several of the previous studies adopted distributed lag

specifications for the minimum wage variable, thus assuming that the effects

of a minimum wage increase occur gradually over time. As Welch'4 has observed,

however, the a priori case for a lagged response is debatable High "normal"

turnover rates among teenagers allow employers to achieve desired reductions

in employment by refrainin9 from hiring new people for a short period of time.

Moreover, minimum wage increases are ordinarily announced in advance, so that

responses could as easily precede as follow a new minimum.

     Unlike earlier studies, which replaced YK with a distributed lag on YK, we

included a (quadratic, unconstrained) distributed lag in addition to the cur-

rent-quarter value, using the "basic" specification. With a 4-quarter lag, the

sum of current and lagged effects were similar to the current-quarter estimates

in Table 2, while an 8-quarter lag reduced this sum to essentially zero. Neither

4- or 8-quarter lags were statistically significant.

     We also considered the pre-announcement issue by adding a dummy variable

for periods when an increase in the minimum wage had been enacted but had not

yet gone into effect. The YK coefficients were almost unaffected; the dummy

variable reduced employment by 1 (GLS) to 2 (OLS) percent but was not signifi-

cant in the GLS specifications.'8 Adding lagged values of both YK and the dummy

did not clarify matters: the results for YK were similar to those in the pre-

 vious paragraph, while the current and lagged effects of the pre-announcement

 dummy were larger than in the current-quarter specification. Overall, we regard

 the pre-announcement effects as only suggestive; a theory of how firms should
                                       -15-



  react to such announcements, and a "variable" which reflects that theory more

  carefully than our dummy variable, are clearly needed.

       One experiment was conducted which did lead to unambiguous results. As was

 true of all studies in Table 1, we neglected the impact of the student certi-

 fication program in constructing our Kaitz index. To test the importance of

 this omission, we recomputed the Kaitz index by treating certified student

 employment as subject to a minimum wage of 85 percent of the basic minimum.

 The recomputed version of YK differed from the original version negligibly,

 and produced results almost identical (for the "basic" specification) to those

 in Table 2.



 Labor Force and Unemployment Rate Effects

      Estimates of the effect of a 10 percent increase on the teenage labor force

 (those employed or looking for work) are presented in Table 3. These are based

 on equations identical to those in Table 2, except that the labor force parti-

cipation rate (LF/P) replaces the employment/population ratio (EM/P) as the

dependent variable.

     The results of the various specifications can be summarized quite suc-

cintly. In lines 1-9, where coverage and the level of the minimum are con-

strained to have similar effects, a 10 percent increase in the minimum leads

to roughly a one percent reduction in the teenage labor force. In lines 10 and

11, the effects of a 10 percent increase in the level of the minimum are some-

what larger (1.5 to 2 percent reduction), while coverage has a smaller effect

(0.4 to 0.9 percent decrease). (Recall that, in lines 10 and II, the "coverage"

effect is the sum of the YK and YC effects.) We found to our surprise, that this

withdrawal did not take the form of similar increases in the official "discour-

aged-worker" count (not shown in Table 3).
                                      -16-




     If an increase in the minimum wage reduces employment and the labor force
                                             Tables 2 and 4, then the effect on
by the same percentage, as is suggested by

unemployment would be zero. While the estimated effects on the teenage unemploy-

ment rate (Table 4) are not exactly zero, they are smaller than most reported

in Table 1. To interpret Table 4, consider the last entry in line 1, which cor-

responds to a GLS estimate with a logarithmic estimating equation using the

"basic" set of explanatory variables and the unemployment rate (or its log-

arithm) as the dependent variable. The 0.05 means that a 10 percent increase in

the minimum wage is estimated to increase the teenage unemployment rate by .05

                                     9.0 to 9.05 percent). Even the largest esti-
percentage point (e.g., from, say,

mates suggest that a 10 percent increase in the minimum would increase teenage

unemployment by only about one tenth of one percentage point. Caution is in
                                                     effects. None of them is
order, however, in interpreting these unemployment
                                               in the low t-statistiCs. Never-
estimated with great precision, as reflected
                                         and going to the upper end of the 95
theless, even taking a "high" estimate

percent confidence interval, the estimates are still generally less than three-

tenths of a percentage point.

     Most, though not all, previous studies have found appreciable labor force

withdrawal in response to increases in the minimum wage, so that many of those

 "disemployed" are not found among the "unemployed." The relative strength of

 the labor force withdrawal effect, however, is somewhat surprising, being es-

 sentially the same size (in percentage terms) as the employment effect. It
                                                   studies have obtained similar
 should be noted, however, that several previous

 results (Kaitz, 1970; Lovell, 1972 and 1973; Mattila, 1978; Freeman, 1979), and

 that our finding is quite robust in light of the specification experiments re-

 ported.
                                                         --   1954-69, roughly that

  used in the early studies in Table 1, and the reamining 1970-79 period. Results

 for the early subperiod looked very much like those in Table 2: employment and

 labor force effects of about one
                                    percent, and virtually no unemployment effect.
 In the later period, employment effects
                                           were somewhat larger (centering on
 —1.4 percent), labor force withdrawal smaller (-0.6 percent), and thus unem-

 ployment effects which were much larger (0.6 percentage points). These results

 broadly reinforce our earlier findings, except for the statistically signifi-

 cant unemployment effects in the recent period.



 IV. EXTENSIONS OF THE BASIC ANALYSIS

      The purpose of this Section is to present additional time-series evidence

 on the effects of the minimum wage on employment and
                                                        unemployment of young per-
 sons. Several refinements and extensions of the results in Section III are des-

cribed below.



A.    Estimated Effects of the Minimum Wage on Teenagers,     Race and Sex

     Many previous studies attempted to estimate employment and unemployment

effects of the minimum wage on teenagers separately by race and sex. Indeed,

in many cases the emphasis on these disaggregated results was so strong that

no "adding up" of these results was provided to determine the effect on teen-

agers as a group. For the sake of comparison, this section presents our estimates

of minimum wage effects on teenage labor force status stratified first by race

and then by sex.

     Table 5 contains estimates of the effects of a 10 percent increase in the

minimum wage on the employment of white, nonwhite, male and female teenagers

over the 1954-79 period. The first three lines are estimates derived from our

"basic" specification. 16
                                    -18-




    None of these variables is race- or sex-specific, apart from the fraction

of teenagers who are 16_17.1 In general, the estimated effects for all whites,

all males, and all females are similar to those estimated in Section III for

teenagers as a whole -- a 10 percent increase in the minimum reducing teenage
                                                 nonwhites are quite different;
employment by roughly one percent. Effects for

the point estimates suggesting that increases in the minimum wage actually in-

crease their employment. However, none of the nonwhite effects are estimated

with any precision. Estimates of the magnitude shown here could occur due to

chance alone if the "true" effect were zero; moreover, we cannot reject the

hypothesis that the white-nonwhite difference is due to chance alone.18

     The third, sixth, and ninth lines of Table 5 present estimates of the ef-

fect of increases in the minimum wage on aggregate teenage employment, with

the estimate calculated as a weighted average of the disaggregated results.

The results were generally similar to the "directly-estimated" total effects,
                                                 difference in the two ways of
presented in Table 2, suggesting no systematic

deriving aggregate estimates.

     The effects of a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage on labor force

participation and unemployment are also presented in Table 5. For whites, males
                                                  in response to the minimum wage
and females, labor force participation declines

 in about the same proportion that employment declines, so that unemployment
                                                            by nonwhites also de-
 rates are roughtly unaffected. Labor force participation

 clines. Coupled with the estimated increase in their employment, this implies

 a decline in black unemployment in respose to the minimum wage. The labor force

 effects and the GLS estimates of the unemployment rate effects are not statis-

 tically significant, however. This suggests that, once again, the effects on

 nonwhites are not estimated with adequate precision with these data.

      Welch (1976, pp. 121-122) has noted that population and labor force data
                                      - 19-



 for nonwhites are subject to considerable sampling error, due to the relatively

 small samples of nonwhite teenagers in the Current Population Survey (CPS).

 Since the size of the CPS sample has grown over time, weighting the observations

 by the estimated number of nonwhite teenagers actually surveyed seemed desir-

 able. This would place greater weight on the more recent observations, which

 are presumably subject to smaller sampling errors. Having done this, we found

 the resulting estimates were only slightly closer to the white teenage results.

     While it is often asserted that blacks are more adversely affected than

whites by the minimum wage, previous studies offer quite mixed results on the

issue. We find no support for the assertion, because of an inability to estimate

accurately the effects on nonwhites. In any case, while we do not claim to have

disproven the view that nonwhites are more adversely affected than whites, we

would conclude that such an assertion must rest on theoretical rather than

empirical grounds.



B.   Effects on Full-time Equivalent Employment

     As we have noted elsewhere (Brown, Gilroy and Kohen, 1981), most studies of

employment effects of the minimum wage focus on the number of people employed,

neglecting variations in hours worked per week by those who remain employed. The

handful of studies which have examined the hours-of-work issue have produced

conflicting results.

     One way of addressing the hours-of-work issue is to consider the effect of

the minimum wage on the fraction of those employed who work part time. An al-

ternative approach, which is pursued here, is to convert part-time workers into

full—time equivalent (FTE) employment. Assuming that the average part-time

worker1s workweek is roughly one-half that of the average full-time worker,

FTE employment is defined as the number of full-time workers plus one—half that
                                    -20-




of part-time workers. We then estimated the effect of the minimum wage on FTE

employment. If the minimum wage increases the fraction of those employed who

are part-time workers, its (negative) effect on FTE employment should be larger

than its effect on number of workers employed.

     The findings are summarized in Table 6, which presents estimates based on

the Ibasicu specification and that specfication with the enrollment/population

ratio as an added independent variable. Since data on full-time and part-time

employment of teenagers are available only since 1963, the FTE equations must

be based on that shorter sample period. To keep the comparison between the

standard number employed and FTE employment measures as exact as possible, we

reestimated the previous employment equations based on the 1963-1979 sample

period. Thus, line 1 of Table 6 reproduces the results of estimating the 'basic11

equation using the standard measure across the full (1954-79) sample. Line 2

presents the results of estimating the same equation on the shorter (1963-79)

sample, and line 3 presents the estimated effect of the minimum wage on FTE

employment over the 1963-79 period. Comparing lines 2 and 3, it is apparent

that the effect of the minimum wage on FTE employment is somewhat larger than

its effect on the standard employment measure. Lines 4-6 present analogous

 results, with the enrollment/population ratio also held constant. Again,

the effects in line 6 are a bit larger than those in line 5. Overall, Table 6

 suggests that the effect of a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage is larger
                                                      number of workers. The dif-
 for FTE employment than for employment measured by

 ference is on the order of 0.4 percentage point, though the precise number is

 quite sensitive to the specification   choice.
      More generally, we found that the estimates were quite sensitive to the

 choice of independent variables when a linear specification was used, but more
                                                  numerical values are elusive,
 robust for the logarithmic form. While precise
                                        -21-



 the direction of the results is not: the minimum wage increases the fraction

 of employed teenagers who work part time, so that FTE employment declines more

 than number of teenagers employed in response to an increase in the minimum

wage.



C.      Effects on Employment Status of Young Adults

        All of the results presented thus far have been refinements of an analysis

of the effects of the minimum wage on teenagers. While minimum-wage work is

considerably less common among young adults aged 20-24 than among teenagers

(about 15 percent of young adults worked at or below the minimum wage in

1980, compared with 45 percent of teenagers), one might still anticipate non-

trivial effects on this "next-youngest" group.

        In order to maximize comparability of results for young adults and teen-

agers, the estimated equations for employment/population ratios, labor force/

population ratios, and unemployment rates for young adults were as similar as

possible to the earlier teenage equations. Apart from the obvious differences

(EM/P, LF/P, UR, AF/P, EN/P and POP are based on young adult rather than teen-

age values), the only changes in these equations were:


     (1) Because TR/P and YK are unavailable for young adults, TR/P now refers
          to the fraction of all (labor-force age) persons in training pro-
          grams, and TK and TC are the minimum wage index and coverage index
          using total employment to weight the individual-industry figures;

     (2) The variable, SY, which reflected age composition within the teenage
          group, is deleted;

     C3) In line 6 of Table 7, instead of adding the population share of young
          adults, the population share of teenagers (POPT) is added to the
          equation (because the population share of young adults is already in-
          cluded in the "basic" specification).

on young adult employment are presented in Table 7. The "basic" equations all

yield estimates of approximately 0.25 percent reduction in young-adult employ-

ment (roughly one fourth of the corresponding teenage impact). The estimates

the -0.25 estimate, but range from -.10 to -.60. The relatively large standard

errors of the coverage index, TC, in lines 9 and 10 suggest that it is no
                                                    for young adults than it was
easier to disentangle coverage and level effects

for teenagers.

     Estimated effects of a 10 percent increase on young adult labor force par-

ticipation are also presented in Table 7. The "basic" equations suggest virtually
                                        adults in response to the minimum wage;

more than 0.1 percent in either direction, and are never significant.

      Reduced employment and little change in labor force participation imply

 increased unemployment in response to a minimum wage increase, and that is in-

 deed what is displayed in Table 7. The "basic" specification suggests an in-
                                                                           from

 fications produce fairly similar estimates (with

 range).

      Compared with the results for teenagers as a group in Section III, the

 employment effects are smaller (as we would expect due to the lower incidence

 of minimum wage workers among young adults). We do, however, find unemployment

 effects as well for young adults, which was not the case for teenagers.

 V.    CONCLUSION

       Previous empirical studies had estimated that a 10 percent increase in the

 minimum wage (or in the fraction of workers subject to it) would reduce teenage

 employment by one to three percent. Our own work, which uses a more up-to-date

 and longer sample period than most of these studies, suggests that one percent

 is a reasonable "single-number" estimate of the employment effect.

      Our estimates clustered in a one half to one and one half percent range.

 The lowest numbers were based on GLS estimates and a linear relationship be-

 tween teenage employment and the minimum wage index. The apparent sensitivity

of the estimates to the OLS-GLS choice with the linear functional form is it-

self interesting; most previous studies report OLS estimates, while, in our

data at least, serial correlation of the residuals is quite evident. The high-

est estimates come from double-logarithmic equations with the young adult popu-

lation share or real welfare benefits added as explanatory variables. However,

both of these variables were "wrong-signed" when added, so the revision in

the minimum wage estimate they produce is debatable.

      We also experimented with allowing the relative level and coverage of the

minimum wage to have different effects on teenage employment. Like most previous

studies which made similar attempts, we found "coverage" effects to be rela-

tively weaker than "level" effects. However, the coverage effects were estimated

with little precision, so the restriction that level and coverage have equal

effects could not confidently be rejected. None of the previous studies had

reported attempts to test that restriction.

      We also explored the issue of the timing of responses to minimum wage

increases. Previous studies had assumed either a same-quarter or a short four—

through eight—quarter lagged response. None of the studies which included

lagged variables discussed the effect of that choice. One might expect that
                                       -24-




omitting the lagged terms would lead to umissinghi part of the minimum wage ef-

fect. However, no evidence was found to support that hypothesis. We did, how-

ever, find some evidence that part of the effect of an increase in the minimum

wage is felt after the change is legislated but before it goes into effect.

     Earlier studies had generally found that teenagers, on balance, withdrew

from the labor force in response to increases in the minimum wage. Our results
                                                found sufficient labor force with-
are consistent with this response. Indeed, we

drawal so that employment and labor force were reduced in near-equal propor-

tions; as a result, the unemployment effects of the minimum wage were estimated

to be practically zero. We find the importance of labor force withdrawal in our

estimates surprisingly large (given our employment-effect

 lier period, we would not emphasize this result

 sample estimates.

      In terms of the several refinements and extensions of the teenage results,

 we find little evidence that the effect of the minimum wage on the employment

 of white, male or female teens differed appreciably from the one percent esti-
                                                    (indeed, the estimated effects

dence presented. A similar conclusion would apply to estimated unemployment ef-

fects.

        We also considered the effect of the minimum wage on full-time equivalent

teenage employment and found that it declines somewhat more than the standard

measure of numbers employed in response to the minimum, suggesting a movement

from full-time toward part-time work in response to an increase in the minimum

wage.

        Finally, we examined the effect of a minimum wage increase on young adult

(aged 20-24) labor force status. We found employment effects that tended to be

negative -- a 0.25 percent reduction in young adult employment in response to a

10 percent increase in the minimum -- though these estimates are often not

statistically significant. One would have expected smaller effects for young

adults than for teenagers, if only because fewer young adults are directly

affected by changes in the minimum. We did find statistically significant un-

employment effects (the increase in the minimum wage raising young adult unem-

ployment rates by roughly 0.25 percentage points).

        Overall, our results suggest a modest role for the minimum wage in explain-

ing teenage labor market problems. A ten percent increase in the minimum wage

will reduce teenage employment, probably by one percent. It may increase teen-

age unemployment, but certainly not by the two to three percentage points re-

ported in some earlier papers on the subject.

'Surveys of employers find reports of such responses from some (not all) firms,

but there is no evidence on what fraction of increases in the minimum can be

offset in this way. See U.S. Department of Labor (1959, pp. 28, 59, 107, 142,

206, 241-242) and Converse, et al. (1981, pp. 269-278).

To measure employment effects, Table 1 presents the percent change in employ-

ment due to a 10 percent change in the minimum wage;   i.e. ,   10 times the employ-

ment elasticity of the minimum wage q(E). For studies which regressed the

logarithm of an employment measure (the employment/population ratio [E/P], for
                                                 the coefficient of the minimum
example) on the logarithm of minimum wage (Wm)

wage variable is simply (E). For studies which use a linear rather than a
                                                                  coefficient times
double-logarithmic specification, ri(E) equals the regression

Wm/(E/'P)i where the bar indicates the mean value over the sample period.

     The unemployment effects are the effect of a 10 percent change in the mini-

mum wage on the unemployment rate. For the studies which estimate separate em-

ployment and labor force equations in logarithmic form using the employment!

population ratio (E!P) and labor force participation rate (LIP) as dependent

 variables, the minimum wage coefficients are the employment and labor force

 elasticities q(E) and q(L). Where the equations are linear, the regression co-
                                                           respectively, to derive

     Thus, if the minimum wage increased by 10 percent (IWm/Wm =                    .10),    u ex-

pressed as a decimal is .lOx, and the change in the unemployment rate expressed

as a percent is lOx. For studies in which the dependent variable is the unem-

ployment rate expressed in percentage points, x is calculated as the regression

6The population share variable in the employment equations received less atten-

tion, although roughly half of the studies included it. On statistical grounds,

one might expect larger (negative) minimum wage effects if this variable were

omitted from an employment equation. The population share and minimum wage

variables are apparently positively correlated, and the population share tends

(when included) to have a negative effect on employment/population ratios.



7Note that virtually all of the studies in Table 1 estimate employment equations
                                      -28-


whose dependent variable is the employment-to-population ratio. Thus, even

studies which appear not to introduce supply side variables in the list of in-

dependent variables have effectively included such factors in the dependent

variable. If employment of teenagers is really demand determined, the proper

dependent variable would be employment, not the employment-to-population ratio.

are not due to sampling variation alone, the results of the correction for

benefits per recipient to measure the effects of welfare programs.



13Gramlich has criticized the Kaitz index on different grounds, arguing that

a simple theoretical model implies that the logarithm of employment should be a

linear function of coverage times the logarithm of the relative minimum wage.

Unfortunately, his "relative minimum wage" is the ratio of the minimum wage to

the (unobserved) "equilibrium" wage, so that operationalizing his point is dif-

ficult. Indeed, Gramlich opts for dummy variables to reflect coverage, and re-

ports little success in identifying coverage effects. While we share the concern

on this issue, we have not been able to develop an alternative minimum wage

"variable" which reflects his point. One version we considered was simply in-

cluding coverage multiplied by the logarithm of the relative minimum wage as an

explanatory variable. However, since the relative minimum is less than one, its

logarithm is negative, so that coverage and level effects are constrained to

have opposite effects.
