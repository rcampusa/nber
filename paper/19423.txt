Are teachers impacts on students test scores (“value-added”) a good measure of their quality? One
reason this question has sparked debate is disagreement about whether value-added (VA) measures
provide unbiased estimates of teachers causal impacts on student achievement. We test for bias in
VA using previously unobserved parent characteristics and a quasi-experimental design based on changes
in teaching staff. Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we find
that VA models which control for a students prior test scores exhibit little bias in forecasting teachers
impacts on student achievement.

   How can we measure and improve the quality of teaching in primary schools? One prominent but con-
troversial method is to evaluate teachers based on their impacts on students’ test scores, commonly termed
the “value-added” (VA) approach.1                  School districts from Washington D.C. to Los Angeles have begun
to calculate VA measures and use them to evaluate teachers. Advocates argue that selecting teachers on
the basis of their VA can generate substantial gains in achievement (e.g., Gordon, Kane, and Staiger 2006,
Hanushek 2009), while critics contend that VA measures are poor proxies for teacher quality (e.g., Baker
et al. 2010, Corcoran 2010). The debate about teacher VA stems primarily from two questions. First, do
the differences in test-score gains across teachers measured by VA capture causal impacts of teachers or are
they biased by student sorting? Second, do teachers who raise test scores improve their students’ outcomes
in adulthood or are they simply better at teaching to the test?

   This paper addresses the first of these two questions.2 Prior work has reached conflicting conclusions
about the degree of bias in VA estimates (Kane and Staiger 2008, Rothstein 2010, Kane et al. 2013). Re-
solving this debate is critical for policy because biased VA measures will systematically reward or penalize
teachers based on the mix of students in their classrooms.

   We develop new methods to estimate the degree of bias in VA estimates and implement them using
information from two administrative databases. The first is a dataset on test scores and teacher assignments
in grades 3-8 from a large urban school district in the U.S. These data cover more than 2.5 million students
and include over 18 million tests of math and English achievement spanning 1989-2009. We match 90%
of the observations in the school district data to selected data from United States tax records spanning
1996-2011. These data contain information on parent characteristics such as household income, retirement
savings, and mother’s age at child’s birth.

   We begin our analysis by constructing VA estimates for the teachers in our data. We predict each teacher’s
VA in a given school year based on the mean test scores of students she taught in other years. We control for
student characteristics such as prior test scores and demographic variables when constructing this prediction
to separate the teacher’s impact from (observable) student selection. Our approach to estimating VA closely
parallels that currently used by school districts, except in one respect. Existing value-added models typically
assume that each teacher’s quality is fixed over time and thus place equal weight on test scores in all classes
taught by the teacher when forecasting teacher quality. In practice, test scores from more recent classes are
better predictors of current teacher quality, indicating that teacher quality fluctuates over time. We account
for such “drift” in teacher quality by estimating the autocovariance of scores across classrooms taught by a

     1 Value-added models of teacher quality were pioneered by Hanushek (1971) and Murnane (1975). More recent examples include Rockoff
(2004), Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005), Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander (2007), and Kane and Staiger (2008).
     2 We address the second question in our companion paper (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2014). There are also other important concerns about
VA. Most importantly, as with other measures of labor productivity, the signal in value-added measures may be degraded by behavioral responses
if high-stakes incentives are put in place (Barlevy and Neal 2012).


                                                                       1
given teacher non-parametrically; intuitively, we regress scores in year t on average scores in other years,
allowing the coefficients to vary across different lags. Our VA model implies that a 1 standard deviation
(SD) improvement in teacher VA raises normalized test scores by approximately 0.14 SD in math and 0.1
SD in English, slightly larger than the estimates in prior studies that do not account for drift.
   Next, we turn to our central question: are the VA measures we construct “unbiased” predictors of teacher
quality? To define “bias” formally, consider a hypothetical experiment in which we randomly assign stu-
dents to teachers, as in Kane and Staiger (2008). Let                       denote the mean test score impact of being randomly
assigned to a teacher who is rated one unit higher in VA based on observational data from prior school years.
We define the degree of “forecast bias” in a VA model as B D 1                             . We say that VA estimates are “forecast
unbiased” if B D 0, i.e. if teachers whose estimated VA is one unit higher do in fact cause students’ test
scores to increase by one unit on average.
   We develop two methods to estimate the degree of forecast bias in VA estimates.                                       First, we estimate
forecast bias based on the degree of selection on observable characteristics excluded from the VA model.
We generate predicted test scores for each student based on parent characteristics from the tax data, such as
family income, and regress the predicted scores on teacher VA. For our baseline VA model – which controls
for a rich set of prior student, class, and school level scores and demographics – we find that forecast bias
from omitting parent characteristics is at most 0.3% at the top of the 95% confidence interval. Using a
similar approach, we find that forecast bias from omitting twice-lagged scores from the VA model is at most
2.6%.
   In interpreting these results, it is important to note that children of higher-income parents do get higher VA
teachers on average. However, such sorting does not lead to biased estimates of teacher VA for two reasons.
First, and most importantly, the correlation between VA estimates and parent characteristics vanishes once
we control for test scores in the prior school year. Second, even the unconditional correlation between parent
income and VA estimates is small: we estimate that a $10,000 increase in parent income is associated with
less than a 0:0001 SD improvement in teacher VA (measured in student test-score SD’s).3 One explanation
for why sorting is so limited is that 85% of the variation in teacher VA is within rather than between schools.
Since most sorting occurs through the choice of schools, parents may have little scope to steer their children
toward higher VA teachers.
   While our first approach shows that forecast bias due to sorting on certain observable predictors of stu-
dent achievement is minimal, bias due to other unobservable characteristics could still be substantial. To
obtain a more definitive estimate of forecast bias that accounts for unobservables, we develop a quasi-

    3 An auxiliary implication of this result is that differences in teacher quality explain a small share of the achievement gap between high- and
low-SES students. This is not because teachers are unimportant – one could close most of the achievement gap by assigning highly effective
teachers to low-SES students – but rather because teacher VA does not differ substantially across schools in the district we study.


                                                                        2
experimental analog to the ideal experiment of random student assignment. Our quasi-experimental design
exploits teacher turnover at the school-grade level for identification. To understand the design, suppose a
high-VA 4th grade teacher moves from school A to another school in 1995. Because of this staff change,
4th graders in school A in 1995 will have lower VA teachers on average than the previous cohort of students
in school A. If VA estimates have predictive content, we would expect 4th grade test scores for the 1995
cohort to be lower on average than the previous cohort.
  Using event studies of teacher arrivals and departures, we find that mean test scores change sharply across
cohorts as predicted when very high or low VA teachers enter or exit a school-grade cell. We estimate the
amount of forecast bias by comparing changes in average test scores across consecutive cohorts of children
within a school to changes in the mean value-added of the teaching staff. The forecasted changes in mean
scores closely match observed changes. The point estimate of forecast bias in our preferred specification is
2.6% and is not statistically distinguishable from 0. The upper bound on the 95% confidence interval for
the degree of bias is 9.1%.
  Our quasi-experimental design rests on the identification assumption that high-frequency teacher turnover
within school-grade cells is uncorrelated with student and school characteristics. This assumption is plausi-
ble insofar as parents are unlikely to immediately switch their children to a different school simply because a
single teacher leaves or arrives. Moreover, we show that changes in mean teacher quality in a given subject
(e.g., math) are uncorrelated with both prior scores in that subject and contemporaneous scores in the other
subject (e.g., English), supporting the validity of the research design.
  We investigate which of the controls in our baseline VA model are most important to account for student
sorting by estimating forecast bias using our quasi-experimental design for several commonly used VA
specifications. We find that simply controlling for a student’s own lagged test scores generates a point
estimate of forecast bias of 5% that is not significantly different from 0.                              In contrast, models that omit
lagged test score controls generate forecast bias exceeding 40%. Thus, most of the sorting of students to
teachers that is relevant for future test achievement is captured by prior test scores. This result is reassuring
for the application of VA models because virtually all value-added models used in practice control for prior
scores.
  Our quasi-experimental method provides a simple, low-cost tool for assessing bias in various settings.4
For instance, Kane, Staiger, and Bacher-Hicks (2014) apply our method to data from the Los Angeles
Unified School District (LAUSD). They find that VA estimates that control for lagged scores also exhibit
no forecast bias in LAUSD, even though the dispersion in teacher VA is much greater in LAUSD than in the
district we study. More generally, the methods developed here could be applied to assess the accuracy of

personnel evaluation metrics in a variety of professions beyond teaching.
  Our results reconcile the findings of experimental studies (Kane and Staiger 2008, Kane et al. 2013) with
Rothstein’s (2010) findings on bias in VA estimates. We replicate Rothstein’s finding that there is small
but statistically significant grouping of students on lagged test score gains and show that this particular
source of selection generates minimal forecast bias. Based on his findings, Rothstein warns that selection
on unobservables could potentially generate substantial bias. We directly evaluate the degree of forecast
bias due to unobservables using a quasi-experimental analog of Kane and Staiger’s (2008) experiment. Like
Kane and Staiger, we find no evidence of forecast bias due to unobservables. Hence, we conclude that VA
estimates which control for prior test scores exhibit little bias despite the grouping of students on lagged
gains documented by Rothstein.
  The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we formalize how we construct VA estimates and define
concepts of bias in VA estimates. Section II describes the data sources and provides summary statistics.
We construct teacher VA estimates in Section III. Sections IV and V present estimates of forecast bias for
our baseline VA model using the two methods described above. Section VI compares the forecast bias of
alternative VA models. Section VII explains how our results relate to findings in the prior literature. Section
VIII concludes.

                                     I.   Conceptual Framework and Methods


  In this section, we develop an estimator for teacher VA and formally define our measure of bias in VA
estimates. We begin by setting up a simple statistical model of test scores.

                                                A.        Statistical Model


  School principals assign each student i in school year t to a classroom c D c.i; t/. Principals then assign
a teacher j .c/ to each classroom c. For simplicity, assume that each teacher teaches one class per year, as
in elementary schools. Let j D j .c.i; t// denote student i’s teacher in year t and          jt   represent the teacher’s
“value-added” in year t, i.e. teacher j’s impact on test scores. We scale teacher VA so that the average
teacher has value-added     jt   D 0 and the effect of a 1 unit increase in teacher VA on end-of-year test scores
is 1.
  Student i’s test score in year t, Ait , is given by

(1)                                                Ait         D       Xit C        it

(2)                                        where     it        D       jt   C   c    "it
                                                                                    Ce

Here, Xit denotes observable determinants of student achievement, such as lagged test scores and family
characteristics. We decompose the error term              it   into three components: teacher value-added      jt ,   exoge-

                                                                   4
nous class shocks         c,    and idiosyncratic student-level variation e
                                                                          "it . Let "it D                   c    "it denote the unobserved
                                                                                                                Ce
error in scores unrelated to teacher quality. Student characteristics Xit and "it may be correlated with                                                jt .

Accounting for such selection is the key challenge in obtaining unbiased estimates of                                     jt .

   The model in (1) permits teacher quality                   jt    to fluctuate stochastically over time. We do not place any
restrictions on the stochastic processes that                jt    and "it follow except for the following assumption.

Assumption 1 [Stationarity] Teacher VA and student achievement follow a stationary process:

(3)              E[    jt jt]   D E["it jt] D 0, Cov.        jt ;     j;tCs /   D   s,   Cov."it ; "i;tCs / D       "s   for all t

Assumption 1 requires that (1) mean teacher quality does not vary across calendar years and (2) the correla-
tion of teacher quality, class shocks, and student shocks across any pair of years depends only on the amount
of time that elapses between those years. This assumption simplifies the estimation of teacher VA by reduc-
                                                                                                                                 2
ing the number of parameters to be estimated. Note that the variance of teacher effects,                                             D V ar .   jt /,   is
constant across periods under stationarity.

                                                 B.    Estimating Teacher Value-Added


   We develop an estimator for teacher value-added in year t (                           jt )   based on mean test scores in prior classes
                           5
taught by teacher j.             Our approach closely parallels existing estimators for value-added (e.g., Kane and
Staiger 2008), except that it accounts for drift in teacher quality over time. To simplify exposition, we
derive the estimator for the case in which data on test scores is available for t years for all teachers, where
all classes have n students, and where each teacher teaches one class per year. In Appendix A, we provide
a step-by-step guide to implementation (along with corresponding Stata code) that accounts for differences
in class size, multiple classrooms per year, and other technical issues that arise in practice.
   We construct our estimator in three steps. First, we regress test scores Ait on Xit and compute test score
residuals adjusting for observables. Next, we estimate the best linear predictor of mean test score residuals
in classrooms in year t based on mean test score residuals in prior years, using a technique analogous to an
OLS regression. Finally, we use the coefficients of the best linear predictor to predict each teacher’s VA in
year t. We now describe these steps formally.
   Let the residual student test score after removing the effect of observable characteristics be denoted by

(4)                                                 Ait D Ait            Xit D      jt   C "it .

We estimate          using variation across students taught by the same teacher using an OLS regression of the

   5 To maximize statistical precision, we use data from all other years – both in the past and future – to predict VA in year t in our empirical
implementation. To simplify notation, we present the derivation in this section for the case in which we only use prior data to predict VA.


                                                                         5

(5)                                                             Ait D              j   C Xit ,

where       j   is a teacher fixed effect. Our approach of estimating                                       using within teacher variation differs
from prior studies, which typically use both within- and between-teacher variation to estimate                                                  (e.g., Kane,
Rockoff, and Staiger 2008, Jacob, Lefgren and Sims 2010). If teacher VA is correlated with X it , estimates
of    in a specification without teacher fixed effects overstate the impact of the X ’s because part of the teacher
effect is attributed to the covariates.6 For example, suppose X includes school fixed effects. Estimating
without teacher fixed effects would attribute all the test score differences across schools to the school fixed
effects, leaving mean teacher quality normalized to be the same across all schools. With school fixed effects,
estimating         within teacher requires a set of teachers to teach in multiple schools, as in Mansfield (2013).
These switchers allow us to identify the school fixed effects independent of teacher effects and obtain a
cardinal global ranking of teachers across schools.

    6 Teacher fixed effects account for correlation between X and mean teacher VA. If X is correlated with fluctuations in teacher VA across
                                                                 it                          it
years due to drift, then one may still understate teachers’ effects even with fixed effects. We show in Table 6 below that dropping teacher fixed
effects when estimating (5) yields VA estimates that have a correlation of 0.98 with our baseline estimates because most of the variation in X it is
within classrooms. Since sorting to teachers based on their average impacts turns out to be quantitatively unimportant in practice, sorting based on
fluctuations in those impacts is likely to have negligible effects on VA estimates.

     Finally, using the estimates of               , we predict teacher j’s VA in period t as

Note that the VA estimates in (7) are leave-year-out (jackknife) measures of teacher quality, similar to those
in Jacob, Lefgren and Sims (2010), but with an adjustment for drift. This is important for our analysis
below because regressing student outcomes in year t on teacher VA estimates without leaving out the data
from year t when estimating VA would introduce the same estimation errors on both the left and right hand
side of the regression and produce biased estimates of teachers’ causal impacts.7
     Special Cases. The formula for b jt in (7) nests two special cases that help build intuition for the general
case. First, consider predicting a teacher’s impact in year t using data from only the previous year t                                                     1. In

The shrinkage factor             in this equation incorporates two forces that determine                                             in the general case. First,
because past test scores are a noisy signal of teacher quality, the VA estimate is shrunk toward the sample
mean (       jt   D 0) to reduce mean-squared error.                       Second, because teacher quality drifts over time, the
predicted effect differs from past performance. For instance, if teacher quality follows a mean-reverting
process, past test scores are further shrunk toward the mean to reduce the influence of transitory shocks to
teacher quality.
     Second, consider the case where teacher quality is fixed over time (                                           jt   D       j   for all t) and the student
and class level errors are i.i.d. This is the case considered by most prior studies of value-added. Here,

and Staiger (2008) in the case with constant class size.8 Here, the signal to noise ratio                                                        does not vary

    7 This is the reason that Rothstein (2010) finds that “fifth grade teachers whose students have above average fourth grade gains have systemati-
cally lower estimated value-added than teachers whose students underperformed in the prior year.” Students who had unusually high fourth grade
gains due to idiosyncratic, non-persistent factors (e.g., measurement error) will tend to have lower than expected fifth grade gains, making their fifth
grade teacher have a lower VA estimate.
    8 Kane and Staiger (2008) derive (9) using an Empirical Bayes approach instead of a best linear predictor. If teacher VA, class shocks, and
student errors follow independent Normal distributions, the posterior mean of jt coincides with (9). Analogously, (7) can be interpreted as
the posterior expectation of jt when teacher VA follows a multivariate Normal distribution whose variance-covariance matrix controls the drift


                                                                           7
across years because teacher performance in any year is equally predictive of performance in year t. Be-
cause years are interchangeable, VA depends purely on mean test scores over prior years, again shrunk
toward the sample mean to reduce mean-squared error.9

  Importantly, b jt D E AN jt j A j t simply represents the best linear predictor of the future test scores

expected causal effect of teacher j on students’ scores in year t, E jt j A j t , because part of the prediction
could be driven by systematic sorting of students to teachers. We now turn to evaluating the degree to which
b jt measures a teacher’s causal impact.

                                                          C.     Definition of Bias


   An intuitive definition of bias is to ask whether VA estimates b jt accurately predict differences in the
mean test scores of students who are randomly assigned to teachers in year t, as in Kane and Staiger (2008).
Consider an OLS regression of residual test scores Ait in year t on b jt (constructed from observational data
in prior years) in such an experiment:

(10)                                                     Ait D      t   C b jt C       it


Because E "it j b jt D 0 under random assignment of students in year t, the coefficient                                        measures the
relationship between true teacher effects                 jt   and estimated teacher effects b jt :

                                                    Cov Ait ; b jt               Cov        jt ; b jt
(11)                                                                         D                          .
                                                       V ar b jt                  V ar b jt

We define the degree of bias in VA estimates based on this regression coefficient as follows.

Definition 1. The amount of forecast bias in a VA estimator b jt is B b jt D 1                                      .

   Forecast bias determines the mean impact of changes in the estimated VA of the teaching staff. A policy
that increases estimated teacher VA b jt by 1 standard deviation raises student test scores by .1                                 B/ .b jt /,
where .b jt / is the standard deviation of VA estimates scaled in units of student test scores. If B D 0, b jt
provides an unbiased forecast of teacher quality in the sense that an improvement in estimated VA of 1b jt
has the same causal impact on test scores as an increase in true teacher VA 1                               jt   of the same magnitude.10
   Two issues should be kept in mind when interpreting estimates of forecast bias. First, VA estimates can
be forecast-unbiased even if children with certain characteristics (e.g., those with higher ability) are system-
process.
    9 In our original working paper (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2011b), we estimated value-added using (9). Our qualitative conclusions were
similar, but our out-of-sample forecasts of teachers’ impacts were attenuated because we did not account for drift.
   10 Ex-post, any estimate of VA can be made forecast unbiased by redefining VA as b0 D .1 B/b . However, the causal effect of a policy that
                                                                                       jt            jt
raises the estimated VA of teachers is unaffected by such a rescaling, as the effect of a 1 SD improvement in b0jt is still .1 B/ .b jt /. Hence,
given the standard deviation of VA estimates, the degree of forecast bias is informative about the potential impacts of improving estimated VA.


                                                                         8
atically assigned to certain teachers. Forecast unbiasedness only requires that the observable characteristics
Xit used to construct test score residuals Ait are sufficiently rich that the remaining unobserved heterogene-
ity in test scores "it is balanced across teachers with different VA estimates. Second, even if VA estimates
b jt are forecast unbiased, one can potentially improve forecasts of                          jt   by incorporating other information
beyond past test scores. For example, data on principal ratings or teacher characteristics could potentially
reduce the mean-squared error of forecasts of teacher quality. Hence, the fact that a VA estimate is forecast
unbiased does not necessarily imply that it is the optimal forecast of teacher quality given all the information
that may be available to school districts.
   An alternative definition of bias, which we term “teacher-level bias,” asks whether the VA estimate for
each teacher converges to her true quality as estimation error vanishes, as in Rothstein (2009). We define
teacher-level bias and formalize its connection to forecast bias in Appendix B. Teacher-level unbiasedness
is more challenging to estimate and is a stronger requirement than forecast unbiasedness: some teachers
could be systematically overrated relative to others even if forecasts based on VA estimates are accurate on
average. However, forecast-unbiased VA estimates can be biased at the teacher level only in the knife-edge
case in which the covariance between the bias in each teacher’s VA estimate and true VA perfectly offsets
the variance in true VA (see Appendix B). Hence, if VA estimates obtained from a pre-specified value-
added model turn out to be forecast unbiased, they are unlikely to be biased at the teacher level.11                                       We
therefore focus on estimating B and testing if VA estimates from existing models are forecast unbiased in
the remainder of the paper.

                                                                 II.   Data


   We draw information from two databases: administrative school district records and federal income tax
records. This section describes the two data sources and the structure of the linked analysis dataset and then
provides descriptive statistics.

                                                        A.    School District Data


   We obtain information on students’ test scores and teacher assignments from the administrative records
of a large urban school district. These data span the school years 1988-1989 through 2008-2009 and cover
roughly 2.5 million children in grades 3-8. For simplicity, we refer below to school years by the year in
which the spring term occurs (e.g., the school year 1988-1989 is 1989).
   Test Scores. The data include approximately 18 million test scores. Test scores are available for English

   11 This logic relies on having a pre-specified VA model that is not changed ex-post after observing estimates of forecast bias. If we were to
redefine our VA estimates after estimating forecast bias as b0jt D .1 B/b jt , then b0jt would be forecast unbiased by construction. However,
teacher-level bias in b0jt is no longer a knife-edge case because we have introduced a free parameter into the VA estimation procedure that is
mechanically chosen to offset the excess variance created by teacher-level bias.


                                                                       9
language arts and math for students in grades 3-8 in every year from the spring of 1989 to 2009, with the
exception of 7th grade English scores in 2002.12
   The testing regime varies over the 20 years we study. In the early and mid 1990s, all tests were specific
to the district. Starting at the end of the 1990s, the tests in grades 4 and 8 were administered as part of
a statewide testing system, and all tests in grades 3-8 became statewide in 2006 as required under the No
Child Left Behind law. All tests were administered in late April or May during the early and mid 1990s.
Statewide tests were sometimes given earlier in the school year (e.g., February) during the latter years of
our data.
   Because of this variation in testing regimes, we follow prior work by normalizing the official scale scores
from each exam to have mean zero and standard deviation one by year and grade. The within-grade variation
in achievement in the district we study is comparable to the within-grade variation nationwide, so our results
can be compared to estimates from other samples.13
   Demographics. The dataset contains information on ethnicity, gender, age, receipt of special education
services, and limited English proficiency for the school years 1989 through 2009. The database used to
code special education services and limited English proficiency changed in 1999, creating a break in these
series that we account for in our analysis by interacting these two measures with a post-1999 indicator.
Information on free and reduced price lunch is available starting in school year 1999.                                           These missing
data issues are not a serious problem because our estimates of forecast bias are insensitive to excluding
demographic characteristics from the VA model entirely.
   Teachers. The dataset links students in grades 3-8 to classrooms and teachers from 1991 through 2009.14
This information is derived from a data management system which was phased in over the early 1990s, so
not all schools are included in the first few years of our sample. In addition, data on course teachers for
middle and junior high school students—who, unlike students in elementary schools, are assigned different
teachers for math and English—are more limited. Course teacher data are unavailable prior to the school
year 1994, then grow in coverage to roughly 60% by 1998, and stabilize at approximately 85% after 2003.
To ensure that our estimates are not biased by the missing data, we show that our conclusions remain very
similar in a subsample of school-grade-subject cells with no missing data (see Table 5 below).
   Sample Restrictions. Starting from the raw dataset, we make a series of restrictions that parallel those

   12 We also have data on math and English test scores in grade 2 from 1991-1994, which we use only when evaluating sorting on lagged test score
gains. Because these observations constitute a very small fraction of our sample, excluding them has little impact on our results.
   13 The standard deviation of 4th and 8th grade English and math achievement in this district ranges from roughly 95 percent to 105 percent of the
national standard deviation on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, based on data from 2003 and 2009, the earliest and most recent
years for which NAEP data are available. Mean scores are significantly lower than the national average, as expected given the urban setting of the
district.
   14 5% of students switch classrooms or schools in the middle of a school year. We assign these students to the classrooms in which they took the
test to obtain an analysis dataset with one observation per student-year-subject. However, when defining class and school-level means of student
characteristics (such as fraction eligible for free lunch), we account for such switching by weighting students by the fraction of the year they spent
in that class or school.


                                                                         10
in prior work to obtain our primary school district sample. First, because our estimates of teacher value-
added always condition on prior test scores, we restrict our sample to grades 4-8, where prior test scores
are available. Second, we exclude the 6% of observations in classrooms where more than 25 percent of
students are receiving special education services, as these classrooms may be taught by multiple teachers
or have other special teaching arrangements. We also drop the 2% of observations where the student is
receiving instruction at home, in a hospital, or in a school serving solely disabled students. Third, we drop
classrooms with less than 10 students or more than 50 students as well as teachers linked with more than
200 students in a single grade, because such students are likely to be mis-linked to classrooms or teachers
(0.5% of observations). Finally, when a teacher is linked to students in multiple schools during the same
year, which occurs for 0.3% of observations, we use only the links for the school where the teacher is listed
as working according to human resources records and set the teacher as missing in the other schools.

                                                                 B.    Tax Data

   We obtain information on parent characteristics from U.S. federal income tax returns spanning 1996-
2011.15       The school district records were linked to the tax data using an algorithm based on standard
identifiers (date of birth, state of birth, gender, and names) described in Appendix C, after which individual
identifiers were removed to protect confidentiality. 88.6% of the students and 89.8% of student-subject-year
observations in the sample used to estimate value-added were matched to the tax data, i.e. uniquely linked
to a social security record or tax form as described in Appendix C. Students were then linked to parents
based on the earliest 1040 form filed between tax years 1996 and 2011 on which the student was claimed as
a dependent. We identify parents for 97.6% of the observations in the analysis dataset conditional on being
matched to the tax data.16 We are able to link almost all children to their parents because almost all parents
file a tax return at some point between 1996 and 2012 to obtain a tax refund on their withheld taxes and the
Earned Income Tax Credit.
   In this paper, we use the tax data to obtain information on five time-invariant parent characteristics, defined
as follows. We define parental household income as mean Adjusted Gross Income (capped at $117,000,
the 95th percentile in our sample) between 2005 and 2007 for the primary filer who first claimed the child;
measuring parent income in other years yields very similar results (not reported). For years in which parents
did not file a tax return, they are assigned an income of 0. We measure income in 2010 dollars, adjusting
for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.
   We define marital status, home ownership, and 401(k) saving as indicators for whether the first primary
  15 Here and in what follows, the year refers to the tax year, i.e. the calendar year in which income is earned. In most cases, tax returns for tax
year t are filed during the calendar year t C 1.
  16 Consistent with this statistic, Chetty et al. (2014, Appendix Table I) show that virtually all children in the U.S. population are claimed as
dependents at some point during their childhood. Note that our definition of parents is based on who claims the child as a dependent, and thus may
not reflect the biological parent of the child.


                                                                        11
filer who claims the child ever files a joint tax return, makes a mortgage interest payment (based on data
from 1040’s for filers and 1099’s for non-filers), or makes a 401(k) contribution (based on data from W-2’s)
between 2005 and 2007.
   We define mother’s age at child’s birth using data from Social Security Administration records on birth
dates for parents and children. For single parents, we define the mother’s age at child’s birth using the age
of the filer who first claimed the child, who is typically the mother but is sometimes the father or another
relative.17 When a child cannot be matched to a parent, we define all parental characteristics as zero, and
we always include a dummy for missing parents in regressions that include parent characteristics.

                                                         C.    Summary Statistics


   The linked school district and tax record analysis dataset has one row per student per subject (math or
English) per school year, as illustrated in Appendix Table 1.                           Each observation in the analysis dataset
contains the student’s test score in the relevant subject test, demographic information, teacher assignment,
and time-invariant parent characteristics. We organize the data in this format so that each row contains
information on a treatment by a single teacher conditional on pre-determined characteristics. We account
for the fact that each student appears multiple times in the dataset by clustering standard errors as described
in Section III.
   After imposing the sample restrictions described above, the linked dataset contains 10.7 million student-
year-subject observations.             We use this “core sample” of 10.7 million observations to construct quasi-
experimental estimates of forecast bias, which do not require any additional controls. 9.1 million records
in the core sample have information on teacher assignment and 7.6 million have information on teachers,
lagged test scores, and the other controls needed to estimate our baseline VA model.
   Table 1 reports summary statistics for the 7.6 million observation sample used to estimate value-added
(which includes those with missing parent characteristics). Note that the summary statistics are student-
school year-subject means and thus weight students who are in the district for a longer period of time more
heavily, as does our empirical analysis. There are 1.37 million students in this sample and each student has
5.6 subject-school year observations on average.
   The mean test score in the sample used to estimate VA is positive and has a standard deviation below
1 because we normalize the test scores in the full population that includes students in special education
classrooms and schools (who typically have lower test scores). 80% of students are eligible for free or
reduced price lunches. For students whom we match to parents, mean parent household income is $40,800,
while the median is $31,700.                Though our sample includes more low income households than would a

  17 We set the mother’s age at child’s birth to missing for 78,007 observations in which the implied mother’s age at birth based on the claiming
parent’s date of birth is below 13 or above 65, or where the date of birth is missing entirely from SSA records.


                                                                      12
nationally representative sample, it still includes a substantial number of higher income households, allowing
us to analyze the impacts of teachers across a broad range of the income distribution. The standard deviation
of parent income is $34,300, with 10% of parents earning more than $100,000.

                                                     III.    Value-Added Estimates

   We estimate teacher VA using the methodology in Section I.B in three steps: (1) construct student test
score residuals, (2) estimate the autocovariance of scores across classes taught by a given teacher, and (3)
predict VA for each teacher in each year using test score data from other years.
   Test Score Residuals. Within each subject (math and English) and school-level (elementary and middle),
we construct test score residuals Ait by regressing raw standardized test scores Ait on a vector of covariates
Xit and teacher fixed effects, as in (5). Our baseline control vector Xit is similar to Kane, Rockoff, and
Staiger (2008). We control for prior test scores using a cubic polynomial in prior-year scores in math and
a cubic in prior-year scores in English, and we interact these cubics with the student’s grade level to permit
flexibility in the persistence of test scores as students age.18 We also control for students’ ethnicity, gender,
age, lagged suspensions and absences, and indicators for special education, limited English proficiency,
and grade repetition. We also include the following class- and school-level controls: (1) cubics in class
and school-grade means of prior-year test scores in math and English (defined based on those with non-
missing prior scores) each interacted with grade, (2) class and school-year means of all the other individual
covariates, (3) class size and class-type indicators (honors, remedial), and (4) grade and year dummies.
Importantly, our control vector Xit consists entirely of variables from the school district dataset.19
   Auto-Covariance Vector. Next, we estimate the auto-covariance of mean test score residuals across classes
taught in different years by a given teacher, again separately for each subject and school-level. Exploiting
the stationarity assumption in (3), we use all available classrooms with a time span of s years between them
to estimate       As   D Cov. AN jt ; AN jt s /, weighting by the total number of students in each pair of classes. In
middle school, where teachers teach multiple classes per year, we estimate                                  As   after collapsing the data
to the teacher-year level by calculating precision-weighted means across the classrooms as described in
Appendix A.
                                                            As
   Figure 1 plots the autocorrelations rs D                 2    for each subject and school level; the values underlying this

from year s, the VA estimate for teacher j in year t would simply be b jt D rs A j;t s , since rs D                                  D    As
                                                                                                                                          2    , as

   18 We exclude observations with missing data on current or prior scores in the subject for which we are estimating VA. We also exclude
classrooms that have fewer than 7 observations with current and lagged scores in the relevant subject (2% of observations) to avoid estimating VA
based on very few observations. When prior test scores in the other subject are missing, we set the other subject prior score to 0 and include an
indicator for missing data in the other subject interacted with the controls for prior own-subject test scores.
   19 We do not control for teacher experience in our baseline specification because doing so complicates our quasi-experimental teacher switching
analysis, as we would have to track changes in both teacher experience and VA net of experience. However, we show in Table 6 below that the
correlation between our baseline VA estimates and VA estimates that control for experience is 0.99.


                                                                       13
shown in (8). Hence, rs represents the “reliability” of mean class test scores for predicting teacher quality
s years later. The reliability of VA estimates decays over time: more recent test scores are better predictors
of current teacher performance. For example, in elementary school, reliability declines from r1 D 0:43 in
the first year to r7 D 0:25 in math after seven years, and remains roughly stable for s > 7. The decay in rs
over a period of 5-7 years followed by stability beyond that point implies that teacher quality includes both
a permanent component and a transitory component. The transitory component may arise from variation in
teaching assignments, curriculum, or skill (Goldhaber and Hansen 2010, Jackson 2010).20
   In middle school, we can estimate the within-year covariance of test score residuals                                        A0   because teachers
teach multiple classes per year. Under the assumption that class and student level shocks are i.i.d., this
within-year covariance corresponds to the variance of teacher effects. We estimate the standard deviation of
                     p                                                                                      21
teacher effects,   D     A0 , to be 0:098 in English and 0:134 in math in middle school (Table 2, Panel B).

In elementary school,              A0   is unidentified because teachers teach only one class per year. Conceptually, we
cannot distinguish the variance of idiosyncratic class shocks from unforecasted innovations in teacher effects
                                                                                               p
when teachers teach only one class per year. However, we can obtain a lower bound on       of      A1 because

  A0         A1 .   This bound implies that                is at least 0:113 in English and at least 0:149 in math in elementary
school (second-to-last row of Panel B of Table 2). To obtain a point estimate of                                               , we fit a quadratic
function to the log of the first seven covariances within each subject in elementary school (listed in Table
2, Panel A) and extrapolate to 0 to estimate                       A0 .   This method yields estimates of                      of 0:124 in English
and 0:163 in math, as shown in the final row of Table 2, Panel B.22 The point estimates are close to the
lower bounds because the rate of drift across one year is small. Our estimates of the standard deviations of
teacher effects are slightly larger than those in prior studies (e.g., Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger 2008, Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff 2011b) because the earlier estimates were attenuated by drift.
   Prediction of VA. We use the estimated autocovariance vectors in Table 2 to predict teacher VA. Since
there is no trend in reliability after 7 periods and because the precision of the estimates falls beyond that
point, we fix         As   D     A7   for s > 7 in all subject and school levels when estimating VA. We predict each
teacher’s VA in each year t using test score residuals from all years (both past and the future) except year
t. For example, when predicting teachers’ effects on student outcomes in year t D 1995 (b j;1995 ), we
estimate VA based on all years excluding 1995. We construct these estimates using the formula in (7) with
an adjustment for the variation in the number of students per class and the number of classes per year (for

   20 Prior studies, which do not account for drift, typically estimate reliability as the correlation between mean scores for a random pair of classes
in different years (e.g., Kane and Staiger 2008, Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2011b). That method yields an estimate of the mean value of rs
over the years available in the dataset. A recent summary (McCaffrey et al. 2009) finds reliability in the range of 0.2–0.5 for elementary school
and 0.3–0.7 for middle school teachers, consistent with the estimates in Figure 1.
   21 As is standard in the literature, in this paper we scale value-added in units of student test scores, i.e., a 1 unit increase in value-added refers to
a teacher whose VA is predicted to raise student test scores by 1 SD.
   22 Applying the same quadratic extrapolation to the middle school data yields estimates of            of 0:134 in math and 0:079 in English. These
estimates are fairly close to the true values estimated from the within-year covariance, supporting the extrapolation in elementary school.


                                                                            14
middle school) as described in Appendix A.23
   The empirical distributions of our teacher VA estimates are plotted in Appendix Figure 1. The standard
deviation of b jt is 0:116 in math and 0:080 in English in elementary school; the corresponding SD’s are
0:092 and 0:042 in middle school. The standard deviations are smaller than the true SD of teacher effects
because the best linear predictor shrinks VA estimates toward the sample mean to minimize mean-squared-
error.
   Out-of-Sample Forecasts. Under the stationarity assumption in (3), an OLS regression of Ait on b jt –
the best-linear predictor of Ait – should yield a coefficient of 1 by construction. We confirm that this is
the case in Column 1 of Table 3, which reports estimates from a univariate OLS regression of test score
residuals Ait on b jt in the sample used to estimate the VA model. We include fixed effects for subject
(math vs. English) by school-level (elementary vs. middle) in this and all subsequent regressions to obtain a
single regression coefficient that is identified purely from variation within the subject-by-school-level cells.
We cluster standard errors at the school-by-cohort level (where cohort is defined as the year in which a
child entered kindergarten) to adjust for correlated errors across students within classrooms and the multiple
observations for each student in different grades and subjects.24 The point estimate of the coefficient on b jt
is 0:998 and the 95% confidence interval is .0:986; 1:010/.
   Figure 2a plots the relationship between Ait and b jt non-parametrically, dividing the VA estimates b jt
into twenty equal-size groups (vingtiles) and plotting the mean value of Ait in each bin.25 This binned
scatter plot provides a non-parametric representation of the conditional expectation function but does not
show the underlying variance in the individual-level data. The regression coefficient and standard error
reported in this and all subsequent figures are estimated on the micro data (not the binned averages), with
standard errors clustered by school-cohort. The conditional expectation function in Figure 2a is almost
perfectly linear. Teacher VA has a 1-1 relationship with test score residuals throughout the distribution,
showing that the linear prediction model fits the data well.
   The relationship between b jt and students’ test scores in Figure 2a could be driven by the causal impact
of teachers on achievement (                jt )   or persistent differences in student characteristics across teachers ("it ).
For instance, b jt may forecast students’ test scores in other years simply because some teachers are always
assigned students with higher or lower income parents. In the next two sections, we estimate the degree to
which the relationship in Figure 2a reflects teachers’ causal effects vs. bias due to student sorting.

   23 Among the classrooms with the requisite controls to estimate value-added (e.g., lagged test scores), we are unable to predict teacher VA for
9% of student-subject-year observations because their teachers are observed in the data for only one year.
   24 In our original working paper, we evaluated the robustness of our results to alternative forms of clustering (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff
2011b, Appendix Table 7). We found that school-cohort clustering yields more conservative confidence intervals than more computationally
intensive techniques such as two-way clustering by student and classroom (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2011).
   25 In this and all subsequent scatter plots, we first demean the x and y variables within subject by school level groups to isolate variation within
these cells, as in the regressions.


                                                                         15
                             IV.     Estimating Bias Using Observable Characteristics

  We defined forecast bias in Section I.C under the assumption that students were randomly assigned to
teachers in the forecast year t.        In this section, we develop a method of estimating forecast bias using
observational data, i.e., when the school follows the same (non-random) assignment rule for teachers and
students in the forecast period t as in previous periods. We first derive an estimator for forecast bias based
on selection on observable characteristics and then implement it using data on parent characteristics and
lagged test score gains.

                                                          A.   Methodology

  In this subsection, we show that forecast bias can be estimated by regressing predicted test scores based
on observable characteristics excluded from the VA model (such as parent income) on VA estimates. To
begin, observe that regressing test score residuals Ait on b jt in observational data yields a coefficient of 1
because b jt is the best linear predictor of Ait :

                           Cov Ait ; b jt                Cov      jt ; b jt   C Cov "it ; b jt
                                                   D                                             D 1.
                              V ar b jt                                V ar b jt

It follows from the definition of forecast bias that in observational data,

                                                                  Cov "it ; b jt
(12)                                              B b jt D                          .
                                                                    V ar b jt

Intuitively, the degree of forecast bias can be quantified by the extent to which students are sorted to teachers
based on unobserved determinants of achievement "it .
  Although we cannot observe "it , we can obtain information on components of "it using variables that
predict test score residuals Ait but were omitted from the VA model, such as parent income. Let Pit denote
a vector of such characteristics and Pit denote the residuals obtained after regressing the elements of Pit on
the baseline controls Xit in a specification with teacher fixed effects, as in (5). Decompose the error in score
residuals "it D Pit C "it0 into the component that projects onto Pit and the remaining (unobservable) error
"it0 . To estimate forecast bias using P, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 2 [Selection on Excluded Observables] Students are sorted to teachers purely on excluded
observables P:
                                                         E "it0 j j D E "it0
                                   Cov . Pit ;b jt /
Under this assumption, B D           V ar .b jt /
                                                     .    As in (5), we estimate the coefficient vector   using an OLS
regression of Ait on Pit with teacher fixed effects:

(13)                                                      Ait D    j   C Pit .

                                                                  16

                                                                    Cov Ait ; b jt

                                                                       V ar b jt

an OLS regression of predicted scores Ait on VA estimates under Assumption 2.

                                                       B.    Estimates of Forecast Bias


   We estimate forecast bias using two variables that are excluded from standard VA models: parent charac-
teristics and lagged test score gains.
   Parent Characteristics. We define a vector of parent characteristics Pit that consists of the following
variables: mother’s age at child’s birth, indicators for parent’s 401(k) contributions and home ownership,
and an indicator for the parent marital status interacted with a quartic in parent household income.26 We
construct residual parent characteristics Pit by regressing each element of Pit on the baseline control vector
Xit and teacher fixed effects, as in (5). We then regress Ait on Pit , again including teacher fixed effects, and
                                       p
calculate predicted values Ait D bPit . We fit separate models for each subject and school level (elementary
                                                                                                                      p

   In Column 2 of Table 3, we regress Ait on b jt , including subject-by-school-level fixed effects as above.
The coefficient in this regression is B p D 0:002, i.e. the degree of forecast bias due to selection on parent
characteristics is 0.2%. The upper bound on the 95% confidence interval for B p is 0.25%. Figure 2b

presents a non-parametric analog of this linear regression. It plots Ait vs. teacher VA b jt using a binned
scatter on the same scale as in Figure 2a. The relationship between predicted scores and teacher VA is
nearly flat throughout the distribution.
   Another intuitive way to assess the degree of selection on parent characteristics – which corresponds to
familiar methods of assessing omitted variable bias – is to control for Pit when estimating the impact of b jt
on test scores, as in Kane and Staiger (2008, Table 6). To implement this approach using within-teacher
variation to construct residuals, we first regress raw test scores Ait on the baseline control vector used in
the VA model Xit , parent characteristics Pit , and teacher fixed effects, as in (5). Again, we fit a separate
model for each subject and school level (elementary and middle). We then regress the residuals from this
regression (adding back the teacher fixed effects) on b jt , including subject-by-school-level fixed effects as
in Column 1. Column 3 of Table 3 shows that the coefficient on VA falls to 0.996 after controlling for parent
characteristics. The difference between the point estimates in Columns 1 and 3 is 0.002. This difference

   26 We code the parent characteristics as 0 for the 12.3% of students whom we are unable to match to a parent either because we could not match
the student to the tax data (10.1%) or because we could not find a parent for a matched student (2.2%). We include indicators for missing parent
data in both cases. We also code mother’s age at child’s birth as 0 for observations where we match parents but do not have valid data on the parent’s
age, and include an indicator for such cases.


                                                                         17
                                                                        p
coincides exactly with our estimate of B p in Column 2 because Ait is simply the difference between test
score residuals with and without controlling for parent characteristics.

  The magnitude of forecast bias due to selection on parent characteristics is very small for two reasons.
First, a large fraction of the variation in test scores that project onto parent characteristics is captured by
lagged test scores and other controls in the school district data. The standard deviation of class-average
predicted score residuals based on parent characteristics is 0:014. Intuitively, students from high income
families have higher test scores not just in the current grade but in previous grades as well, and thus previous
scores capture a large portion of the variation in family income.           However, because lagged test scores
are noisy measures of latent ability, parent characteristics still have significant predictive power for test
scores even conditional on Xit . The F-statistic on the parent characteristics in the regression of test score
residuals Ait on Pit is 84, when run at the classroom level (which is the variation relevant for detecting
class-level sorting to teachers). This leads to the second reason that forecast bias is so small: the remaining
variation in parent characteristics after conditioning on Xit is essentially unrelated to teacher VA. The
                        p
correlation between Ait and b jt is 0:014. If this correlation were 1 instead, the bias due to sorting on parent
characteristics would be B p D 0:149. This shows that there is substantial scope to detect sorting of students
to teachers based on parent characteristics even conditional on the school district controls. In practice, such
sorting turns out to be quite small in magnitude, leading to minimal forecast bias.

  Prior Test Scores. Another natural set of variables to evaluate bias is prior test scores (Rothstein 2010).
Value-added models typically control for Ai;t 1 , but one can evaluate sorting on Ai;t       2   (or, equivalently,
on lagged gains, Ai;t   1   Ai;t 2 ). The question here is effectively whether controlling for additional lags
substantially affects VA estimates once one controls for Ai;t 1 . For this analysis, we restrict attention to
the subsample of students with data on both lagged and twice-lagged scores, essentially dropping 4th grade
from our sample. We re-estimate VA b jt on this sample to obtain VA estimates on exactly the sample used
to evaluate bias.

  We assess forecast bias due to sorting on lagged score gains using the same approach as with parent
characteristics. Column 4 of Table 3 replicates Column 2, using predicted score residuals based on Ai;t 2 ,
which we denote by Alit , as the dependent variable. The coefficient on b jt is 0.022, with a standard error
of 0.002. The upper bound on the 95% confidence interval for forecast bias due to twice lagged scores is
0.026. Figure 2c plots predicted scores based on twice-lagged scores (Alit ) against teacher VA, following
the same methodology used to construct Figure 2b. Consistent with the regression estimates, there is a
slight upward-sloping relationship between VA and Alit that is small relative to the relationship between VA
and test score residuals in year t.

  Forecast bias due to omitting Ai;t   2   is small for the same two reasons as with parent characteristics. The

                                                        18
baseline control vector Xit captures much of the variation in Ai;t 2 : the variation in class-average predicted
score residuals based on Ai;t   2   is 0:048. The remaining variation in Ai;t    2   is not strongly related to teacher
VA: the correlation between Ai;t     2   and b jt is 0:037. If this correlation were 1, forecast bias would be 0:601,
again implying that sorting on lagged gains is quite minimal relative to what it could be.
  We conclude that selection on two important predictors of test scores excluded from standard VA models
– parent characteristics and lagged test score gains – generates negligible forecast bias in our baseline VA
estimates.

                                               C.   Unconditional Sorting


  To obtain further insight into the sorting process, we analyze unconditional correlations (without con-
trolling for school-district observables Xit ) between teacher VA and excluded observables such as parent
income in Appendix D. We find that sorting of students to teachers based on parent characteristics does not
generate significant forecast bias in VA estimates for two reasons.
  First, although higher socio-economic status children have higher VA teachers on average, the magnitude
of such sorting is quite small. For example, a $10,000 (0.3 SD) increase in parent income raises teacher
VA by 0.00084 (Appendix Table 2). One explanation for why even unconditional sorting of students to
teacher VA based on family background is small is that 85% of the variation in teacher VA is within rather
than between schools. The fact that parents sort primarily by choosing schools rather than teachers within
schools limits the scope for sorting on unobservables.
  Second, and more importantly, controlling for a student’s lagged test score entirely eliminates the cor-
relation between teacher VA and parent income. This shows that the unconditional relationship between
parent income and teacher VA runs through lagged test scores and explains why VA estimates that control
for lagged scores are unbiased despite sorting on parent income.
  An auxiliary implication of these results is that differences in teacher quality are responsible for only a
small share of the gap in achievement by family income. In the cross-section, a $10,000 increase in parental
income is associated with a 0.065 SD increase in 8th grade test scores (on average across math and English).
Based on estimates of the persistence of teachers’ impacts and the correlation between teacher VA and
parent income, we estimate that only 4% of the cross-sectional correlation between test scores and parent
income in 8th grade can be attributed to differences in teacher VA from grades K-8 (see Appendix D). This
finding is consistent with evidence on the emergence of achievement gaps at very young ages (Fryer and
Levitt 2004, Heckman et al. 2006), which also suggests that existing achievement gaps are largely driven by
factors other than teacher quality. However, it is important to note that good teachers in primary school can
close a significant portion of the achievement gap created by these other factors. If teacher quality for low
income students were improved by 0.1 SD in all grades from K-8, 8th grade scores would rise by 0.34 SD,

                                                           19
enough to offset more than a $50,000 difference in family income.

                              V.    Estimating Bias Using Teacher Switching Quasi-Experiments


    The evidence in Section IV does not rule out the possibility that students are sorted to teachers based
on unobservable characteristics orthogonal to parent characteristics and lagged score gains.                                          The ideal
method to assess bias due to unobservables would be to estimate the relationship between test scores and VA
estimates (from pre-existing observational data) in an experiment where students are randomly assigned to
teachers. In this section, we develop a quasi-experimental analog to this experiment that exploits naturally
occurring teacher turnover to estimate forecast bias. Our approach yields more precise estimates of the
degree of bias than experimental studies (Kane and Staiger 2008, Kane et al. 2013) at the cost of stronger
identification assumptions, which we describe and evaluate in detail below.

                                                               A.   Methodology


    Adjacent cohorts of students within a school are frequently exposed to different teachers. In our core
sample, 30.1% of teachers switch to a different grade within the same school the following year, 6.1% of
teachers switch to a different school within the same district, and another 5.8% switch out of the district
entirely.27
    To understand how we use such turnover to estimate forecast bias, consider a school with three 4th grade
classrooms. Suppose one of the teachers leaves the school in 1995 and is replaced by a teacher whose
VA estimate in math is 0:3 higher. Assume that the distribution of unobserved determinants of scores "it
does not change between 1994 and 1995. If forecast bias B D 0, this change in teaching staff should
raise average 4th grade math scores in the school by 0:3=3 D 0:1. More generally, we can estimate B by
comparing the change in mean scores across cohorts to the change in mean VA driven by teacher turnover
provided that student quality is stable over time.
                                                1g
    To formalize this idea, let b jtft;t             denote the VA estimate for teacher j in year t constructed as in Section
                                                                                                1g
III using data from all years except t                  1 and t. Similarly, let b j;tft;t1           denote the VA estimate for teacher
j in year t         1 based on data from all years except t                   1 and t.28 Let Q sgt denote the (student-weighted)
                      1g
mean of b jtft;t           across teachers in school s in grade g. We define the change in mean teacher value-added
from year t         1 to year t in grade g in school s as 1Q sgt D Q sgt                    Q sg;t 1 . By leaving out both years t and
t     1 when estimating VA, we ensure that the variation in 1Q sgt is driven by changes in the teaching staff
rather than changes in VA estimates.29 Leaving out two years eliminates the correlation between changes

    27 Although teachers switch grades frequently, only 4.5% of students have the same teacher for two consecutive years.
   28 As above, we estimate VA separately for each subject (math and English) and school-level (elementary and middle), and hence only identify
forecast bias from teacher switches within subject by school-level cells.
   29 Part of the variation in 1 N
                                   sgt comes from drift. Even for a given teacher, predicted VA will change because our forecast of VA varies across


                                                                        20
in mean test scores across cohorts t and t                     1 and estimation error in 1Q sgt .30
    Let Asgt denote the mean value of Ait for students in school s in grade g in year t and define the change
in mean residual scores as 1Asgt D Asgt                       Asg;t 1 . We estimate the degree of forecast bias B by regressing
changes in mean test scores across cohorts on changes in mean teacher VA:

(15)                                                  1Asgt D a C b1Q sgt C 1                   sgt


The coefficient b in (15) identifies the degree of forecast bias as defined in (10) under the following identi-
fication assumption.

Assumption 3 [Teacher Switching as a Quasi-Experiment] Changes in teacher VA across cohorts within
a school-grade are orthogonal to changes in other determinants of student scores:

(16)                                                      Cov 1Q sgt ; 1           sgt   D 0.

Under Assumption 3, the regression coefficient in (15) measures the degree of forecast bias: b D                                                        D
1      B.b jtft;t 1g /.    We present a simple derivation of this result in Appendix E. Intuitively, (15) is a quasi-
experimental analog of the regression in (10) used to define forecast bias, differencing and averaging across
cohorts. Importantly, because we analyze student outcomes at the school-grade-cohort level in (15), we do
not exploit information on classroom assignment, thus overcoming the non-random assignment of students
to classrooms within each school-grade-cohort.
    Assumption 3 could potentially be violated by endogenous student or teacher sorting to schools over
time. Student sorting at an annual frequency is minimal because of the costs of changing schools. During
the period we study, most students would have to move to a different neighborhood to switch schools, which
families would be unlikely to do simply because a single teacher leaves or enters a given grade. While
endogenous teacher sorting is plausible over long horizons, the high-frequency changes we analyze are
likely driven by idiosyncratic shocks such as changes in staffing needs, maternity leaves, or the relocation
of spouses. Hence, we believe that (16) is a plausible assumption and we present evidence supporting its
validity below.
    The estimate of           obtained from (15) is analogous to a local average treatment effect (LATE) because
it applies to the teacher switches that occur in our data rather than all potential teacher switches in the
population. For example, if teachers of honors math classes never teach regular math classes, we would be
unable to determine if VA estimates for honors teachers are biased relative to those of regular teachers. This

years. Because the degree of drift is small across a single year, drift accounts for 5.5% of the variance in 1 N sgt . As a result, isolating the variation
due purely to teacher switching using an instrumental variables specification yields very similar results (not reported).
  30 Formally, not using a two-year leave out would immediately violate Assumption 3 below, because unobserved determinants of scores ("
                                                                                                                                                        sgt
and " sg;t 1 ) would appear directly in 1Q sgt .


                                                                           21
is unlikely to be a serious limitation in practice because we observe a wide variety of staff changes in the
district we study (including switches from honors to regular classes), as is typical in large school districts
(Cook and Mansfield 2013). Moreover, as long as the policies under consideration induce changes similar
to those that occur already – for example, policies do not switch teachers from one type of course to another
if such changes have never occurred in the past – this limitation does not affect the policy relevance of our
estimates.
   If observable characteristics Xit are also orthogonal to changes in teacher quality across cohorts (i.e.,
satisfy Assumption 3), we can implement (15) simply by regressing the change in raw test scores 1Asgt on
1Q sgt . We therefore begin by analyzing changes in raw test scores 1Asgt across cohorts and then confirm
that changes in control variables across cohorts are uncorrelated with 1Q sgt . Because we do not need
controls, in this section we use the core sample of 10.7 million observations described in Section II.C rather
than the subset of 7.6 million observations that have lagged scores and the other controls needed to estimate
the VA model.
   Our research design is related to recent work analyzing the impacts of teacher turnover on student achieve-
ment, but is the first to use turnover to validate VA models. Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) identify
the variance of teacher effects from differences in variances of test score gains across schools with low vs.
high teacher turnover. We directly identify the causal impacts of teachers from first moments – the rela-
tionship between changes in mean scores across cohorts and mean teacher value-added – rather than second
moments. Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) analyze whether the VA of teachers who enter or exit affects the
test scores of other teachers’ students in their school-grade cell, but do not compare changes in mean test
scores by cohort to the predictions of VA models.31

                                                                B.    Event Studies

   To illustrate our research design, we begin with event studies of test scores around the entry and exit of
high and low VA teachers (Figure 3). Let year 0 denote the school year that a teacher enters or exits a
school-grade-subject cell and define all other school years relative to that year (e.g., if the teacher enters in
1995, year 1992 is -3 and year 1997 is +2). We define an entry event as the arrival of a teacher who did not
teach in that school-grade-subject cell for the three preceding years; analogously, we define an exit event
as the departure of a teacher who does not return to the same school-grade-subject cell for at least three
years. To obtain a balanced sample, we analyze events for which we have data on average test scores at the
school-grade-subject level for at least three years before and after the event.32
   31 The peer effects documented by Jackson and Bruegmann could affect our estimates of forecast bias using the switcher design. However, peer
learning effects are likely to be smaller with teacher exits than entry, provided that knowledge does not deteriorate very rapidly. We find that teacher
entry and exit yield broadly similar results, suggesting that spillovers across teachers are not a first-order source of bias for our technique.
   32 In school-grade-subject cells with multiple events (e.g. entries in both 1995 and 1999), we include all such events by stacking the data and
using the three years before and after each event.


                                                                          22
   We define a teacher as “high VA” if her estimated VA in her year of entry or exit is in the top 5% of the
distribution of all entrants or leavers in her subject. We define “low VA” teachers analogously as those who
have estimated VA in the bottom 5% of the distribution of those who enter or exit in their subjects.33 We
estimate VA for each teacher in the year of entry or exit using data outside the six-year window used for
the event studies.34 Because VA is measured with error, some teachers who are classified as “high VA” are
those who had very good students by chance. Thus, if we were to define a “high VA” teacher as one whose
students scored highly within the event window, we would spuriously find a relationship between test scores
and the entry of such a teacher even if she had no causal impact on student performance.
   Figure 3a plots the impact of the entry of a high-VA teacher on mean test scores. The solid series plots
school-grade-subject-year means of test scores in the three years before and after a high-VA teacher enters
the school-grade-subject cell. The dashed line in Figure 3a plots test scores in the previous school year (i.e.,
the previous grade) for the same cohorts of students. To eliminate any secular trends, we remove year effects
by regressing mean test scores on year dummies and plotting the residuals. We normalize both current and
previous scores to 0 in the first year of the event study to facilitate interpretation of the scale. We do not
condition on any other covariates in this figure: each point simply shows average test scores for different
cohorts of students within a school-grade-subject cell adjusted for year effects.
   When a high-VA teacher arrives, end-of-year test scores in the subject and grade taught by that teacher
rise immediately. But test scores in the prior grade remain stable, as one would expect: the entry of a
high-VA teacher in grade 5 should have no impact on the same cohort’s 4th grade test scores. The stability
of prior test scores supports the identification assumption in (16) that school quality and student attributes
are not changing sharply around the entry of a high-VA teacher. We also find that class size does not change
significantly around the entry and exit events we study.
   The mean test score in the grade in which the high VA teacher enters rises by 0.042 SD from year -1 to
0, while the mean lagged test score changes by 0.008. Hence, the entry of a high VA teacher increases
mean test score gains by 0.035. The null hypothesis that this change is 0 is rejected with p < 0:001, with
standard errors clustered by school-cohort as above. More importantly, the magnitude of the increase in
mean test score gains is very similar to the change in mean teacher VA in the school-grade-subject cell,
which is 0.042.35 The hypothesis that the observed impact on mean score gains equals the increase in mean
VA is not rejected ( p D 0:34), consistent with the hypothesis that the VA estimates are forecast unbiased.

  33 In cases where multiple teachers enter or exit at the same time, we use the teachers’ mean VA to decide whether the event falls in the top or
bottom 5% of the relevant VA distribution.
  34 More precisely, we estimate VA for each teacher in each year excluding a five year window (two years prior, the current year, and two years
post). Coupled with our definitions of entry and exit – which require that the teacher not be present in the school-grade-subject cell for 3 years
before or after the event – this ensures that we do not use any data from the relevant cell between event years -3 and +2 to compute teacher VA.
  35 When computing this change in mean VA, we weight teachers by the number of students they teach. For teachers who do not have any VA
measures from classrooms outside the leave-out window, we impute VA as 0 (the sample mean). We discuss the robustness of our results to this
imputation below.


                                                                       23
  The remaining panels of Figure 3 repeat the event study in Panel A for other types of arrivals and depar-
tures. Figure 3b examines current and lagged test scores around the departure of a high-VA teacher. In
this figure, we normalize both current and lagged mean scores to 0 in the final year of the event study to
facilitate interpretation. There is a smooth negative trend in both current and lagged scores, suggesting that
high-VA teachers leave schools with declining scores. However, scores in the grade taught by the teacher
who leaves drop sharply relative to prior scores in the event year, showing that the departure of the high VA
teacher lowers the achievement of subsequent cohorts of students. Figures 3c and 3d analyze the arrival
and departure of low VA teachers. Test scores in the grade taught by the teacher fall relative to prior scores
when low VA teachers enter a school-grade cell and rise when low VA teachers leave.
  In every case, the change in test score gains is significantly different from 0 with p < 0:01 but is not
significantly different from what one would forecast based on the change in mean teacher VA. Together,
these event studies provide direct evidence that deselecting low VA teachers and retaining high-VA teachers
improves the academic achievement of students.

                                         C.   Estimates of Forecast Bias


  The event studies focus on the tails of the teacher VA distribution and thus exploit only a small fraction of
the variation arising from teacher turnover in the data. We now exploit all the variation in teacher VA across
cohorts due to teaching staff changes to obtain a broader and more precise estimate of forecast bias. To do
                                                                      1g
so, we first construct a leave-two-year-out estimate of VA b jtft;t        for each teacher using data for all years
except t   1 and t. We then calculate the change in mean teacher VA for each school-grade-subject-year
cell 1Q sgt as described in Section V.A.
  Figure 4a presents a binned scatter plot of the changes in mean raw test scores across cohorts 1Asgt
against changes in mean teacher value-added 1Q sgt , weighting by the number of students in each cell. We
include year fixed effects so that the estimate is identified purely from differential changes in teacher VA
across school-grade-subject cells over time and restrict the sample to classrooms with non-missing teacher
VA estimates. Changes in the quality of the teaching staff strongly predict changes in test scores across
cohorts in a school-grade-subject cell. The estimated coefficient on 1Q sgt is 0.974, with a standard error
of 0.033 (Table 4, Column 1). The implied forecast bias of 2.6% is not statistically distinguishable from 0
and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is 9.1%.
  The conclusion that VA measures exhibit little or no forecast bias rests on the validity of the identification
assumption in (16). One natural concern is that improvements in teacher quality may be correlated with
other improvements in a school that also increase test scores and thus lead us to underestimate forecast bias.
To address this concern, Column 2 of Table 4 replicates the baseline specification in Column 1 including
school by year fixed effects instead of just year effects. In this specification, the only source of identifying

                                                       24
variation comes from differential changes in teacher quality across subjects and grades within a school in a
given year. The coefficient on 1Q sgt remains virtually unchanged.
   Column 3 further accounts for secular trends in subject- or grade-specific quality by controlling for the
change in mean teacher VA in the prior and subsequent year as well as cubics in the change in prior-year
mean own-subject and other-subject scores across cohorts. Including these additional controls for trends
has little impact on our estimate of forecast bias.

                                                                 D.    Placebo Tests


   We further evaluate (16) using a series of placebo tests. Column 4 of Table 4 replicates the specification
in Column 2, replacing the change in actual scores with the change in predicted scores based on parent
characteristics.         We predict scores using an OLS regression of Ait on the five parent characteristics Pit
used in Section IV, with no other control variables. The estimated effect on predicted test scores is not
significantly different from 0, and the upper bound on the 95% confidence interval is 0:013. Figure 4b
presents a binned scatter plot corresponding to this regression. There is little relationship between changes
in mean teacher VA and mean predicted scores throughout the distribution, supporting the assumption that
changes in the quality of the teaching staff are uncorrelated with changes in student characteristics.
   Next, we use contemporaneous test scores in the other subject (math or English) to evaluate changes in
student quality. In this placebo test, it is important to distinguish between elementary and middle schools.
In middle school, students have different teachers for math and English. Therefore, if (16) holds, we would
expect changes in mean math teacher VA to have little impact on English test scores, holding fixed the
quality of English teachers.36 We test this hypothesis in Column 5 of Table 4 by regressing changes in mean
scores on 1Q sgt in both the same subject and the other subject. The estimated effect on test scores in the
other subject is 0.038 and is not statistically distinguishable from 0 ( p D 0:64).
   Figure 5a presents a non-parametric analog of this regression by plotting changes in mean test scores
across cohorts vs. changes in mean teacher VA in the other subject. To partial out the effect of changes
in mean teacher VA in the same subject, we regress both the x and y variables on changes in mean teacher
VA in the own subject and compute residuals. We then bin the x-axis residuals into 20 equal-sized groups
(vingtiles) and plot the mean of the x and y residuals within each bin.                                       Consistent with the regression
estimate, there is no relationship between changes in teacher VA and scores in the other subject throughout
the distribution. We view this result as strong evidence supporting (16), as it is unlikely that changes in
student unobservables "sgt would have no impact on scores in the other subject.
   In elementary school, students have one teacher for both math and English. Because elementary school

  36 If math teacher quality directly affects English scores (or vice versa), one will obtain a positive coefficient in this regression even if (16) holds.
Hence, this test is a sufficient but not necessary condition for (16).


                                                                           25
teachers’ math and English VA are highly correlated (                         D 0:6) and because VA is measured with error,
changes in teacher VA in one subject have signal content for teaching quality in the other subject. Therefore,
in elementary school, we should expect mean teacher VA to have non-zero effects on scores in the other
subject. Figure 5b replicates Figure 5a for elementary school and shows that this is indeed the case. A 1
unit improvement in mean teacher VA raises scores in the other subject by 0.237 (Column 6 of Table 4).
   Together, these tests imply that any violation of (16) would have to be driven by unobserved determinants
of test scores "sgt that (1) are uncorrelated with parent characteristics, (2) are unrelated to prior test scores
and contemporaneous test scores in the other subject, and (3) change differentially across grades within
schools at an annual frequency. We believe that such sorting on unobservables is implausible given the
information available to teachers and students and the constraints they face in switching across schools at
high frequencies.

                                                  E.    Additional Robustness Checks

   In Table 5, we further assess the robustness of our estimates to alternative specifications and sample
selection criteria. Our preceding specifications pool all sources of variation in teacher quality, including
switches across grades within a school as well as entry into and exit from schools. In Column 1 of Table
5, we isolate the variation in teacher quality due to departures from schools, which are perhaps least likely
to be correlated with high-frequency fluctuations in student quality across cohorts. We instrument for the
change in mean teacher VA 1Q sgt with the fraction of students in the prior cohort taught by teachers who
leave the school, multiplied by the mean VA among school-leavers (with the instrument defined as 0 for
cells with no school-leavers).37 We include year fixed effects in this specification, as in Column 1 of Table
4. This specification yields a coefficient on 1Q sgt of 1.045, similar to our baseline estimate of 0.974.
   The preceding estimates all use the subsample of students for whom we have estimates of teacher VA.
While this corresponds directly to the sample used to estimate VA, restricting the sample to classrooms
with non-missing VA estimates could lead to violations of the identification assumption in (16) because
we do not use the entire school-grade-subject cohort for identification.38                             To evaluate how missing data
on teacher VA affects our results, in Column 2 of Table 5, we replicate the baseline specification (Column
1 of Table 4) using all students in the core sample. We impute teacher VA as the sample mean (0) for
the 16% of observations for whom we have no leave-two-year-out VA estimate, either because we have no
teacher information or because the teacher taught for only those two years in the district. The coefficient on
  37 For example, if the previous cohort had four equally sized classrooms, with one taught by a school-leaver with b ft;t 1g D 0:2, the value of
                                                                                                                     jt
our instrument would be 0:25 0:2 D 0:05. This is the expected loss in mean VA across cohorts due to school-leavers. The first stage coefficient
on this variable is -0.97 (t-statistic D 53).
   38 To take an extreme example, suppose teacher information is reported for only one of 5 classrooms in a given school-grade-subject cell. In
this case, comparisons of mean scores across students in two cohorts with non-missing teacher information is equivalent to comparing mean scores
across a single classroom in two different years. This could violate the identifying assumption of our quasi-experimental design if assignment to
classrooms is non-random.


                                                                      26
1Q sgt with this imputation procedure in the full sample is 0.877. The estimate falls because the imputation
of teacher VA generates measurement error in average teaching quality, leading to attenuation bias. For
example, if a highly effective teacher enters the district for only a single year, so that we are not able to
calculate VA from other years of data, our imputation procedure will treat this teacher as being average,
leading to measurement error in mean VA in the school-grade-subject cell.39
   To assess whether measurement error due to imputation is responsible for the smaller coefficient, we
restrict the sample to school-grade-subject-year cells in which the fraction of observations with imputed
teacher VA estimates is less than 25% in both the current and preceding year. Unlike the sample restrictions
imposed in Table 4, restrictions at the school-grade-subject level cannot generate violations of (16) due to
selection bias because we exclude entire cohorts rather than individual classrooms. In this subsample, the
fraction of observations with non-missing teacher VA information is 94%. Accordingly, the coefficient on
1Q sgt rises to 0.952, as shown in Column 3 of Table 5. In Column 4, we further restrict the sample to
school-grade-subject-year cells with no missing teacher VA observations in the current and preceding year.
In this sample, we obtain an estimate on 1Q sgt of 0.990, implying forecast bias of 1.0%. Hence, missing
data on teacher VA does not appear to affect our conclusions significantly.

                                             VI.    Comparing Bias Across VA Models


   Our analysis thus far has evaluated bias in a value-added specification that includes a very rich set of
controls. Which of these controls are most important in obtaining unbiased estimates of VA? To answer
this question, we report estimates of bias for various VA models in Table 6. Each row of the table considers
a different VA specification. Column 1 reports correlations between the VA estimates obtained from each
model and the baseline estimates. Column 2 reports estimates of forecast bias using our preferred quasi-
experimental specification (Column 1 of Table 4).
   The first row of the table replicates our baseline VA model as a reference. For comparability, we estimate
all the remaining models on the sample used in this row.
   In row 2, we follow the traditional approach used in prior work of constructing student test-score residuals
by regressing raw scores Ait on controls Xit in a specification without teacher fixed-effects, unlike in (5).
As discussed in Section I.B, this method exploits variation both within and across teachers to identify the
coefficients on the control vector and thus can understate teacher effects by over-attributing test score growth
to covariates if there is sorting. In practice, this turns out to be a minor concern: VA estimates constructed
from test score residuals that are identified using the traditional approach have a correlation of 0.979 with
our baseline VA estimates. Correspondingly, they exhibit forecast bias of 2.2%, very similar to our baseline

 39 We measure 1Q
                        sgt with error because we code VA as 0 for teachers with missing VA before we define 1Q sgt . If we were to instead set
1Q sgt to 0 in all cells where VA is missing for any teacher, we would mechanically obtain the same coefficient as in Column 1 of Table 4.


                                                                     27
model. This is because unconditional sorting is relatively minimal in practice, as shown in Section IV.C,
and thus most of the variation in the controls Xit is within rather than between teachers.
  In row 3, we replicate our baseline specification adding indicators for teacher experience to the control
vector Xit . We include indicators for years of experience from 0 to 5, with the omitted group being teachers
with 6 or more years of experience. The resulting VA estimates have a correlation of 0.989 with our baseline
estimates because teacher experience has small effects on student achievement (Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger
2008).
  The remaining rows of the table strip out elements of the baseline control vector to determine which
controls matter most for forecast bias. In row 4, we include only year fixed effects and the controls based
on prior-year test scores: cubic polynomials in student, classroom, and school-grade math and English
scores interacted with grade level. These VA estimates remain highly correlated with the baseline estimates
and continue to exhibit small and statistically insignificant forecast bias of 3.8%.
  In row 5, we further reduce the controls to include only the cubics in student-level prior math and English
test scores (without grade interactions) along with grade and year fixed effects.      Forecast bias is 4.8%,
somewhat higher than with our much richer baseline control vector.          Nevertheless, even with this very
parsimonious control vector, we do not reject the hypothesis that VA estimates are forecast unbiased. In
row 6, we replicate row 5, dropping the controls for test scores in the other subject. Forecast bias rises to
10.2% in this specification, showing that prior test scores in the other subject are useful in accounting for
sorting.
  In row 7, we control for all variables in the baseline model except those based on prior test scores. Here,
the degree of forecast bias jumps to 45.4%. Finally, row 8 estimates VA without any controls except year
and grade fixed effects, i.e., using raw mean test scores by teacher. These VA estimates are very poorly
correlated with the other VA measures and are biased by nearly 66%.
  The lesson of this analysis is that controlling for prior student-level test scores is the key to obtaining
unbiased VA estimates. One potential explanation for this result is that classroom assignments in large
schools are made primarily on the basis of prior-year test performance and its correlates.

                                      VII.   Relationship to Prior Work


  Prior research on bias in value-added models has reached conflicting conclusions (e.g., Kane and Staiger
2008, Rothstein 2010, Koedel and Betts 2011, Kinsler 2012, Goldhaber and Chaplin 2012, Kane et al.
2013). Our findings help reconcile these results and show that there is actually consensus in the literature
on the central empirical issues.
  Rothstein (2009, 2010) initiated the recent body of research on bias in VA models by reporting two results.
First, there is significant grouping of students into classrooms based on twice-lagged scores (lagged gains),

                                                      28
even conditional on once-lagged scores (Rothstein 2010, Table 4). Second, this grouping on lagged gains
generates minimal bias in VA estimates: controlling for twice-lagged scores does not have a significant
effect on VA estimates (Rothstein 2010, Table 6).40 We replicate these results in our data (see Table 3),
as do Kane and Staiger (2008, Table 6). Therefore, the literature is in agreement that VA measures do not
suffer from substantial bias due to selection on lagged score gains.
   Rothstein (2010) emphasizes that his findings raise concerns about the potential for bias due to selection
on unobservable student characteristics.41 To address this concern, Kane and Staiger (2008) and Kane et
al. (2013) report estimates of bias from experiments in which students were randomly assigned to teachers.
Their point estimates suggest that selection on unobservables is small, but their 95% confidence intervals
are consistent with a large amount of bias – up to 50% in some cases – because of constraints on sample
size and compliance. Our quasi-experimental estimates show that the degree of bias due to selection on
unobservables turns out to be negligible with much greater precision in a more representative sample. The
recent replication of our quasi-experimental methodology by Kane, Staiger, and Bacher-Hicks (2014) in the
Los Angeles Unified School District also reaches the same conclusion. Hence, studies that have directly
tested for selection on unobservables are in agreement that VA estimates are not significantly biased by such
selection.
   In future research, it may be interesting to explore why the grouping of students on lagged test score
gains originally documented by Rothstein (2010) does not ultimately lead to significant forecast bias in
VA estimates. However, the findings in this paper and the related literature are sufficient to conclude that
standard estimates of teacher VA provide unbiased forecasts of teachers’ impacts on students’ test scores.

                                                             VIII.     Conclusion


   The main lesson of this study is that value-added models that control for a student’s prior-year test scores
provide unbiased forecasts of teachers’ causal impacts on student achievement. Because the dispersion in
teacher effects is substantial, this result implies that improvements in teacher quality can raise students’ test
scores significantly.
   Although our analysis shows that test-score based VA measures are useful predictors of teacher quality,
one can potentially improve such predictions in at least two dimensions. First, incorporating other measures
of teacher quality – such as principal evaluations or information on teacher characteristics – may yield more

   40 An interesting question is how Rothstein’s two findings are consistent with each other. There are two explanations for this pattern. First, the
degree of grouping that Rothstein finds on Ai;t 2 has small effects on residual test score gains because the correlation between Ai;t 2 and Ait
conditional on Ai;t 1 is relatively small. Second, if the component of Ai;t 2 on which there is grouping is not the same as the component that
is correlated with Ai;t , VA estimates may be completely unaffected by grouping on Ai;t 2 . For both reasons, one cannot infer from grouping on
Ai;t 2 that VA estimates are significantly biased by selection on Ai;t 2 . See Goldhaber and Chaplin (2012) for further discussion of these and
related issues.
   41 In personal correspondence, Rothstein notes that his findings are “neither necessary nor sufficient for there to be bias in a VA estimate” and
that “if the selection is just on observables, the bias is too small to matter. The worrying scenario is selection on unobservables.”


                                                                        29
precise forecasts of teachers’ impacts on test scores. One could use the quasi-experimental methodology
developed here to validate such measures of teacher quality. For example, when a teacher with good evalua-
tions switches into a school, do outcomes improve? Second, it would be valuable to develop richer measures
of teacher quality that go beyond the mean test score impacts that we analyzed here. One could develop VA
measures at various percentiles of the test score distribution and for specific demographic subgroups. For
instance, are some teachers better with boys rather than girls or high achievers rather than low achievers?

  In this paper, we established that value-added measures can help us identify which teachers have the
greatest ability to raise students’ test scores. One cannot conclude from this result that teacher VA is a good
measure of teacher “quality,” however, as test scores are not the ultimate outcome of interest. Do high VA
teachers also improve students’ long-term outcomes, or are they simply better at teaching to the test? We
turn to this question in the next paper in this volume.

Online Appendix A: Value-Added Estimation Methods


  In this appendix, we provide a step-by-step guide to implementing our method of estimating VA in the
presence of drift. In practice, we cannot follow exactly the method described in Section I.B because data
availability varies across teachers.    For instance, there are different numbers of students per class and
teachers have a different number of past and future classes from which to construct value-added in any
given year.    We calculate value-added in three steps, separately for each subject (math and English) and
school level (elementary and middle).
  Step 1 [Residualization of Test Scores]: We begin by residualizing student scores Ait with respect to
controls Xit by running an OLS regression with teacher fixed effects of the form

                                                Ait D    j    C Xit

and constructing residuals
                                               Ait D Ait          bXit :



  Step 2 [Estimation of Variance Components]: Next, we estimate the individual-level variance of residual
               2
test scores,   "   D V ar ."it /, as

                                                                  N           1
                                       O 2" D M S E
                                                         N        K           C C1
where M S E is the variance of the within-classroom deviations of Ait , N is the total number of students, C
is the total number of classrooms, and K is the number of control variables in the X it control vector. The
scaling term is required to correct the degrees of freedom for the fact that we have already estimated K
parameters to form the residual Ait . We also estimate V ar .Ait /, the total variance of Ait , again accounting
for the prior estimation of b when calculating the degrees of freedom correction.
  At this point, we collapse the data to the classroom-level by constructing the average residualized score
AN ct for each classroom c and proceed to use class-level means for the remaining steps. In middle school,
teachers teach more than one class per year. We handle such cases by collapsing the data to the teacher-
year level. We do so by constructing precision-weighted averages of classroom-average scores within a
teacher-year. The weight for classroom c in year t is

where O 2 is an estimate of the class-level variance component and n ct denotes the number of students in the
classroom. We construct this estimate as O 2 D V ar .Ait /                    O 2"   O A0 , where O A0 is our estimate of the

within-teacher-year between-class covariance in average scores, reflecting the teacher-level component of
the variance. To simplify computation, we follow Kane and Staiger (2008) and randomly sort classrooms
within each teacher-year cell; we then estimate the covariance O A0 based on the covariance of the test scores
of adjacent classrooms in each teacher-year cell, weighting each pair of classrooms by the sum of students
taught.

   We next estimate the covariances between mean scores across years within teacher, denoted O As , in both
elementary and middle schools. We allow a separate covariance for each possible time lag s 2 f1; 2; : : :g
denoting the separation between the two years in which the classes were taught. We weight each teacher-
year pair by the sum of students taught. We set all covariances for lags greater than 7 to O A7 , the estimated
covariance for the 7th lag.

   Step 3: [Construction of VA Estimates] In this step, we use the parameter estimates to construct a VA
estimate for each teacher j in each year t that she appears in the data. We depart from the method described
in Section I.B by using data from all other years – not just years before year t – to increase the precision of
                                          t
our VA estimates.42 Let A             j       denote the vector of teacher-year-mean scores used to predict teacher j’s VA
in year t. Let N jt denote the length of this vector, so that we are using N jt other years to project scores in
year t. We construct the best linear predictor of teacher quality in year t as
                                                                                    0

where        jt   is a N jt     1 vector and 6 A jt is a N jt             N jt matrix. We denote the weights on scores A j t by

   jt   D 6 A 1jt    jt .   If the mth and nth element of the scores vector A j t are A js and A js 0 , the mth element of
the diagonal of 6 A jt in middle school is

                                                                                         1

where the denominator of the second term is the sum of precisions for the classes taught by a teacher in year
s, which is the precision of the teacher-year mean in year s. In elementary school, where teachers teach
one class per year, we cannot estimate O A0 but we can estimate O A0 C O 2 D V ar .Ait /                                O 2" . Here, the mth
element of the diagonal of 6 A jt is

                                                                                               O 2"

  42 Using data from other years increases precision not just by increasing sample size but also because we have more data from nearby years. For
example, data from year t C 1 are more informative for VA in year t than data from year t 2 in the presence of drift.


                                                                          35
In both elementary and middle school, the mnth off-diagonal element of 6 A jt is

                                                             6 A jt   mn
                                                                           D O A;js          s0j


and the mth element of            jt   is

                                                                 jt m    D O A;jt        sj .


Because the distribution of other years in which data are available varies both across teachers j and across
the years t within a teacher, both the matrix 6 A jt and the vector                                jt   will vary across j and t. We therefore
construct these elements separately for each teacher-year in the data. Note that we can use this algorithm
even if data on test scores for teacher j’s students are missing in year t, since those data are not required to
estimate b jt .


Online Appendix B: Teacher-Level Bias


  In this appendix, we define an alternative notion of bias in VA estimates, which we term “teacher-level
bias,” and characterize its relationship to the concept of forecast bias that we focus on in the text.43 For
simplicity, we follow Rothstein (2009) and focus on the case without drift in teacher value-added.44 In this
case,    jt   D    j   in all periods and our estimator for teacher VA simplifies to
                                                                                    2

                                                                    C.          C   " =n/=.t
                                                                                    e                    1/

as shown in (9). Let b j D limt!1 b jt denote the value to which the VA estimate for teacher j converges
as the number of classrooms observed approaches infinity. The asymptotic bias in the estimate of teacher
j’s VA is

(18)                                                           ! j D bj                 j.



Definition 2. Value-added estimates are unbiased at the teacher-level if V ar .! j / D 0.

  VA estimates are biased at the teacher-level if they are inconsistent, i.e. if we systematically mispredict a
given teacher’s performance when estimation error in VA vanishes. Such teacher-level bias is relevant for
determining whether a value-added model treats all teachers equitably.
  Forecast vs. Teacher-Level Bias. To see the connection between teacher-level bias and forecast bias,
consider an experiment in which students are randomly assigned to teachers in year t. By the definition of

  43 We thank Jesse Rothstein for drawing our attention to the distinction between teacher-level bias and forecast bias.
  44 Drift complicates the asymptotics because additional information from prior years does not eliminate estimation error in expected VA.



                                                                           36

where the second step follows because Cov Ait             j ; bj   D 0 under random assignment in year t. Hence,

                                B b j D 0 , V ar .! j / C Cov            j; !j   D 0.

This identity has two implications. First, if VA estimates are unbiased at the teacher-level, they must also
be forecast-unbiased: V ar .! j / D 0 ) B.b j / D 0. Second, and more importantly for our application,
forecast-unbiased VA estimates can be biased at the teacher level only if Cov                   j; !j   D   V ar .! j /.
Intuitively, if the teacher-level bias ! j is negatively correlated with true value-added, then the covariance
of VA estimates with true scores is reduced, but the variance of VA estimates also falls. If the two forces
happen to cancel out exactly, B.b j / could be 0 even if V ar .! j / > 0. In this sense, if a pre-specified
value-added model produces VA estimates b jt that exhibit no forecast bias, the existence of teacher-level
bias is a measure-zero (knife-edge) case.
  Note that estimating the degree of forecast bias is simpler than teacher-level bias because forecast bias
can be directly estimated using finite-sample estimates of b jt without any additional inputs. In contrast,
estimating teacher-level bias requires accounting for the impacts of estimation error on b jt to construct the
limit b j , which is a non-trivial problem, particularly in the presence of drift.


Online Appendix C: Matching Algorithm


  We follow the matching algorithm developed in Chetty et al. (2011) to link the school district data to
tax records. The algorithm was designed to match as many records as possible using variables that are not
contingent on ex post outcomes. Date of birth, gender, and last name in the tax data are populated by the
Social Security Administration using information that is not contingent on ex post outcomes. First name
and ZIP code in tax data are contingent on observing some ex post outcome. First name data derive from
information returns, which are typically generated after an adult outcome like employment (W-2 forms),
college attendance (1098-T forms), or mortgage interest payment (1098 forms).                   The ZIP code on the
claiming parent’s 1040 return is typically from 1996 and is thus contingent on the ex post outcome of the
student not having moved far from her elementary school for most students in our analysis sample.
  Chetty et al. (2011) show that the match algorithm outlined below yields accurate matches for approxi-
mately 99% of cases in a school district sample that can be matched on social security number. Note that

                                                          37
identifiers were used solely for the matching procedure. After the match was completed, the data were de-
identified (i.e., individual identifiers such as names were stripped) and the statistical analysis was conducted
using the de-identified dataset.

  Step 1 [Date of Birth, Gender, Last Name]: We begin by matching each individual from the school-district
data to Social Security Administration (SSA) records. We match individuals based on exact date of birth,
gender, and the first four characters of last name. We only attempt to match individuals for which the school
records include a valid date of birth, gender, and at least one valid last name. SSA records all last names
ever associated in their records with a given individual; in addition, there are as many as three last names
for each individual from the school files. We keep a potential match if any of these three last names match
any of the last names present in the SSA file.

  Step 2 [Rule Out on First Name]: We next check the first name (or names) of individuals from the school
records against information from W2 and other information forms present in the tax records. Since these
files reflect economic activity usually after the completion of school, we use this information in Step 2 only
to “rule out” possible matches in order to minimize selection bias. In particular, we disqualify potential
matches if none of the first names on the information returns match any of the first names in the school
data. As before, we use only the first four characters of a first name. For many potential matches, we
find no first name information in the tax information records; at this step we retain these potential matches.
After removing potential matches that are mismatched on first name, we isolate students for whom only one
potential match remains in the tax records. We declare such cases a match and remove them from the match
pool. We classify the match quality (MQ) of matches identified at this stage as M Q D 1.

  Step 3 [Dependent ZIP code]: For each potential match that remains, we find the household that claimed
the individual as a dependent (if the individual was claimed at all) in each year. We then match the location
of the claiming household, identified by the 5-digit ZIP code, to the home address ZIP code recorded in
the school files. We classify potential matches based on the best ZIP code match across all years using
the following tiers: exact match, match within 10 (e.g., 02139 and 02146 would qualify as a match), match
within 100, and non-match. We retain potential matches only in the highest available tier of ZIP code match
quality. For example, suppose there are 5 potential matches for a given individual, and that there are no
exact matches on ZIP code, two matches within 10, two matches within 100, and one non-match. We would
retain only the two that matched within 10. After this procedure, we isolate students for whom only one
potential match remains in the tax records. We declare such cases a match and remove them from the match
pool. We classify the match quality of matches identified at this stage as M Q D 2.

  Step 4 [Place of Birth]: For each potential match that remains, we match the state of birth from the school
records with the state of birth as identified in SSA records. We classify potential matches into three groups:

                                                      38
state of birth matches, state of birth does not match but the SSA state is the state where the school district
is, and mismatches. Note that we include the second category primarily to account for the immigrants in
the school data for whom the recorded place of birth is outside the country. For such children, the SSA
state-of-birth corresponds to the state in which they received the social security number, which is often the
first state in which they lived after coming to the country. We retain potential matches only in the best
available tier of place-of-birth match quality. We then isolate students for whom only one potential match
remains in the tax records. We declare such cases a match and remove them from the match pool. We
classify the match quality of matches identified at this stage as M Q D 3.


  Step 5 [Rule In on First Name]: After exhausting other available information, we return to the first name.
In step 2 we retained potential matches that either matched on first name or for which there was no first
name available. In this step, we retain only potential matches that match on first name, if such a potential
match exists for a given student. We also use information on first name present on 1040 forms filed by
potential matches as adults to identify matches at this stage. We then isolate students for whom only one
potential match remains in the tax records. We declare such cases a match and remove them from the match
pool. We classify the match quality of matches identified at this stage as M Q D 4.


  Step 6 [Fuzzy Date-of Birth]: In previous work (Chetty et al. 2011), we found that 2-3% of individuals
had a reported date of birth that was incorrect. In some cases the date was incorrect only by a few days;
in others the month or year was off by one, or the transcriber transposed the month and day. To account
for this possibility, we take all individuals for whom no eligible matches remained after step 2. Note that
if any potential matches remained after step 2, then we would either settle on a unique best match in the
steps that follow or find multiple potential matches even after step 5. We then repeat step 1, matching on
gender, first four letters of last name, and fuzzy date-of-birth. We define a fuzzy DOB match as one where
the absolute value of the difference between the DOB reported in the SSA and school data was in the set
f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 9; 10; 18; 27g in days, the set f1; 2g in months, or the set f1g in years. We then repeat steps 2
through 5 exactly as above to find additional matches. We classify matches found using this fuzzy-DOB
algorithm as M Q D 5:X , where X is the corresponding M Q from the non-fuzzy DOB algorithm. For
instance, if we find a unique fuzzy-DOB match in step 3 using dependent ZIP codes, then M Q D 5:2.


  The following table shows the distribution of match qualities for all students. We match 88.6% of students
and 89.8% of student-subject observations in the analysis sample used to calculate VA. Unmatched students
are split roughly evenly among those for whom we found multiple matches and those for whom we found
no match.

Online Appendix D: Unconditional Sorting of Students to Teachers


  In this appendix, we assess the unconditional relationship between teacher VA and student observables
to determine whether high VA teachers are systematically assigned to certain types of students (see Section
IV.C). We are able to study such unconditional sorting because our method of constructing student test score
residuals in (5) only exploits within-teacher variation. Prior studies that estimate VA typically construct test
score residuals using both between- and within-teacher variation and thus do not necessarily obtain a global
ranking. For example, suppose schools with higher SES students have better teachers. By residualizing
test scores with respect to student SES before computing teacher VA, one would attribute the differences in
outcomes across these schools to differences in student SES rather than teacher quality. As a result, one
only obtains a relative ranking of teachers conditional on student SES and cannot compare teacher quality
across students with different characteristics. Using within-teacher variation to estimate the coefficients on
the control vector Xit resolves this problem and yields a global ranking of teachers across the school district.
  To estimate unconditional sorting of students to teachers based on observable characteristics Xit , one
would ideally regress teacher VA     jt   on Xit :

(19)                                             jt   D   C Xit C          it .


Since true VA is unobserved, we substitute VA estimates b jt for                  jt   on the left hand side of (19). This yields
an attenuated estimate of   because b jt is shrunk toward 0 to account for estimation error (see Section I.B).
If all teachers taught the same number of classes and had the same number of students, the shrinkage factor
would not vary across observations. In this case, we could identify                     by using b jt as the dependent variable
in (19) and multiplying the estimate of      by S D.      jt /=S D.b jt /.    In the sample for which we observe lagged
test scores, the standard deviation of teacher VA estimates is S D.                       jt /=S D.b jt /   D 1:56. We therefore
multiply the estimate of    obtained from estimating (19) with b jt as the dependent variable by 1:56. This

                                                            40
simple approach to correcting for the attenuation bias is an approximation because the shrinkage factor does
vary across observations. However, our estimates of the magnitudes of unconditional sorting are small and
hence further adjusting for the variation in shrinkage factors is unlikely to affect our conclusions.
  We report estimates of unconditional sorting in Appendix Table 2. Each column reports estimates of
an OLS regression of VA estimates b jt on various observables (multiplied by 1.56), with standard errors
clustered at the teacher level to account for correlated errors in the assignment process of classrooms to
teachers.
  We begin in Column 1 by regressing b jt on lagged test scores Ai;t 1 .           Better students are assigned
slightly better teachers: students who score 1 unit higher in the previous grade get a teacher whose VA is
0.0122 better on average. The tracking of better students to better teachers magnifies gaps in achievement,
although the magnitude of this amplification effect is small relative to other determinants of the variance in
student achievement.
  Column 2 shows that special education students are assigned teachers with 0.003 lower VA on average.
Again, this effect is statistically different from zero, but is quantitatively small. Relative to other students
with similar prior test scores, special education students receive slightly higher VA teachers (not reported).
  In Column 3, we regress b jt on parent income. A $10,000 (0.3 SD) increase in parent income raises
teacher VA by 0.00084, with the null hypothesis of 0 correlation rejected with p < 0:0001.              Column
4 demonstrates that controlling for a student’s lagged test score Ai;t    1   entirely eliminates the correlation
between teacher VA and parent income.
  Column 5 analyzes the correlation between teacher VA and ethnicity. Mean teacher quality is no different
on average across minority (Hispanic or Black) vs. non-minority students.
  Finally, Columns 6 and 7 analyze the relationship between teacher value-added and school-level demo-
graphics. The relationship between mean parent income in a school and teacher quality remains quite small
(Column 6) and there is no relationship between fraction minority and school quality.
  Finally, we assess the extent to which differences in teacher quality contribute to the gap in achievement
by family income. In the sample used to estimate VA, a $10,000 increase in parental income is associated
with a 0.065 SD increase in 8th grade test scores (averaging across math and English). To calculate how
much smaller this gradient would be if teacher VA did not vary with parent income, we must take a stance on
how teachers’ impacts cumulate over time. In our companion paper, we estimate that 1 unit improvement
in teacher VA in a given grade raises achievement by approximately 0.53 units after 1 year, 0.36 after 2
years, and stabilizes at approximately 0.25 after 3 years (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2014, Appendix
Table 10). Under the assumption that teacher effects are additive across years, these estimates of fade-out
imply that a 1 unit improvement in teacher quality in all grades K-8 would raise 8th grade test scores by

                                                      41

3.4 units. Using the estimate in Column 3 of Appendix Table 2, it follows that only                      0:065
                                                                                                                    D 4% of
the income-score gradient can be attributed to differences in teacher quality from grades K-8. However, a
sequence of good teachers can close a significant portion of the achievement gap. If teacher quality for low
income students were improved by 0.1 units in all grades from K-8, 8th grade scores would rise by 0.34,
enough to offset more than a $50,000 difference in family income.

Online Appendix E: Quasi-Experimental Estimator of Forecast Bias


  This appendix shows that estimating (15) using OLS identifies the degree of forecast bias under Assump-
tion 3. Recall that we define the degree of forecast bias B D 1               based on the best linear predictor of Ait
in a randomized experiment in year t:

                                         E [Ait j1; b jt ] D   t   C b jt .

In the observational data, we can decompose test scores in year t into the effect of teacher VA E [Ait j1; b jt ]
and student-level errors   it :



                                            Ait D   t   C b jt C      it ,

where    it   may be correlated with b jt because of non-random assignment. Taking averages over all the
students in a school-grade cell and first-differencing gives the quasi-experimental specification in (15):

                                       1Asgt D      C 1Q sgt C 1             sgt ,


where Q sgt is the mean of b jt in school s in grade g in year t. It follows immediately that estimating (15)
using OLS yields an unbiased estimate of      under Assumption 3 (1              sgt   orthogonal to 1Q sgt ).

Notes: All statistics reported are for the sample used in estimating the baseline value-added model, as described in
Section III.C. This sample includes only students who have non-missing lagged test scores and other requisite
controls to estimate the VA model. Number of observations is number of classrooms in the first row, number of
students in the second row, and number of student-subject-year observations in all other rows. Student data are from
the administrative records of a large urban school district in the U.S. Parent characteristics are measured between
2005-2007 from federal income tax data. All monetary values are expressed in real 2010 dollars. All ages refer to the
age of an individual as of December 31 within a given year. Test score is based on standardized scale scores, as
described in Section II.A. Free lunch is an indicator for receiving free or reduced-price lunches. We link students to
their parents by finding the earliest 1040 form from 1996-2011 on which the student is claimed as a dependent.
Conditional on being matched to the tax data, we are unable to link 2.4% of students to their parents; the summary
statistics for parents exclude these observations. Parent income is average adjusted gross income during the tax-
years 2005-2007. For parents who do not file, household income is defined as zero. Home ownership is defined as
reporting mortgage interest payments on a 1040 or 1099 form in any year between 2005-2007. Contributed to a
401(k) is an indicator for ever contributing to a 401(k) between 2005-2007. Marital status is measured by whether the
claiming parent files a joint return at any point between 2005-2007. Parent age at child birth is the difference between
the age of the mother (or father if single father) and the student. Predicted score is predicted from a regression of
scores on parent characteristics using the estimating equation in Section IV.

Notes: Panel A reports the estimated autocovariance, the standard error of that covariance estimate clustered at the
teacher level (in parentheses), and the autocorrelation (in brackets) of average test score residuals between classrooms
taught by the same teacher. We measure these statistics at time lags ranging from one (i.e. two classrooms taught one
year apart) to ten years (i.e., two classrooms taught ten years apart), weighting by the sum of the relevant pair of class
sizes. Each covariance is estimated separately for English and math and for elementary and middle school classrooms.
Panel B reports the raw standard deviation of test score residuals and decomposes this variation into components driven
by idiosyncratic student-level variation, classroom shocks, and teacher-level variation. The variances in rows 2 and 3 of
Panel B sum to that in row 1; the variances in rows 4 and 5 sum to that in row 3. In middle school, we estimate the
standard deviation of teacher effects as the square root of the covariance of mean score residuals across a random pair
of classrooms within the same year. In elementary schools, we cannot separately identify class-level and teacher-level
standard deviations because we observe only one classroom per year. We use the square root of the autocovariance
across classrooms at a one year lag to estimate a lower bound on the within-year standard deviation for elementary
schools. We also report an estimate of the standard deviation by regressing the log of first seven autocovariances in
Panel A on the time lag and time lag squared and extrapolating to 0 to estimate the within-year covariance.

Notes: Each column reports coefficients from an OLS regression, with standard errors clustered by school-
cohort in parentheses. The regressions are run on the sample used to estimate the baseline VA model,
restricted to observations with a non-missing leave-out teacher VA estimate. There is one observation for
each student-subject-school year in all regressions. Teacher VA is scaled in units of student test score
standard deviations and is estimated using data from classes taught by the same teacher in other years,
following the procedure in Sections I.B and III. Teacher VA is estimated using the baseline control vector,
which includes: a cubic in lagged own- and cross-subject scores, interacted with the student's grade level;
student-level characteristics including ethnicity, gender, age, lagged suspensions and absences, and
indicators for grade repetition, special education, and limited English; class size and class-type indicators;
cubics in class and school-grade means of lagged own- and cross-subject scores, interacted with grade
level; class and school-year means of all the student-level characteristics; and grade and year dummies.
When prior test scores in the other subject are missing, we set the other subject prior score to 0 and include
an indicator for missing data in the other subject interacted with the controls for prior own-subject test
scores. In Columns 1 and 3, the dependent variable is the student’s test score in a given year and subject.
In Column 2, the dependent variable is the predicted value generated from a regression of test score on
mother's age at child's birth, indicators for parent's 401(k) contributions and home ownership, and an
indicator for the parent's marital status interacted with a quartic in parent household income, after
residualizing all variables with respect to the baseline control vector. In Column 4, the dependent variable is
the predicted value generated in the same way from twice-lagged test scores. See Section IV.B for details of
the estimating equation for predicted scores.

Notes: Each column reports coefficients from an OLS regression, with standard errors clustered by school-cohort in parentheses. The regressions are
estimated on a dataset containing school-grade-subject-year means from the core sample described in Section II.C, excluding classrooms in which we
cannot construct the leave-two-year-out VA estimate described below. All regressions are weighted by the number of students in the school-grade-subject-
year cell. We calculate changes in mean teacher VA across consecutive cohorts within a school-grade-subject cell as follows. First, we calculate teacher
VA for each teacher in a school-grade-subject cell in each adjacent pair of school years using information excluding those two years. We then calculate
mean VA across all teachers, weighting by the number of students they teach. Finally, we compute the difference in mean teacher VA (year t minus year t-
1) to obtain the independent variable. The dependent variables are defined by calculating the change in the mean of the dependent variable (year t minus
year t-1) within a school-grade-subject cell. In Columns 1-3, the dependent variable is the change in mean test scores within subject (English or math). In
Column 4, it is the change in the predicted score, constructed based on parental characteristics, as described in Section V.D. In Columns 5 and 6, the
dependent variable is the change in the score in the other subject (e.g. math scores for English teachers). Column 5 restricts the sample to middle schools,
where different teachers teach math and English; Column 6 restricts the sample to elementary schools, where the same teacher teaches the two subjects.
Column 1 includes only year fixed effects and no other controls. Columns 2 and 4 include school-by-year fixed effects. In Column 3, we add a cubic in the
change in mean lagged scores to the specification in Column 2, as well as controls for the lead and lag change in mean teacher value-added. Columns 5
and 6 control for the change in mean teacher VA in the other subject as well as year fixed effects.

Notes: Each column reports coefficients from a regression with standard errors clustered by school-cohort in
parentheses. The regressions are estimated on a dataset containing school-grade-subject-year means from the
core sample described in Section II.C. The dependent variable in all specifications is the change in the mean test
scores (year t minus year t-1) within a school-grade-subject cell. The independent variable is the change in mean
teacher VA across consecutive cohorts within a school-grade-subject cell; see notes to Table 4 for details on the
construction of this variable. All regressions are weighted by the number of students in the school-grade-subject-
year cell and include year fixed effects. In column 1, we report 2SLS estimates, instrumenting for changes in mean
teacher VA with the fraction of students in the prior cohort taught by teachers who leave the school multiplied by the
mean-VA among these school-leavers. Columns 2-4 replicate the specification in Column 1 of Table 4, varying the
way in which we handle classrooms with missing teacher VA. Column 2 includes all classrooms, imputing the
sample mean VA (0) to classrooms with missing teacher VA. Column 3 replicates Column 2, excluding entire
school-grade-subject-year cells in which more than 25% of student observations have missing teacher VA. Column
4 restricts to entire school-grade-subject-year cells with no missing teacher VA. The last row reports the
percentage of students for whom teacher VA is not imputed in each estimation sample.

Notes: In this table, we estimate seven alternative VA models and report correlations of the resulting
VA estimates with the baseline VA estimates in Column 1. In Column 2, we report quasi-
experimental estimates of forecast bias for each model, defined as 1 minus the coefficient in a
regression of the cross-cohort change in scores on the cross-cohort change in mean teacher VA.
These coefficients are estimated using exactly the specification in Column 1 of Table 4. All the VA
models are estimated on a constant sample of students for whom all the variables in the baseline
control vector are non-missing. All models are estimated separately by school level and subject; the
correlations and estimates of forecast bias pool VA estimates across all groups. Each model only
varies the control vector used to estimate student test score residuals in equation (4); the remaining
steps of the procedure used to construct VA estimates (described in Appendix A) are the same for
all the models. Model 1 replicates the baseline model as a reference; see notes to Table 3 for
definition of the baseline control vector. The estimated forecast bias for this model coincides with
that implied by Column 1 of Table 4. Model 2 uses all of the baseline controls but omits teacher fixed
effects when estimating equation (5), so that the coefficients on the controls are identified from both
within- and between-teacher variation as in traditional VA specifications. Model 3 includes all the
controls in the baseline specification as well as indicators for years of teacher experience; teachers
with 6 or more years of experience are pooled into a single group and are the omitted category.
Model 4 includes only student, class and school level test score controls from the baseline control
vector along with grade and year fixed effects. Model 5 includes only cubic polynomials in prior-year
scores in math and English along with grade and year fixed effects. Model 6 replicates model 5,
dropping the cubic polynomial for prior scores in the other subject. Model 7 removes all controls
related to test scores from the baseline specification, leaving only non-score controls at the student,
class, and school level (e.g., demographics, free lunch participation, etc.). Model 8 drops all

Notes: This table illustrates the structure of the core sample, which combines information from the school
district database and the tax data. There is one row for each student-subject-school year. Students who were
not linked to the tax data have missing data on parent characteristics. The values in this table are not real data
and are for illustrative purposes only.

Notes: Each column reports coefficients from an OLS regression, with standard errors clustered by teacher in parentheses. Teacher VA,
which is the dependent variable in all columns, is scaled in units of student test score standard deviations. Teacher VA is estimated using
data from classes taught by the same teacher in other years, following the procedure in Sections II.B and 4 and using the baseline control
vector (see notes to Table 3 for more details). The regressions are run at the student-subject-year level on the sample used to estimate
the baseline VA model. We multiply the resulting regression coefficients by 1.56 to account for the attenuation bias due to using VA
estimates instead of true VA as the dependent variable (see Appendix D for details). Columns 3 and 4 restrict the sample to students
whom we are able to link to parents in the tax data. Each specification includes the student-level covariate(s) listed at the left hand side of
the table and no additional control variables. See notes to Table 1 for definitions of these independent variables. In Columns 6-7, the
independent variable is the school-mean of the independent variables in Columns 3 and 5, respectively. We calculate these means as the
unweighted mean across all student-subject-year observations with non-missing data for the relevant variable in each school.

Notes: These figures show the correlation between mean test-score residuals across classes taught by the same teacher in
different years. Panels A and B plot autocorrelation vectors for elementary and middle school. To calculate these vectors,
we first residualize test scores using within-teacher variation with respect to our baseline control vector (see notes to Table
3). We then calculate a (precision-weighted) mean test score residual across classrooms for each teacher-year. Finally, we
calculate the autocorrelation coefficients as the correlation across years for a given teacher, weighting by the sum of students
taught in the two years. See Appendix A for more details on the estimation procedure for these and other parameters of the
value-added model.

Notes: These figures pool all grades and subjects and are constructed using the sample used to estimate the VA model, which
has one observation per student-subject-school year. The three panels are binned scatter plots of actual scores, predicted
scores based on parent characteristics, and predicted scores based on twice-lagged test scores vs. teacher VA. These plots
correspond to the regressions in Columns 1, 2, and 4 of Table 3 and use the same sample restrictions and variable definitions.
To construct these binned scatter plots, we first residualize the y-axis variable with respect to the baseline control vector
(defined in the notes to Table 3) separately within each subject by school-level cell, using within-teacher variation to estimate
the coefficients on the controls as described in Section I.B. We then divide the VA estimates µ̂jt into twenty equal-sized groups
(vingtiles) and plot the means of the y-variable residuals within each bin against the mean value of µ̂jt within each bin. The
solid line shows the best linear fit estimated on the underlying micro data using OLS. The coefficients show the estimated
slope of the best-fit line, with standard errors clustered at the school-cohort level reported in parentheses.

Notes: These figures plot event studies of current scores (solid line) and scores in the previous school year (dashed line) by
cohort as teachers enter or leave a school-grade-subject cell in year t = 0. Panels A and B analyze the entry and exit of a
high-VA teacher (teachers with VA in the top 5% of the distribution); Panels C and D analyze the entry and exit of a low-VA
(bottom 5%) teacher. All panels are plotted using the core sample collapsed to school-grade-subject-year means, as described
in Section V.B. To construct each panel, we first identify the set of teachers who entered or exited a school-grade-subject cell
and define event time as the school year relative to the year of entry or exit. We then estimate each teacher’s value-added
in event year t = 0 using data from classes taught excluding event years t ∈ [=3, 2]. In Panel A, we identify the subset of
teachers with VA estimates in the top 5% of the distribution among entering teachers. We then plot mean current and lagged
scores in the relevant school-grade-subject cell for the event years before and after the entry of such a teacher. Panels B-D are
constructed analogously. We demean test scores by school year to eliminate secular time trends and normalize the residual
scores to zero at event year t = −3 for teacher entry and at event year t = 2 for teacher exit. Each panel reports the change in
mean score gains (current minus lag scores) from t = −1 to t = 0 and the change in mean estimated VA. We report p-values
from F tests of the hypotheses that the change in score gains from t = −1 to t = 0 equals the change in mean VA and that the
change in score gains equals 0. Mean teacher VA is calculated using a student-weighted average, imputing the sample mean
VA (0) for teachers who do not have data outside the t ∈ [−3, 2] window necessary to compute a leave-out VA estimate.

Notes: This figure plots changes in average test scores across cohorts versus changes in average teacher VA across cohorts,
generalizing the event study in Figure 3 to include all changes in teaching staff. Panel A is a binned scatterplot of changes in
actual scores vs. changes in mean VA, corresponding to the regression in Column 1 of Table 4. Panel B is a binned scatterplot
of changes in predicted scores based on parent characteristics vs. changes in mean VA, corresponding to the regression in
Column 4 of Table 4. See notes to Table 4 for details on variable definitions and sample restrictions. Both panels are plotted
using the core sample collapsed to school-grade-subject-year means, as described in Section V.C. To construct these binned
scatter plots, we first demean both the x- and y-axis variables by school year to eliminate any secular time trends. We then
divide the observations into twenty equal-size groups (vingtiles) based on their change in mean VA and plot the means of
the y variable within each bin against the mean change in VA within each bin, weighting by the number of students in each
school-grade-subject-year cell. The solid line shows the best linear fit estimated on the underlying micro data using a weighted
OLS regression as in Table 4. The coefficients show the estimated slope of the best-fit line, with standard errors clustered at
the school-cohort level reported in parentheses.

Notes: This figure plots changes in average test scores in the other subject across cohorts versus changes in average teacher VA,
controlling for changes in other-subject VA. Panel A restricts the sample to middle schools, corresponding to the regression
in Column 5 of Table 4. Panel B restricts the sample to elementary schools, corresponding to the regression in Column 6 of
Table 4. See notes to Table 4 for details on variable definitions and sample restrictions. Both panels are plotted using the core
sample collapsed to school-grade-subject-year means, as described in Section V.C. To construct these binned scatter plots,
we first regress both the x- and y-axis variables on changes in mean teacher VA in the other subject as well as year fixed
effects and compute residuals, weighting by the number of students in each school-grade-subject-year cell. We then divide the
x residuals into twenty equal-size groups (vingtiles) and plot the means of the y residuals within each bin against the mean of
the x residuals within each bin, again weighting by the number of students in each school-grade-subject-year cell. The solid
line shows the best linear fit estimated on the underlying micro data using a weighted OLS regression as in Table 4. The
coefficients show the estimated slope of the best-fit line, with standard errors clustered at the school-cohort level reported in

Notes: This figure plots kernel densities of the empirical distribution of teacher VA estimates µ̂jt for each subject (math and
English) and school-level (elementary and middle school). The densities are weighted by the number of student test score
observations used to construct the teacher VA estimate and are estimated using a bandwidth of 0.01. We also report the
standard deviations of these empirical distributions of VA estimates. Note that these standard deviations are smaller than the
standard deviation of true teacher effects reported in Table 2 because VA estimates are shrunk toward the mean to account
for noise and obtain unbiased forecasts.
