                                                ABSTRACT

The focus of policy reform in developing countries has moved from getting prices right to getting
institutions right, and accordingly countries are increasingly being advised to move towards "best-practice"
institutions. This paper argues that appropriate institutions for developing countries are instead "second-best"
institutions -- those that take into account context-specific market and government failures that cannot
be removed in short order. Such institutions will often diverge greatly from best practice. The argument
is illustrated using examples from four areas: contract enforcement, entrepreneurship, trade openness,
and macroeconomic stability.

                                        SECOND-BEST INSTITUTIONS

                                                Dani Rodrik*
                                                January 2008

          The focus of reforms in the developing world has moved from getting prices right to

getting institutions right. This reflects the recognition that markets are unlikely to work well in

the absence of a predictable and legitimate set of rules that support economic activity and

dispense its fruits. “Governance reforms” have become the buzzword for bilateral donors and

multilateral institutions, in much the same way that liberalization, privatization and stabilization

were the mantras of the 1980s.

          But what kind of institutions should reformers strive to build? It is easier to list the

functions that good institutions perform than it is to describe the shape they should take.

Desirable institutions provide security of property rights, enforce contracts, stimulate

entrepreneurship, foster integration in the world economy, maintain macroeconomic stability,

manage risk-taking by financial intermediaries, supply social insurance and safety nets, and

enhance voice and accountability. But as the variety of institutional forms that prevail in the

advanced countries themselves suggests (Richard Freeman 2000, Peter Hall and David Soskice

2001), each one of these ends can be achieved in a large number of different ways (Dani Rodrik

2007).

          Furthermore, developing nations are different from advanced countries in that they face

both greater challenges and more constraints. That this may require “appropriate” institutions

differing from those that prevail in rich countries is an old theme that goes back at least to

Alexander Gerschenkron (1962). This theme has been picked up in a number of recent analyses.

For example, Daron Acemoglu et al. (2006) argue that countries that are distant from the global

technology frontier, and where the main challenge is stimulating investment rather than

innovation, may benefit from institutional arrangements that privilege incumbent firms over

entrants because these generate the rents that finance the requisite investments. Yingyi Qian

(2003) has ascribed China’s success to the adoption of a variety of transitional and heterodox

institutions that managed to provide efficient incentives while maintaining the rents of those who

are politically powerful. Avinash Dixit (2004) has argued that self-enforcing governance

arrangements can be more efficient than formal institutions in early stages of economic

development in light of the large fixed costs of setting up the latter. Simeon Djankov et al.

(2003) conceptualize institutions as a spectrum that runs the full gamut between private ordering

(with no room for public enforcement) to state ownership (with no room for private enterprise),

and argue that the appropriate choice depends on a society’s initial conditions.

       Yet this literature appears to have had very little impact on operational practices. The

type of institutional reform promoted by multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, IMF,

or the World Trade Organization is heavily biased towards a best-practice model. It presumes it

is possible to determine a unique set of appropriate institutional arrangements ex ante and views

convergence towards those arrangements as inherently desirable. One of its apparent virtues is

that it enables cross-national comparisons and benchmarking: institutional performance can be

measured by, say, counting the number of days it takes to register a firm in different countries or

settle a commercial dispute in courts. This approach is grounded in a first-best mindset which

presumes the primary role of institutional arrangements is to minimize transaction costs in the

immediately relevant domain--without paying attention to potential interactions with institutional

features elsewhere in the system.
                                                   3

         I shall argue that dealing with the institutional landscape in developing economies

requires a second-best mindset. In such settings, a focus on best-practice institutions not only

creates blind spots, leading us to overlook reforms that might achieve the desired ends at lower

cost, it can also backfire. I will elaborate on this point using illustrations from four areas:

contract enforcement, entrepreneurship, trade openness, and macroeconomic stability.



I. Courts and contract enforcement

         Consider the legal environment in which firms operate in most countries of Sub-Saharan

Africa. Even though there are commercial laws on the books that govern the settlement of

contractual disputes, courts are highly inefficient, costly to use, and potentially corruptible. Firms

therefore rarely resort to them in practice. When Ghanaian firms were asked whether they would

go to court following a dispute with a supplier or a client, fewer than 10 percent answered in the

affirmative (Marcel Fafchamps 2004, Table 4.5). Lacking legal recourse, firms resort instead to

relational contracting: they build long-term, personalized relationships with their suppliers or

consumers, and sustain cooperation through repeated interaction. In addition, they screen

potential business partners by gathering information about them, inspect goods on delivery prior

to payment, and are often willing to renegotiate when contract terms are not fulfilled (Fafchamps

2004).

         This brief description of the contracting environment suggests that a weak judiciary

imposes significant costs on doing business in Africa. It is only one short step to conclude that a

package of judicial reforms—aimed at strengthening the capacity, autonomy, and honesty of

courts—is an important priority for the region.
                                                  4

       But now consider the situation in Vietnam, where the private sector has been booming

and the economy has been growing at 8 percent a year. The legal environment is, if anything, in

worse shape there than it is in most of Africa. In their surveys of firms, John McMillan and

Christopher Woodruff (1999) found that there was little confidence in the courts and very little

resort to them. Firms relied instead on relational contracting, just as in Africa. The strategies

were in fact quite similar: build long-term relationships based on trust, demand immediate

payment, screen out unreliable firms, and renegotiate when things run into trouble.

       Why is relational contracting able to sustain so much more economic activity in Vietnam

than it does in African settings? I don’t know. But we can nonetheless draw some implications

from this comparison. First, even if the formal system of contract enforcement is weak, the

contracting environment can still be conducive to high growth in the presence of informal

substitutes. Obviously, the legal system has (so far) not constrained the growth of Vietnam’s

private sector. Second, the knee-jerk reaction that the apparent weakness of courts in Africa

requires an immediate remedy in the form of judicial reform may well be misplaced. Since

relational contracting in Africa has so many of the same features of that in Vietnam, perhaps it is

not the inadequacies of the legal system that constrains Africa’s growth either.

       Third, and more intriguingly, an effort to strengthen judicial (third-party) enforcement

can easily do more harm than good in the presence of relational contracting. Imagine that some

of the firms begin to think that they can rely on courts and therefore don’t care about the

reputation of the suppliers that they work with. Since suppliers that cheat now have an improved

outside option, the discipline that prevents opportunistic behavior in relational contracts is

undermined (Dixit 2004, chap. 2). This raises transaction costs for firms that continue to regard

courts as ineffective.
                                                  5

       Thinking in these second-best terms also suggest avenues of reform that may have been

easily overlooked. Perhaps it is more effective to enhance relational contracting—for example by

improving information gathering and dissemination about the reputation of firms—than to invest

(at the current stage of a country’s development at least) in first-class legal institutions. Perhaps

early efforts at reforming formal contract enforcement institutions should focus on specific

categories of firms that do not have access to relational contracting—foreign firms or new

firms—instead of targeting all firms across the board.

II. Entry regulations and entrepreneurship

       Entrepreneurship can be suppressed for a variety of reasons. Entry costs may be high,

property rights may not be well protected, the contracting environment may be poor (either

because relational contracting does not work well or the courts are ineffective), or the perceived

returns may be low. The World Bank’s Doing Business Surveys and Investment Climate

Assessments focus on some of these impediments while neglecting others, potentially skewing

institutional reform strategies. In particular, costs associated with the regulatory and legal

regimes figure prominently, while costs relating to relational contracting or market imperfections

are entirely absent.

       Consider entry regulations. Licensing and registration requirements that raise the cost of

entry reduce competition and generate rents for incumbents. In one view the world, this is an

unmitigated bad because it generates static inefficiencies and possibly also undermines

productivity growth over time through the dynamics of entrepreneurial selection. In a first-best

world, that would be the end of the story. But in a second-best world, rents can be useful to

stimulate entrepreneurship. In fact, rents may well be a necessary condition for adequate levels

of entrepreneurship to emerge in non-traditional economic activities.
                                                  6

       This point is made in Ricardo Hausmann and Rodrik (2003) using a particular model of

entrepreneurship that may be particularly relevant to developing countries. In this model,

entrepreneurs provide a cost-discovery function: by engaging in new economic activities, they

help map out the underlying cost structure of the economy, providing valuable information to

other entrepreneurs about what can be produced profitably and what can not. This kind of

informational spillover implies that the requisite level of entrepreneurship is generically under-

supplied in competitive situations. In fact, under free entry, the incentive to engage in cost

discovery is eliminated totally: if I discover, say, that pineapple canning is a profitable economic

activity my profits are quickly socialized through imitative entry, while if I discover that it was a

mistake to invest in that activity, I bear the losses in full. There needs to be some rents in

equilibrium, maintained through entry restrictions or other means, for entrepreneurship of this

kind to be provided at all. Bailey Klinger and Daniel Lederman (2006) provide some evidence

that entry barriers may indeed promote new export activities.

        More generally, rents play a useful role in sustaining long-term relational contracts of the

sort discussed in the previous section. When entrepreneurs do not earn rents which they can

share with their suppliers, they have no carrot with which they can induce “honest” behavior on

the part of the latter. And when creditors earn no rents, they have little incentive to monitor

borrowers and improve project selection (Thomas Hellman et al. 1997). The paper by Acemoglu

et al. (2006) I referred to earlier emphasizes the growth-enhancing role of such rent-sustained

relationships early in the development process. In all these settings, a moderate amount of entry

restrictions helps because foregone efficiency gains are more than offset by improvements in

dynamic incentives.
                                                    7

        These considerations suggest that a single-minded effort to reduce entry regulations may

not only fail to produce the intended effects, it can also backfire when the binding constraint is

expected returns that are too small rather than inadequate competition. Appropriate reform

strategy requires having a good fix on the binding constraint.

III. Import liberalization and global integration

        Suppose you want to open yourself up to international trade and integrate into the global

economy. The textbooks (and the WTO) suggest you accomplish this by eliminating quantitative

restrictions and other administrative measures on trade and by lowering your import tariffs.

        But a striking feature of the global experience with trade liberalization over the last half

century is that the most successful globalizers among developing countries adopted institutional

arrangements that look quite different. South Korea and Taiwan instituted a regime of export

subsidies in the 1960s, highly differentiated by product and targeted at non-traditional exports.

Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Thailand relied heavily on export-processing zones,

as did Mauritius, a rare African globalization success story. China relied on a combination of

export incentives and Special Economic Zones. In none of these countries did tariff cuts on

imports play a significant role in fostering outward orientation early on. Chile is perhaps the only

case that fits what most economists and policy advisers would consider “best-practice” in trade

liberalization.

        What is going on here? One could argue that the manner in which outward orientation is

achieved is immaterial since export promotion is the same as import liberalization (thanks to the

Lerner symmetry theorem). But this argument overlooks the highly specific nature of the export

incentives provided by the Asian countries, and in any case only further highlights the puzzle of

why these countries did not choose the much simpler route of import liberalization.
                                                 8

       An important feature of these alternative paths to global integration is that they generate

supply incentives at the margin for new tradable activities, without removing protection for

existing activities. That in turn has two advantages, one having to do with efficiency and the

other with political economy. The efficiency reason is that the Asian model of liberalization

protects employment in the transition to the new long-run equilibrium. When new export

oriented activities are slow to arise—due either to overvalued exchange rates or to market

failures that hinder supply incentives for non-traditional products—import liberalization may

result in workers in previously protected industries being displaced and transferred into even less

productive activities such as informality or unemployment. Indeed, Latin America’s poor

economy-wide TFP performance and its expanding informality during the 1990s can be ascribed

in part to the conventional program of import liberalization that was administered in the region.

Export subsidies, EPZs, and SEZ instead create new opportunities at the margin, while

minimizing the squeeze on import-competing activities.

       The political economy advantage is now easy to see. The sequential, marginal nature of

the Asian model of liberalization blunts the adverse impact on the firms in import-competing

sectors and therefore removes an important obstacle to trade reform. For example, the Mauritian

EPZ enabled an export boom in the midst of a highly protected domestic economy and despite

the political power of import-substituting industrialists who would never have allowed across-

the-board import liberalization at the time.

       The lesson here is that a particular economic objective—outward orientation—can be

achieved through a number of different institutional designs, and sometimes it is worth doing

things in an unorthodox, round-about way if this will serve to relax other constraints elsewhere in

the system.

IV. Credibility of monetary policy and economic performance

       One of the most striking institutional innovations in the developing world in the last two

decades has been the spread of independent central banks operating under strict rules. Given the

experience with high inflation and macroeconomic instability in the 1970s and 1980s, it is easy

to understand the appeal of these reforms. Central bank independence removes monetary policy

from the day-to-day control of politicians and therefore enhances credibility of anti-inflationary

policies. Along with much improved fiscal policies, it has no doubt contributed to the return of

macroeconomic stability in Latin America and other parts of the world suffering from high

inflation. Together with inflation targeting and flexible exchange rates, it now defines the best-

practice in monetary policy towards which the IMF goads countries under its influence.

       But such institutional arrangements begin to look like a worse bargain when low inflation

is no longer the over-arching goal of monetary policy, and in particular when currency

competitiveness becomes a serious concern. The cross-country evidence is highly suggestive

with regard to the growth benefits of currency undervaluation (Rodrik 2008), and it is telling that

few of the central banks in Asia are independent. As many governments are finding out, it is very

difficult to get the central bank to respond to currency concerns when it has been locked into a

price-stability objective and when its responsiveness to the government has been diminished

through independence.

       Argentina’s convertibility experiment during the 1990s illustrates in extreme form both

the benefits and costs of institutional lock-in. The convertibility law was an ingenious

institutional innovation through which the government was able to relax the most binding

constraint at the time: the lack of policy credibility on the monetary policy front. The plan

worked as long as the constraint remained unchanged. But once the binding constraint became
                                                 10

lack of competitiveness, following the Asian financial crisis and the Brazilian devaluation in

particular, rigid rules that prevented currency depreciation became the problem rather than the

solution. Ultimately, neither convertibility nor central bank independence survived the ensuing

crisis. As Alejandro Neut and Andres Velasco (2003) show, pre-commitments can actually

undermine credibility when unforeseen circumstances render flexibility desirable ex-post.

       The lesson here is that institutional rigidity pays off when lack of credibility and time

inconsistency are the main problems of the day, but that it can eventually become a drag on

growth. No single set of best practices will serve the needs of all countries at all times.

V. Concluding remarks

       Governments can learn a lot by looking at what works and doesn’t in other settings.

Codifying this experience is no doubt a useful exercise. But real-world reformers operate in a

second-best environment of their own, which means they need to keep an eye on how proposed

solutions affect multiple distortions. Sometimes binding constraints will lie elsewhere and they

need to guard against adverse interactions with other distorted margins. At other times, there will

be multiple ways of removing a constraint, some of which may be politically much more feasible

than others. Finally, the nature of the binding constraint will change over time, requiring a

change in focus as well. Best-practice institutions are, almost by definition, non-contextual and

do not take account these complications. Insofar as they narrow rather than expand the menu of

institutional choices available to reformers, they serve the cause badly.
