Conceptual Revolutions in Twentieth-Century Art
David Galenson
NBER Working Paper No. 15073
June 2009
JEL No. Z1,Z11

                                              ABSTRACT

Art critics and scholars have acknowledged the breakdown of their explanations and narratives of
contemporary art in the face of what they consider the incoherent era of “pluralism” or “postmodernism”
that began in the late twentieth century. This failure is in fact a result of their inability to understand
the nature of the development of advanced art throughout the entire twentieth century, and particularly
the novel behavior of young conceptual innovators in a new market environment. The rise of a competitive
market for advanced art in the late nineteenth century freed artists from the constraint of having to
satisfy powerful patrons, and gave them unprecedented freedom to innovate. As the rewards for radical
and conspicuous innovation increased, conceptual artists could respond to these incentives more quickly
and decisively than their experimental counterparts. Early in the twentieth century, the young conceptual
genius Pablo Picasso initiated two new practices, by alternating styles at will and inventing a new
artistic genre, that became basic elements of the art of a series of later conceptual innovators. By the
late twentieth century, extensions of these practices had led to the emergence of important individual
artists whose work appeared to have no unified style, and to the balkanization of advanced art, as the
dominance of painting gave way before novel uses of old genres and the creation of many new ones.
Understanding not only contemporary art, but the art of the past century as a whole, will require art
scholars to abandon their outmoded insistence on analyzing art in terms of style, and to recognize the
many novel patterns of behavior that have been created over the course of the past century by young
conceptual innovators.

Pluralism, Postmodernism, and Perplexed Art Pundits

               Painters no longer live within a tradition and so each of us must
               recreate an entire language.
                                                                     Pablo Picasso1

               Well, thank God, art tends to be less what critics write than what
               artists make.
                                                                     Jasper Johns2

       In 2005, Peter Schjeldahl wrote in the New Yorker that “The contemporary art world of

the 1980s blew apart into four main fragments … Eventually, even the fragments disintegrated,

becoming the sluggish mishmash that has prevailed in art ever since.”3 The idea that advanced

art had become fragmented in the late twentieth century was not a new one. In 1984, for

example, the art historian Corinne Robins titled her survey of American art during 1968-1981

The Pluralist Era, and on the first page observed that “the Pluralism of the seventies …

effectively did away with the idea of dominant styles for at least a decade.”4 Over time, another

term gained currency to describe the situation, as in 2000 Jonathan Fineberg explained in his

textbook, Art Since 1940, that what had emerged in the seventies was postmodernism, “an

inclusive aesthetic that cultivates the variety of incoherence.”5

       Whatever name they give to the situation, there is widespread agreement among art

critics and scholars that they have lost the ability to provide any convincing overall narrative or

explanation for the art of the late twentieth century and beyond. The critic Arthur Danto, for

example, remarked in 1997 that “contemporary art no longer allows itself to be represented by

master narratives at all.”6 One of the most remarkable admissions was made in 2004 by Hal

Foster of Princeton University. On p. 679 of Art Since 1900 – the final page of a textbook that he

co-authored with Rosalind Krauss of Columbia, Yve-Alain Bois of Harvard, and Benjamin
                                                   4


Buchloh of Columbia – Foster raised “a question we haven’t confronted,” and reflected as

follows:

                Are there plausible ways to narrate the now myriad practices of
                contemporary art over the last twenty years at least? I don’t point
                to this period of time arbitrarily: in the last several years the two
                primary models we’ve used to articulate different aspects of
                postwar art have become dysfunctional. I mean, on the one hand,
                the model of a medium-specific modernism challenged by an
                interdisciplinary postmodernism, and, on the other, the model of a
                historical avant-garde (i.e. ones critical of the old bourgeois
                institution of art such as Dada and Constructivism) and a neo-
                avant-garde that elaborates on this critique … Today the recursive
                strategy of the “neo” appears as attenuated as the oppositional
                logic of the “post” seems tired: neither suffices as a strong
                paradigm for artistic or cultural practice, and no other model stands
                in their stead; or, put differently, many local models compete, but
                none can hope to be paradigmatic. And we should note too that the
                methods discussed again here – psychoanalysis, Marxian social
                history, structuralism, and poststructuralism – are hardly thriving.

        Foster’s statement is startling, for it is no less than a declaration by a leading art scholar,

made with the approval of three peers, that no existing analysis can account for the art of recent

decades. The interest of this conundrum is heightened by the fact that – as Foster immediately

proceeded to observe – contemporary art is thriving in the marketplace.7

        What the art experts have consistently failed to recognize is that what they call pluralism

or postmodernism did not arise spontaneously in the late twentieth century, but was instead a

logical – indeed, systematic – extension of practices that originated at the beginning of the

twentieth century, and that developed throughout the decades that followed. This paper will

present a new explanation for the nature of contemporary art, based on the proposition that it is

largely the consistent product of a specific type of artistic creativity, operating in a particular

market environment.

The Two Faces of Artistic Creativity

               Does creation reside in the idea or in the action?
                                                                    Sir Alan Bowness8

               Probably the most major piece I’m ever going to make in my
               lifetime I made right at the beginning.
                                                                 Damien Hirst9

       Important artists are innovators. They can be divided into two types, on the basis of

differences in their goals, methods, and achievements.

       Experimental innovators seek to record visual perceptions. Their goals are imprecise, so

they proceed tentatively, by trial and error. The imprecision of their goals rarely allows them to

feel that they have succeeded, and they often spend their careers pursuing a single objective.

They consider making art a process of searching, in which they want to discover images in the

course of making them. They build their skills gradually, and their innovations emerge piecemeal

in a body of work.

       Conceptual innovators express ideas or emotions. Their goals can be stated precisely, so

they usually plan their works, and execute them systematically. Their innovations are

conspicuous, transgressive, and often irreverent. Their innovations appear suddenly, as a new

idea produces a result quite different not only from other artists’ work, but also from their own

previous work.

       The long periods of trial and error typically required for important experimental

innovations means that they tend to occur late in an artist’s life. Radical conceptual innovations

depend on the ability to recognize the potential gains from extreme deviations from existing

conventions, and this ability declines with experience, as habits of thought become fixed. The

most important conceptual innovations consequently occur early in an artist’s career.10

       Both experimental and conceptual innovators have played on important role throughout

the history of western art. So for example the Old Masters Jan van Eyck, Masaccio, Giorgione,
                                                    6


Raphael, Caravaggio, and Vermeer were great conceptual innovators, while Leonardo,

Michelangelo, Titian, Hals, Velazquez, and Rembrandt were great experimental innovators.11

The conceptual innovators Courbet, Manet, Gauguin, and van Gogh were among the greatest

artists of the nineteenth century, as were the experimental innovators Degas, Cézanne, Monet,

and Renoir.12 For centuries, neither type of innovator dominated advanced art. This changed,

however, in the twentieth century, as conceptual innovators gained an advantage over their

experimental counterparts. This advantage stemmed from a change in the structure of the market

for advanced art.

The Rise of a Competitive Market for Art

               Painting has lost a lot of the functions that once used to provide
               discipline and continuity. I mean commissioned art, from
               portraiture to whatever, which only incidentally gave painters the
               chance to make art. Nowadays they can’t do anything but make art.
               That alters a lot.
                                                                   Gerhard Richter13

               The market is the greatest critic.
                                                                        Jeff Koons14

       During the late nineteenth century, a momentous change in the market for art set the stage

for an unprecedented era of revolutionary artistic change. In 1874, frustrated at their lack of

success in having their paintings accepted and displayed at the official Salon, the annual or

biennial exhibition operated by the Academy of Fine Arts, Claude Monet and a group of his

friends organized an independent exhibition that included paintings by 29 artists. Although its

full significance would not become apparent until much later, the first Impressionist exhibition

began a new era, in which the reputations of important advanced artists would no longer be

created in the Salon, but would instead be made in independent group exhibitions. The most

important of these would be the eight Impressionist exhibitions held during 1874-86, and the
                                                   7


Salon des Indépendants, which was held annually from 1884 on. Analytically, the critical change

that the Impressionists initiated in 1874 was the elimination of the official Salon’s monopoly of

the ability to present fine art in a setting that critics and the public would accept as legitimate.

The Salon consequently would no longer determine whether an aspiring artist could have a

successful career.15

        A competitive market for advanced art did not immediately come into existence,

however, because of the slow emergence of private galleries that were willing to sell the work of

younger artists: it was not until the early twentieth century that the number of independent

entrepreneurial galleries would grow large enough to create a genuinely competitive market.16

The increase in these galleries reflected the growing awareness of the potential gains from

investing in innovative art, as the prices of work not only by Monet and the other Impressionists

but also by the Post-Impressionists Cézanne, van Gogh, and Gauguin began to increase during

the 1890s. By 1910, the leading critic of the advanced art world, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire,

observed that “The plethora of individual exhibitions tends to weaken the effect of the large

annual salons. The public is less keen, since many painters have already shown in the galleries

the most important, if not the best, examples of their work during the year.”17 Over time, private

galleries would replace group exhibitions altogether as the key exhibition places for new

advanced art, not only in Paris, but also in other art centers.

        The first artist to rise to prominence by exhibiting in galleries rather than group shows

was Pablo Picasso. Early in his career, Picasso used his art to cultivate merchants in the art

market who could sell his work and spread his reputation. It is possible that no artist has painted

more different dealers: during his first two decades in Paris, Picasso executed portraits of no less

than nine dealers, and the wife of a tenth.18 The effect was telling. When the Italian painter
                                                  8


Umberto Boccioni visited Paris in 1911, he reported to a friend that “The young man ruling the

roost here now is Picasso… [T]he painter scarcely finishes a work before it is carted off and paid

for by the dealers in competition with each other.”19 Picasso’s portraits of Ambroise Vollard,

Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Paul Rosenberg, and a succession of other gallery owners stand today

as powerful visual evidence of the birth of a new regime in the history of art markets, that in turn

created a new era of artistic freedom.

       The story of the Impressionists’ challenge to the official Salon has long been a staple in

narratives of art history, but art scholars have never fully appreciated the significance of the

changes it initiated. Innovation had always been the hallmark of important art, but from the

Renaissance on nearly all artists were constrained in the extent to which they could innovate by

the need to satisfy powerful individual patrons or institutions. The overthrow of the Salon

monopoly of the art market in Paris started a process that led to the creation of a competitive

market for the innovative work of advanced artists. This removed the constraint of patronage,

and gave artists a greater freedom to innovate. Perhaps not surprisingly, the first great artist to

take real advantage of competition among dealers was the greatest of the young conceptual

innovators of the new era.

The Dematerialization of Style

               Picasso in each one of his facets, has made clear his intention to
               keep free from preceding achievements.
                                                                Marcel Duchamp20

               How can you say one style is better than another? You should be
               able to be an Abstract Expressionist next week, or a Pop artist, or a
               realist, without feeling you’ve given up something.
                                                                    Andy Warhol21

               I’ve never been able to stick to one thing.
                                                                     Bruce Nauman22
                                                  9


       In 1985, the eminent art historian Meyer Schapiro observed that “If the works of Pablo

Picasso were not identified directly with his name, if they were shown together in a big

exhibition, it would be rather difficult to say they were the work of one man.”23 In 1996, the art

historian David Campbell observed that “visiting a [Sigmar] Polke exhibition is often like

wandering around a group show.”24 And in 2002, the critic Arthur Danto observed that “when I

first saw a retrospective of [Gerhard] Richter’s work … it looked like I was seeing some kind of

group show.”25

       It is striking that three different authors used precisely the same metaphor to describe

their bewilderment at the stylistic versatility of three different painters. Yet each made this

observation in isolation, without recognizing the common element in the practices of the artists

in question. Nor are these three artists the only ones who have prompted this reaction. So for

example the artist William Anastasi recalled that what had struck him when he first saw the

Arensberg collection at the Philadelphia Museum was “that every Duchamp was so completely

different from every other Duchamp.”26 In 1949, in a tribute to his old friend Francis Picabia,

Marcel Duchamp described Picabia’s career as “a kaleidoscopic series of art experiences …

hardly related to one another in their external appearances.”27 The painter and photographer Man

Ray, a friend of both Duchamp and Picabia, explained that he made sudden changes in the style

of his work because “I enjoyed contradicting myself.”28

       The practice of stylistic versatility is a pattern, that has been followed by a series of

important artists of the past century. It is a practice that has been consciously learned by these

artists, from the examples of their predecessors. Bruce Nauman’s art, for instance, is so varied in

form that Peter Schjeldahl declared in 2002 that “There is no Nauman style.”29 Nauman has

explained that early in his career he was influenced by a retrospective exhibition of the work of
                                                  10


Man Ray: “What I liked was that there appeared to be no consistency to his thinking, no one

style.”30 And Gerhard Richter observed in 1977 that “changeable artists are a growing

phenomenon. Picasso, for instance, or Duchamp and Picabia – and the number is certainly

increasing all the time.”31

        Throughout the twentieth century, a succession of important artists – including, for

example, not only Picasso, Duchamp, Picabia, Richter, Polke, and Nauman, but also Max Ernst,

Richard Hamilton, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Jeff Koons, Damien

Hirst, and Tracey Emin – have changed styles frequently and at will. This practice has been a

novel feature of twentieth-century art, that was initiated by Picasso. Thus in 1996 the eminent

English critic David Sylvester reflected that “Picasso is a kind of artist who couldn’t have existed

before this century, since his art is a celebration of this century’s introduction of a totally

promiscuous eclecticism into the practice of art.”32

        Style had traditionally been regarded as the essential signature of the artist, but Picasso

considered it instead to be merely a means of expression: “Whenever I had something to say, I

have said it in the manner in which I have felt it ought to be said.” This attitude implied that he

could change styles as the need arose: “Different motives inevitably require different methods of

expression.”33 Instead of treating style as the artist’s personal hallmark, and as something to be

painstakingly crafted, Picasso had created a radical new conceptual approach that reduced style

to a convenient means of making a specific statement. In this new formulation, the artist could

introduce new styles at will, or alternate between existing styles, as a matter of convenience. This

was a powerful new conception of style, that could readily be adopted by other conceptual

artists. Thus Duchamp paid tribute to Picasso for representing “the living expression of a new

thought in the realm of esthetics… This will be Picasso’s main contribution to art. To have been
                                                 11


able to start from a new source, and to keep this freshness with regard to whatever new

expressions mark the different epochs of his career.”34

       It was not long before other artists followed Picasso’s lead. Duchamp adopted an even

more extreme position, in an attempt to eliminate style altogether. His introduction of the

readymade was one manifestation of his desire to abolish taste, which he considered to be a

product of repetition.35 Avoiding repetition would consequently eliminate taste, and incidentally

style, so Duchamp’s goal was to make just one work for each idea: “I’ve had thirty-three ideas;

I’ve made thirty-three paintings.”36 Duchamp’s friend Picabia shared his belief in frequent

change, declaring that “If you want to have clean ideas, change them as often as you change your

shirts.”37 Dada became the first artistic group that effectively made the elimination of style a

collective goal, as the painter Hans Richter explained that the movement aimed at “riot,

destruction, defiance, confusion. The role of chance, not as an extension of the scope of art, but

as a principle of dissolution and anarchy.”38 Picasso, Duchamp, Picabia, and the Dadas created a

legacy that reverberated throughout advanced art in the generations that followed. Following

their examples, artists could consider style not as a goal, but as a strategy, and if they wished,

they could dispense with it altogether.

       One key characteristic unifies all the versatile artistic innovators of the twentieth century,

from Picasso and Duchamp through Hirst and Emin: all are conceptual artists. Their behavior in

changing styles made their careers differ radically from those of experimental artists. For the

century’s great experimental innovators, from Mondrian and Kandinsky through Pollock and

Rothko and beyond, art remained a lifelong quest along a single path toward the one true

personal style. Their styles evolved over time, slowly and gradually. Even late in the century, the

experimental painter Brice Marden explained that he was inspired by Cézanne’s “intense, long,
                                                   12


slow process of working, looking, assimilating,” and the experimental sculptor Louise Bourgeois

reflected that her style had been hard won: “My style, the way I work comes from all the failures,

all the temptations I have resisted, all the fun I didn’t have, all the regrets.”39

        The protean innovator is a radical conceptual creation of the twentieth century, and as

Gerhard Richter recognized, its importance has increased over time. By the end of the twentieth

century, many of the central figures in advanced art, including Rauschenberg, Richter, Koons,

Hirst, and Emin, were conceptual contributors to the dematerialization of style. Thus for example

Richter could reflect in 1984 that “It has now become my identifying characteristic that my work

is all over the place.”40

The Balkanization of Advanced Art

                What is sculpture? What is painting? Everyone’s still clinging to
                outdated ideas, obsolete definitions, as if the artist’s role was not
                precisely to offer new ones.
                                                                        Pablo Picasso41

                Art used to mean paintings and statues. Now it means practically
                anything human-made that is unclassifiable otherwise.
                                                                Peter Schjeldahl42

        The pluralism of the late twentieth century was not solely the product of the

dematerialization of style, for it was also caused by another powerful trend that had also been

active throughout nearly the entire century, that was also initiated by Picasso. This trend affected

not only the appearance of art, but its very substance.

        In 1912, Picasso glued a piece of oil cloth to a small oval painting. Still Life with Chair

Caning became one of the most important works of art of the twentieth century, for it was the

first collage – “the first painting in which extraneous objects or materials are applied to the

picture surface.” Collage violated a tradition that had been honored by artists since the

Renaissance, that nothing other than paint should be placed on the two-dimensional surface of
                                                 13


the support, and John Golding observed that “The aesthetic implications of collage as a whole

were vast.”43 Yet the implications of collage went far beyond the aesthetic, for when he invented

a new genre, Picasso set in motion a process that would make the art of the twentieth century

fundamentally different in form from that of all earlier centuries.

       Collage was an archetypal conceptual innovation, for it broke the rules of an existing art

form so decisively that it was immediately recognized as a new genre. And its example quickly

inspired other conceptual innovators. Before 1912 was out, Picasso’s fellow Cubist Georges

Braque had made the first papier collé. In 1913, after a visit to Picasso’s studio, the Russian artist

Vladimir Tatlin made the first counter-relief. Also in 1913, Marcel Duchamp made the first

readymade.

       And on and on. During the twentieth century, at least four dozen new artistic genres were

invented, virtually all by conceptual innovators.44 These were not all of equal importance: many

gained few followers, and some remained the exclusive domain of their inventors. Yet some rose

to great prominence, and a key result of this proliferation of genres was that over the course of

the twentieth century the world of advanced art became balkanized. This process was at work

throughout the century, but during the first half of the century two world wars and a great

depression appear to have restricted its progress by limiting the market for new art. In contrast,

the prosperity of the 1960s and after, which created a strong demand for innovative art, provided

the basis for the widespread adoption of new genres by ambitious young artists. At the beginning

of the twentieth century, important artists were either painters or sculptors. In contrast, by the

century’s end, painters and sculptors had been joined by sizeable numbers of artists who devoted

themselves to such other genres as collage, installation, photography, and video.
                                                   14


        And the real extent of balkanization is even greater than a listing of active genres implies,

for in many cases in which recent artists have not given new names to their innovative practices,

they have nevertheless radically expanded the boundaries of existing genres. It is highly unlikely,

for example, that Rodin or Brancusi would recognize as sculpture many of the recent works that

are given that label. Arthur Danto noticed this: “some of the most interesting artists of the middle

to late sixties – Bruce Nauman, Robert Morris, Robert Irwin, Eva Hesse – began as painters, but

found painting constraining. It is not as though they turned to sculpture as such, for the

connotation of sculpture would have been no less constraining at the time. All that the work of

these artists had in common with sculpture was a real third dimension, which somehow seems of

marginal relevance, the way it is undeniable but also irrelevant that dance is three-

dimensional.”45 Robert Smithson was another artist of the ‘60s who began as a painter but soon

turned to sculpture, and in the process exploded that genre’s traditional boundaries. In 1967 he

observed that the conventional division of art into painting, architecture, and sculpture had been

unfortunate, and added that “Now all these categories are splintering into more and more

categories, and it’s like an interminable avalanche of categories.”46

        One important tendency of balkanization has been to limit the importance of individual

artists. In art, as in other intellectual activities, importance is a function of influence, and

balkanization has tended to limit the sphere of influence of artists. Until recently, a painter could

influence nearly all advanced artists, so Picasso, Pollock, or Warhol could be dominant figures in

the entire art world. Today it is more difficult for any one artist to reach all these groups. This

trend away from dominant individual artists is heightened by the nature of conceptual artists’ life

cycles, for many radical young innovators have failed to make any later significant

contributions.47

A Conceptual World

               I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.
                                                                     Pablo Picasso48

               I wanted to put painting once again at the service of the mind.
                                                                Marcel Duchamp49

       In 2001, Arthur Danto declared that “We are living in a conceptual art world.”50 The

observation was accurate, but tardy. The conceptual art world of the late twentieth century

developed clearly and directly from the earlier conceptual innovations of Picasso, Duchamp, and

their many heirs. Art scholars’ failure to understand this process has led to their inability to make

sense of contemporary art.

       Art scholars invariably approach the history of art as the analysis of styles. This left them

helpless when style dematerialized in the work of many artists late in the twentieth century. Art

scholars don’t understand that style was one casualty of the conceptual revolutions in twentieth-

century art. Art scholars have long stubbornly refused to recognize the fundamental role of

markets and economic incentives in the production of advanced art. They have also resisted

systematic analysis of artists’ differing approaches to creativity. Yet adopting these analytical

tools is essential to an understanding of the nature of contemporary art. Conceptual and

experimental artists had coexisted throughout the entire history of western art, but the constraints

imposed by patronage had the effect of making it possible for scholars to treat their works as

comparable products for the period prior to the modern era. With the rise of a competitive market

for advanced art, the rewards for radical innovation increased, conceptual artists could respond to

these incentives more quickly and decisively than their experimental counterparts, and their work

diverged more conspicuously from that of their experimental contemporaries. Art scholars must
                                                 16


embrace new analytical methods if they are to recognize these patterns, and understand how and

why the past century was genuinely an age of revolutionary conceptual artistic change.

And Now for Something Completely Different

               Another important value of the modern artist is that his art is
               completely free. There are no rules, no hierarchy of privileged
               qualities, no absolute standards, characteristics, or codified
               methods, and there are no privileged materials.
                                                                    Meyer Schapiro51

               Art is invention, exciting and fantastic … When someone tells me I
               can’t do something, so far I’ve always found out that I can.
                                                                   Damien Hirst52

       During the twentieth century conceptual innovators began regularly to make rapid

changes of style, and to create works that intentionally violated the boundaries of traditional

artistic genres. But the creativity of conceptual innovators has not been limited to these activities,

for they have also engaged in a series of other behaviors that are novel within the context of all

earlier art history. Thus they have intentionally provoked observers to ponder the question of

whether their work is serious or a joke; they have had their work executed entirely by others,

thereby highlighting the conceptual nature of their involvement; they have consistently co-

authored their work; they have greatly extended the use of language in art, and in some instances

have made art wholly out of language; they have created personal art, making their art entirely

out of their own lives; and they have openly embraced the market, and cited the high prices of

their work as evidence of their success. 53

       These are all significant features of twentieth-century art: they are patterns, created by

systematic artistic behavior. Yet these patterns, and their effects, have been largely overlooked

by art scholars, for they do not involve style, and their identification requires systematic

generalization. In 1933, Roger Fry appealed to his fellow art scholars, pleading that “we have
                                                 17


such a crying need for systematic study in which scientific methods will be followed wherever

possible, where at all events the scientific attitude may be fostered and the sentimental attitude

discouraged.”54 Art historians ignored Fry’s appeal then. If they continue to do so, the cost will

be not only a continuing inability to understand contemporary advanced art, but also an inability

to understand the art of the twentieth century as a whole.
