    This paper makes contributions to the estimation of health production

functions and the economics of fertility control. We present the first

infant health production functions that simultaneously control for self-

selection in the resolution of pregnancies as live births or induced abor-

tions and in the use of prenatal medical care services. We also incorporate

the decision of a pregnant woman to give birth or obtain an abortion into

economic models of fertility control and use information conveyed by this

decision to refine estimates of infant health production functions and

demand functions for prenatal medical care.

    This paper makes contributions to two areas of investigation within the

context of the household production function approach to consumer behavior

(Becker 1965; Michael and Decker 1973): the estimation of health production

functions and the economics of fertility control. In the former area we

present the first infant health production functions that simultaneously

control for self—selection (correlations between unobserved variables and

observed outcomes) in the resolution of pregnancies as live births or

induced abortions and in the use of prenatal medical care services. In the

latter area we incorporate the decision of a pregnant woman to give birth

or obtain an abortion into economic models of fertility control and use

information conveyed by this decision to refine estimates of infant health

production functions and demand functions for prenatal medical care.

    The concept of a health production function, originally developed by

Grossman (1972), has been widely accepted and fruitfully applied. Yet,

until recently, researchers have tended to emphasize reduced form as

opposed to structural estimates. The reasoning was clear. Unobserved

biological factors such as an individual's exogenous health endowment and

hard-to—measure endogenous inputs such as nutrition, exercise, and the

avoidance of stress can play major roles in the determination of health

outcomes.   If an individual's behavior is shaped in part by knowledge of

his or her endowment or if the unmeasured endogenous inputs are correlated

with the included inputs, then estimates of the health technology will be

biased.

    Recent work on the economic analysis of infant health (measured by
                                    —2—


birthweight or survival) by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1963a, 1983b,

forthcoming a, forthcoming b); Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1997); and

Joyce (1967) has emphasi2ed structural estimates of the health technology.

In these studies two—stage least squares has been applied to control for

the adverse selection of health inputs. In particular, Rosenzweig and

Schultz have argued that women who anticipate a problematic birth based on

conditions unknown to the researcher seek out more remedial care while

women with positive expectations seek out less. Consequently, the asso-

ciation between such variables as early prenatal medical care and birth—

weight is understated when measured by direct correlation measures.

    Adverse selection in input use is, however, only one source of bias.

In the epidemiological literature researchers have argued that favorable

selection may be a more serious source of confounding (Gortmaker 1979;

Institute of Medicine 1965). The efficacy of prenatal care, for example,

may be seriously overstated if early care is but one form of healthy beha-

vior. Pregnant women who initiate care promptly may eat more nutritiously,

suffer less stress, engage in the appropriate exercise, and use less drugs

and other potentially harmful substances than women who begin care late.

The omission of these hard—to-measure inputs tends to overestimate the

impact of early prenatal care on birthweight.

   Moreover, the resolution of a pregnancy itself may be characterized by

self—selection. With regard to this outcome, selection is favorable if

women whose fetuses have poor health endowments are more likely to obtain

an abortion or if women who desire to make relatively large investments in

their infants are more likely to give birth. On the other hand, selection
                                    —3—

is adverse if women who make relatively small investments are more likely

to give birth.

    The use of an instrumental variable approach to correct for self—

selection in input use presupposes that this decision is characterized by

adverse selection1 and ignores the problem of self—selection in the resolu-

tion of pregnancies. In this paper we approach the problem differently and

somewhat more generally. Following Heckman (1979), we treat the estimation

of infant health production functions and prenatal medical care demand

functions as a general problem in self-selection. Specifically, we test

whether women who give birth represent a random draw from the population of

women who become pregnant. The widespread use of induced abortion since

its legalization by the Supreme Court in 1973 has permitted much greater

choice in the number and timing of births. In the United States in 1983.

30 percent of all pregnancies (live births plus induced abortions) were

terminated by induced abortions (Bureau of the Census 1986). Thus, the

extent to which a failure to incorporate the choice-based nature of micro

vital records into estimates of infant health production functions may bias

the parameters of this function is potentially large. It is our specific

hypothesis that the unobserved factors that impact on the decision to give

birth not only affect pregnancy outcomes but also condition the behavior of

women who choose to give birth during pregnancy as well.

    Our study is based on a cohort of pregnant women in New York City in

1984. In that year 45 percent of all pregnancies to New York City residents

ended in induced abortions. We estimate a three equation model. The first

equation is the probability of giving birth, given that a woman is pregnant.
                                       —4-

With this as our criteria equation, we test for self—selection in the infant

health (measured by birthweight) production function and in the prenatal medi-

cal care demand function. Empirically, our estimates differ from those

obtained by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983b, forthcoming a, forthcoming b)

because they use micro vital records on live births alone. Not only does our

methodology obviate the need to assert a priori whether adverse or favorable

selection is dominant, but the sign pattern of the residual covariances indica-

tes which type of selection characterizes both the decision to give birth and

the decision to initiate prenatal care promptly.

    Since our framework includes an implicit equation for the probability

of becoming pregnant, we incorporate induced abortion as an alternative to

traditional methods of contraception into economic models of fertility

control (for example. Michael and Willis 1975; Heckman and Willis 1975;

Hotz and Miller 1988).2 These models emphasize the use of contraception to

reduce the uncertainty associated with the number and timing of births.

Induced abortion eliminates much of this uncertainty at a positive price.

By assuming that the prices of contraception and abortion have unmeasured

components that vary among women, we enrich the theoretical literature on

the optimal number and quality of children (for example. Becker and Lewis

1973; Willis 1973) and gain a better understanding of the earliest indica-

tor of child quality -—   infant   health -— and the resources allocated to its

production. In particular, we show that the prices of contraception and

abortion, as well as the health endowment of the fetus, simultaneously

influence decisions with regard to pregnancy resolutions and input selec-

tion.

                          I. Analytical Framework

    Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983a, 1983b, forthcoming a, forthcoming

b); Corman and Grossman (1985); Corman, Joyce. and Grossman (1987); and.

Joyce (1987) have generated and estimated birth outcome production func-

tions and input and output demand functions for infant health in the con-

text of a static economic model of the family and household production. It

is assumed that the parents' utility function (or the mother's utility

function in families with no father) depends on their own consumption, the

number of births, and the survival probability of each birth (which does

not vary among births in a given family). The last variable is governed to

a large extent by birthweight. Both the number of births and the outcome

of each birth are endogenous variables. In particular, the birthweight

production function depends upon endogenous inputs including the quantity

and quality of medical care, the own time of the mother, and such healthy

behaviors as proper diet, appropriate exercise, and the avoidance of

stress. In addition, the production function is affected by the reproduc-

tive efficiency of the mother, including the unobserved biologically

endowed probability that her infant will survive the first month of life,

and other aspects of her efficiency in household production.

    Maximization of the utility function subject to production and resource

constraints generates a demand function for birthweight in which this out-

come is related to input prices (whose indirect cost components are negati-

vely related to input availability), efficiency, income, and tastes. The

interaction between the birthweight demand and production functions deter-

mines demand functions for prenatal care and other endogenous inputs. These
                                     —6-

 demand functions depend on the same set of variables as the demand function

 for birthweight.

     To introduce the decision of a pregnant woman to give birth or obtain

 an abortion into the above model, note that a dynamic version of it implies

 an optimal number of children for the 1th woman in year t(Ct). If C is

 the actual number of children that a pregnant woman will have in year t in

 the absence of an abortion (parity plus one), then she will give birth

 provided 1Tt= C'—        0 and will abort provided lritc .

     Equations for the probability of a birth (it1), the production function

of birthweight (b1), and the demand for prenatal medical care       (mi) now can

be specified. For convenience, the time subscripts and the intercepts are

suppressed. The birth probability function is assumed to be linear,

although later a probit specification will be used. The three equations are

         Jr= aiz÷ u1. u1 = a2c1+ a3a+ a4e1                    (1)

         b= 1x.+ $2m.+ u21, u2. = $3q.+    $4e                (2)

         m1=         u3   u3 = Y2c+ v3aF y4e1.                (3)


     In this system of equations, z1 x, vi. ci, a, and e1, denote exoge-

nous variables or vectors of variables. For instance, in the birth proba-

bility equation (14. z stands for such determinants of the optimal number

of children and the spacing of births as family income, mother's education,

and marital status. In the same equation c is the cost of contraception,

which is directly related to money price and indirectly related to availa-

bility and to contraceptive efficiency or knowledge. This cost also has a

psychic component due to joint production (Grossman 1971; Michael 1.973;

Pollack and Wachter 1975): an increase in contraceptive use lowers the
                                    —7—


probability of becoming pregnant but may also reduce the gratification

yielded by sexual intercourse. The variable ai gives the direct, indirect,

and psychic costs of obtaining an abortion. The latter cost component

should be higher for Catholics than for non—Catholics. The variable e1

measures the health endowment of the fetus.

    Examples of members of the x vector in the birthweight production

function (2) and of the y vector in the prenatal care demand function (3)

are given in Section II. The roles of the uji(J=1.2.3). which are linear

functions of c, a1, and e, are discussed below. In addition to prenatal

care, the birthweight production function contains another endogenous input

(q). which reflects such healthy behaviors as proper diet, appropriate

exercise, and the avoidance of stress. The model includes an unspecified

demand function for healthy behaviors that has the sane arguments as the

demand function for prenatal medical care. Finally, each of the three

equations contains an unspecified random disturbance term.

     A reduction in the price of contraception is expected to raise the

probability of giving birth (a2< 0). while an increase in the price of

abortion is expected to raise this probability (a3> 0). The basic force

that generates these predictions is an implicit equation for the probabi-

lity of becoming pregnant. Under the plausible assumption that contracep-

tion and abortion are alternative methods of birth control, a rise in the

price of contraception or a decline in the price of abortion raises this

probability. As these propositions imply, pregnancies to women with low

costs of averting them (low contraceptive costs) may be termed "wanted"

pregnancies.   It also follows that a fall in the cost of contraception or
                                    —8-

 abortion raises the quantity of prenatal care (2 < 0, 73 < 0) and raises

 the level of the healthy behavior input. The force at work here is that a

 reduction in the cost of averting a pregnancy or a birth lowers the optimal

 number of children and raises the optimal amount of resources allocated to

each birth (Becker and Lewis 1973; Willis 1973). This is another sense in

which a reduction in the price of averting a birth raises the level of wan-

tedness.

     It is very likely that women whose potential or actual fetuses have

favorable health endowments demand a larger optimal number of children and

are more likely to choose to give birth than women with unfavorable

endowments (a4> 0). Moreover, the coefficients of the endowment in the

demand functions for prenatal care (y4) and the healthy behavior are nega-

tive because of a reallocation of resources away from infant health induced

by a better endowment.3


     Given measures of the price of contraception, the price of abortion,

the health endowment of the fetus, and the healthy behavior input, one

could quantify the above effects precisely and also obtain an estimate of

the coefficient of prenatal care in the birthweight production function

($2) that controls for the endowment and healthy behaviors. Since these

variables are not observed or measured imperfectly, this is not possible.

Nevertheless, it still is possible to shed considerable light on their

roles in reproductive outcomes. The basic idea is to include their levels

and effects in the disturbance term in each equation (Uji) and then obtain

estimates of the covariances between disturbance terms across equations.4

     To be specific, assume that u(J =   1,2,3)   has a zero mean, and denote
                                                —9-.


the three pairwise covariances between the disturbance terms as °12 ia

and a23. Then

                                                                                (4)
            °12 a4$4a + C2$30qc+ a3830qa

                                                                                (5)
            a13= a4y4a + a2y2a + a3y3a

                                                                                (6)
            023= 844e + 832qc + 33°qa'
where aj(j =     e,c,a)    is the variance of variable J and aqj(J =                  c,a)   is the

covariance between q and j.             It   is assumed that e, c, and a are mutually

uncorrelated and that q does not depend on e.                       (The conclusions reached are

not sensitive to the lack of these relationships.) Recall that a3 and a4

are positive, while 72' Y. 74. 0qc' and °qa are negative. Moreover, 8

and 84 are positive since an increase in the healthy behavior input or an

increase in the health endowment of the fetus raises birthweight.

       The sign patterns of the covariances identify whether the health

endowment of the fetus, the cost of contraception, or the cost of abortion

is the dominant unmeasured determinant of reproductive outcomes. For

instance, suppose that the prices of abortion and contraception do not vary

(a =    a=          = 0qa =    0).     Then a12 is positive, while a13 and a23 are

negative. That is, an increase in the health endowment raises the proba-

bility of giving birth and birthweight (u11 and U2i increase), while it

lowers the quantity of prenatal care demanded (U3i declines). Now suppose

that there is no variation in the price of abortion or in the health

endowment. Then each covariance is positive. A reduction in the cost of

contraception makes a birth more likely (Ui rises), causes the healthy

behavior input and therefore birthweight to expand (u2i rises), and causes
                                      — 10   —




 the   quantity of prenatal care to grow (u3i rises). Finally, if the price

 of abortion alone varies, a12 and a13 are negative, while a23 is positive.

        The health endowment model (no variation in c or a) is the one empha-

 sized by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983a, 1983b, forthcoming a, forth-

 coming b) and by us in our previous research (Corman, Joyce, and Grossman

 1981; Joyce 19B1). It may be termed a model with adverse selection in

 input use because women who demand relatively large amounts of prenatal

care have poor endowments. It also is a model with favorable selection in

pregnancy resolution because women with relatively good endowments are more

likely to give birth. The cost of contraception model (no variation in a

or e) and the cost of abortion model (no variation in c or e) reflect

favorable selection in input use because prenatal care and healthy beha-

viors are positively related. The cost of contraception model is charac-

terized by favorable selection in pregnancy resolution because women with

larger optimal values of m and q are more likely to give birth. The

reverse holds in the cost of abortion model.5 A unique sign pattern

emerges in each model, which permits one to identify the relevant one.

Moreover, identification is based solely on the signs of   a12 and 0j3, which

is important because the procedure described below yields direct estimates

of these two parameters.

       When all three determinants vary, the sign of a given covariance is

ambiguous. But their sign patterns still identify the dominant factor.6

To summarize, the estimation of the model specified here and the pairwise

covariances between its disturbance terms shed light on the qualitative and

quantitative importance of hard-to-measure determinants of birth outcomes.
                                   — 11 —




     To be sure, some caution should be exercised in giving names to

unmeasured variables. For example, the predictions made by the cost of

contraception model are identical to those in a model in which women who

make relatively large investments in their children are more likely to give

birth for whatever reason. Indeed, the concept of 'wantedness," which is

emphasized by demographers and sociologists, is placed in an economic con-

text and 9iven an economic interpretation, by the cost of contraception

model.

     Moreover, other economic models can generate the same predictions as a

sociological model of wantedness. For example, suppose that the price of

the healthy behavior input (q1) varies among women. Even if the money

price of this input is the same for everyone, the time price may differ as

a function of wage rates and the inconvenience costs of meal preparation

and exercise. The ability of pregnant women to avoid stressful situations

may depend on the nature of their jobs and family circumstances. Differences

in the knowledge or perception of the health benefits of this input also

generate differences in its 'shadow price." The same effect can be attri-

buted to joint production since the healthy behavior input may be a direct

source of utility (or disutility) as well as an input into infant health.

Hence the shadow price of q as an infant health input depends in part on

the monetary value of its direct marginal utility or disutility, which may

vary among women.7

     Let us introduce the shadow price (p) of the healthy behavior input as

an additional unobservable in the birth probability equation (1) and the

prenatal care demand function (3). Clearly1 a reduction in p raises the
                                     — 12   —




 quantity   of the healthy behavior input demanded. In addition, assume that

 it raises the birth probability, either because the optimal number of

 children as well as their optimal health rises or because the probability

 of becoming pregnant falls.0 Finally, note that the sign of p In the

 demand function for prenatal care is ambiguous. It is negative if m and q

 are complements and positive if they are substitutes.

      Under these conditions, the price of healthy behavior model (no

variation in a, c, and e) makes the same predictions as the cost of contra-

ception model if m and q are complements and makes the same predictions as

the health endowment model if m and q are substitutes. We do not emphasize

this model because the equation that generates selection pertains to the

probability of giving birth. The cost of contraception and abortion and

the health endowment of the fetus are more proximate determinants of this

probability than the cost of engaging in healthy behaviors. But it should

be kept in mind that our results are open to more than one interpretation.

     The empirical relevance of the cost of contraception model is high-

lighted by recent research by Forrest (1988), Forrest and Fordyce (1988),

and Jones et a]. (1988). These studies show that nonuse of effective

contraceptive methods by women aged 15 through 44 is a point of concern in

the United States. Moreover, contraceptive use is much lower and the abor-

tion rate is much higher in the U.S. than in Canada and most Western

European countries. These findings are attributed to the wider availabilty

of contraceptive services and to the higher level of information concerning

these services in the countries to which the U.S. was compared.9    It is

plausible that the forces that generate a larger mean shadow price of
                                     — 13   —




contraception   in the U.S. also generate substantial differences in this

price among U.S. residents.

     Note that it is somewhat of an oversimplification to view induced

abortion as a substitute for conventional contraceptive methods. In part

this is the case, but abortion also is a remedy for contraceptive failure.

It gives parents the option virtually to eliminate uncertainties associated

with the number and spacing of births at a positive price. An analysis of

the determinants of this decision is beyond the scope of this paper. But

persons who find it less difficult (less costly) to correct their mistakes

should be more likely to resort to an abortion in the event of a contracep-

tive failure. To be specific, given the considerable amount of evidence

that education raises productive and allocative efficiency in the market

and in the household (Welch 1970; Grossman 1972; Michael 1972; Rosenzweig

and Schultz 1982a, 1983; Edwards and Grossman 1983; Wozniak 1987), the more

educated may have higher abortion propensities even if they have lower

costs of contraception.

     To estimate the three equation model of birth outcomes, we employ pro-

cedures developed by Ileckman (1979). The estimation method not only yields

the covariances (a12 and a13) but also recognizes that the coefficients of

the birthweight production function are biased if the censored nature of

the birth sample is ignored. Thus, it provides an estimate of the prenatal

care coefficient (p2) that potentially controls both for adverse selection

and for favorable selection in input use. This coefficient is biased downward

by adverse selection and biased upward by favorable selection in computations

that ignore these factors.

      Equations (1), (2), and (3) pertain to all pregnant women, but the
last two are observed only for women who give birth. These are women for

whom it1     0 or u —ajz1. In such a sample, the expected value of birth—

As emphasized by Heckman, if u11 and u21 are correlated, the conditional

mean of u2i in equation (7) is not zero, and the regressors in the equation

are correlated with the disturbance term. Hence, ordinary least squares

estimates of its coefficients are biased. Exactly the same comments apply

to equation (B). As we have already seen, there are good reasons to expect

a12 and 0j3 to be nonzero.

     Heckman has shown that unbiased estimates of equations (7)and (8) can

be obtained under the assumption that the joint distributions of u11, U2i

and uli, u31 are bivariate normal densities. His procedure is to fit the

birth probability equation (1) as a probit function and to compute the

inverse of Mill's ratio (A) for each woman who gives birth:


                                      =    f(Q)/F(Qi).                             (9)



Here Q =    alzi/aj    and f and F are, respectively, the density and distribu-

tion functions for a standard normal variable. The inverse of Mill's ratio

is then inserted as a regressor in equations (1) and (B) which, after

adding disturbance terms with zero means (v2i and v3i). become

            b1 =   $1Xi   + $2mi +   (al2/a1)A         + V21                 (10)

Note that the coefficients of Ai in (10) and (11) estimate a12 and a13,

respectively, up to a positive scale factor (1/a1).10

    One conceptual issue that arises in the context of the estimation of

the model pertains to the potential endogeneity of prenatal care in the

birthweight production function. It is clear that m1 and the disturbance

term (u21) in the birthweight production function (2) are correlated if u2

is correlated with the disturbance term (uai) in the demand function for

prenatal care (3). From equation (6), a23 is nonzero unless

—A474ae =                            Although the disturbance terms in (2) and (3)
            3T2aqc43Y3aqa.
undoubtedly are correlated, the disturbance terms in (10) and (11) are less

likely to be correlated because both equations include the inverse of

Mill's ratio (Ai) as a regressor. Oifferences in A1 among women who give

birth reflect differences in the health endowment of the fetus and the

costs of contraception and abortion. Since these factors generate the

correlation between disturbance terms, the biases that they introduce are

reduced when A1 is employed in the equation.

    More formally, weighted (to correct for heteroskedacticity) ordinary

least squares estimation of the birthweight production function is

appropriate when a sin9le factor generates the three covariances among the

disturbance terms. For example, suppose that only the health endowment

varies. Then each of the three pairwise correlation coefficients (Ph)

equals one in absolute value, and the coefficient of A1 in the estimated
                                      — 16 —




birthweight   equation (8474°e) differs from the coefficient of the health

endowment (e) in the structural birthweight equation (84) only by a posi-

tive scale factor (a4ae). Now suppose that cost of contraception model

fully described the data. Then P1rP23°qc/°c and p13=1. Once again, the

coefficient of A1 in the birthweight production function (8aa2aqc/ac) dif-

fers from the coefficient of the healthy behavior input (q) In the struc-

tural equation ($)   only   by a positive scale factor (a2aqc/ac). When more

than one factor varies, two—stage least squares estimation of the produc-

tion function with prenatal care treated as an endogenous variable may be

appropriate. We examine this proposition by using the two-stage least

squares probit method for simultaneous equations models with selectivity

developed by Lee, Maddala, and Trost (1980) and the Wu—Hausman endogeneity

test (Wu 1973; Hausman 1978).


                            II. Data and Estimation


    Data on births and abortions are from New   York City vital statistics in
1984. In that year there were approximately 105,000 singleton live births

and 89,000 induced abortion to New York City residents. Our analysis is

based on randomly chosen subsamples of the combined population of births

and induced abortions.12 We examined 11,591 pregnancies to white,

non—Hispanic women twenty years and older and 11,016 pregnancies to black,

non-Hispanic women of the same age.13 We excluded adolescents in order to

minimize problems of endogeneity. This issue is discussed in greater

detail below.

    Our analysis is made possible because nany of the parental charac—

ter-istics   reported on the birth certificates are also reported on the

induced termination records. Thus, by concatenating the data sets we were

able to specify an equation predicting the probability of giving birth,

given a woman was pregnant. A description of the variables is provided in

Table 1. The means and proportions within each subsample are presented in

Table 2.

    Data from the abortion and birth certificates were augmented with 1980

census data which had been aggregated from the census tract to the health

area level. The health area is the smallest geographical area identified

on the birth and abortion certificates. New York City is divided into 352

health areas. The average health area contains between 15,000 and 25,0.00

residents. The census data enabled us to calculate the percentage of per-

sons below the poverty level in each health area by race.

    The vital statistics were also augmented with variables that measure

the availability of various reproductive health services. Combining data

from the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the New York City Department of

Health, we knew the number of family planning clinics, abortion providers.

and prenatal clinics by health area in 1983. These availability measures

were divided by the number of women 15 to 44 in a health area in 1980. The

denominators were from the 1980 census. A fourth availability measure was

a dichotomous variable that equaled one if the women lived in a health

district in which was located a health center operated by the Federal

Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).14 WIC

had thirteen locations in New York City in 1983 where women could enroll

and receive food coupons. Nine of these centers also housed maternal and

infant    care (M and I) projects. They provide prenatal and obstetrical care

to poor women under the 1963 amendment to Title V of the Social Security

Act.

       The weight of a child at birth is our indicator of infant health

((equation (2)]. The literature linking birthweight to infant mortality

and childhood morbidity is voluminous (Institute of Medicine 1965).

Prenatal care Is measured by the number of months a woman delays before

seeking medical care for her pregnancy (equation 3). Women who received no

care are assumed to have delayed 10 months. This prenatal care measure

should be negatively related to birthweight. The birth probability

equation has a dichotomous dependent variable: one if the women gives

birth, zero if she aborts [(equation (1)].

       The specification of the birthweight production function is based on

the structural relationship between medical and biological inputs and the

birth outcome. Thus, in addition to prenatal care, we include the

newborn's sex, dichotomous variables for older women and marital status.

the number of previous live births as well as the number of previous late

spontaneous abortions. The latter two inputs may control for, in part, a

woman's reproductive capability. To measure the quality of care we include

an indication of whether the child was delivered by the patient's private

physician or whether the delivery was performed by a general service physi-

cian. Following Grossman (1972), mother's education is used to control for

efficiency in household production. Finally, we employ three dichotomous

variables that indicate whether the pregnancy was complicated by alcohol,

drugs, or tobacco.

    We   treat the prenatal care demand equation (equation 3) and birth pro-

bability equation as reduced forms. In addition to the mother's charac-

teristics such as age, marital status, and obstetric history, we included

the method of finance as well as the areal measures of reproductive health

services and the race—specific poverty rate. The method of finance has

three categories: Medicaid, other third party (private health insurance or

health maintenance organization), or self—payJ5

    With respect to prenatal care, we expect women on Medicaid and women

who paid for the birth themselves to delay the initiation of prenatal care

longer than women whose care is financed by private health insurance.

Women applying for Medicaid for the first time may experience delays in

processing their applications. Moreover, all Medicaid recipients may face

greater search costs since many providers do not accept Medicaid due to the

level of reimbursement. In the birth probability equation, however, it is

unclear a priori whether Medicaid recipients are more likely to abort than

non-Medicaid recipients. New York State finances abortions for Medicaid

eligible women, and thus the out—of—pocket costs are zero. Yet, Medicaid

status clearly measures poverty. If the opportunity costs of giving birth

are lower for poor than nonpoor women, then Medicaid status could be posi-

tively related to the probability of giving birth.

   As discussed in Section I, we apply Heckman's two-step procedure to

correct for biases due to self—selection. Following Lee, Trost and Maddala

(1980) we also estimate a model in which prenatal care is treated as an

endogenous input in the birthweight equation. Both models require that we

impose restrictions in order to achieve identification. As mentioned
                                   — 23   —




above, the birthweight equation excludes measures of income and availabi-
lity. At the same time it includes the sex of the child and whether the

birth was complicated by alcohol, narcotics, or tobacco, and whether the

birth was delivered by a private physician. Thus, the birthweight equation

easily meets the rank and order conditions for indentification.

    Identification of the prenatal care demand function is more problema-

tic. Identification can be achieved via the nonlinear relationship between

the inverse of Mill's ratio (A) and the regressors in the birth probability

equation. In other words, even if the vector      in equation (1) and the

vector y1 in equation (3) contain the same set of variables, the equations

are still identified. Nevertheless, the model is on firmer grounds if

there are unique determinants of each equation.

    We assume that the availability of family planning clinics, the availa-

bility of abortion providers, and the number of previous induced abortions

have no impact on the demand for prenatal care. This is most defensible

in a model in which variations in the health endowment are small, so that

differences in the monetary and psychic costs of contraception and abortion

are fully captured by variations in A. Moreover, unlike spontaneous abor-

tions, there is little evidence that links induced abortions to subsequent

reproductive difficulties (Hogue. Cates, and Tietze 1982). We include

parity in the prenatal care demand equation but exclude it from the birth

probability equation because the left-hand side of the latter equation is

mechanically related to parity.16 We include parity in the prenatal care

demand function because it proxies experience with pregnancy and birth. In

addition, parity and the number of late spontaneous abortions may control,
                                      — 24   —




 in   part, for a woman's health endowment. Finally, the availability of pre-

 natal care clinics and WIC centers are obvious determinants of the receipt

of early prenatal care but much less closely related to optimal family size

and the decision to give birth.17

      Although the birth probability function is termed a reduced form

equation, certain regressors in it are potentially endogenous. Among

teenagers, for instance, education may determine the probability of

aborting, but the years of schooling completed is clearly related to the

time spent pregnant (Hofferth 1987). A similar issue occurs between

Medicaid status and pregnancy resolution. Among unmarried, nulliparous

adolescents, giving birth is a precondition for receiving continued support

from Medicaid and additional support from welfare. Marital status is a

third example. Between 1980 and 1981, 28 percent of all white first births

to adolescents were conceived premaritally, but born inside of marriage

(O'Connell and Rogers 1984). In short, the decision to give birth, espe-

cially among adolescents, may be determined simultaneously with the deci-

sion to complete school, apply for Medicaid, or get married (Leibowitz,

Eisen, and Chow 1986; Joyce 1988). Therefore, to minimize these problems

we estimate the model for women twenty years of age or more since the endo-

geneity of marital status, Medicaid, and education should be less relevant

for these women.

      We treat prenatal medical care as the only endogenous variable in the

birthweight production function, yet other variables in this equation could

be viewed in a similar manner. These include mother's age, parity, and

cigarette smoking, all of which are treated as endogenous by Rosenzweig and
                                   — 25 —




Schultz (1982, 1983b, forthcoming a, forthcomingb) in the estimation of
birthweight production functions in the 1967—69 and 1980 U.S. National

Natality Followback Surveys. We examine the endogeneity of prenatal care

alone in the production function because we have a well—specified equation

for the demand for this input. Moreover, both the birthweight production

function and the prenatal care demand function must be estimated to ascer-

tain whether the cost of contraception, the cost of abortion, or the health

endowment of the fetus is the dominant unmeasured determinant of reproduc-

tive outcomes. The estimation of other equations is not essential in

accomplishing this goal. Since prenatal care is the dependent variable in

the demand function, it is logical to consider its endogeneity in the pro-

duction function.

    We do not deny the validity of Rosenzweig and Schultz's methodology and

the value of their contribution. We wish to emphasize, however, that our

objective is different from theirs. We incorporate the choice—based nature

of micro vital records into the estimation of birthweight production func-

tions, while they focus solely on live births. In contrast, their aim is to

treat a variety of variables as endogenous. In addition to the different

objectives of the studies, we do not endogenize variables other than prena-

tal care because Rosenzweig and Schultz use national samples. Thus, many

more instrumental variables are available to them.'8 Moreover, the two—

stage least squares estimates on which they focus are not obtained at zero

cost. One of their main instrumental variables is mother's schooling which

may be determined simultaneously with family size, particularly since they

do not exclude teenagers. In addition, Rosenzweig and Schultz omit

mother's   schooling from the birthweight production function. Although they

present statistical evidence in support of this exclusion (Rosenzweig and

Schultz 1981). it is not consistent with the theoretical and empirical

literature on the productive efficiency of education in nonmarket produc-

tion that we have cited.

    Finally, we choose a linear functional form because the true rela-

tionship between birthweight and infant or childhood health is not known.

The linear form has the virtue of simplicity. The use of a linear func-

tional form rules out an investigation of the optimal input mix (the com-

bination of inputs that minimize the cost of producing a given level of

infant health), but this is not the focus of our empirical research.

Moreover, we include only one measured endogenous input.


                                III. Results


    Empirical estimates of the birth probability equation and prenatal

care demand equations are presented in Table 3. The birth probability

equation is estimated by maximum likelihood probit. Two estimates of the

prenatal care demand equation are shown. The first is estimated by ordinary

least squares (OLS) without correcting for selection. The second employs the

inverse of Mill's ratio as a regressor and adjusts the standard errors as

suggested by Heckman (1979). Table 4 presents three estimates of the birth—

weight production function. The first equation is obtained by OLS with no

attempt to correct for selection or endogeneity. The second specification

corrects for selection but treats prenatal care as exogenous. The third uses

the two—stage least squares (TSLS) procedure outlined by Lee, Maddala, Trost

(1980) to   correct for the endogeneity of prenatal care as well as for selec-

tivity.

    Regardless of race, legitimacy status, the number of previous induced

abortions, the number of previous spontaneous abortions, and Medicaid eli-

gibility are statistically significant predictors of the probability of

giving birth.     In particular, women who are not married, and women who have

had at least one induced abortion prior to the current pregnancy are less

likely to give birth. Women who are eligible for Medicaid and women who

have involuntarily lost a previous pregnancy are more likely to give birth.

As indicated in Section II, the sign of the Medicaid effect is ambiguous

on a priori grounds. Therefore, the last result is notable because it

duplicates the one found in a recent study of adolescents by Leibowitz,

Eisen, and Chow (1986). They reported that unmarried teenagers who were

eligible for Medicaid financing of an abortion or a delivery were more

likely to keep their babies in a sample of California residents in the

period 1972-74.

    Among blacks, there appears to be a linear relationship between years

of completed schooling and the likelihood of an abortion. However, among

whites, the relationship is more u-shaped. White pregnant women with be-

tween nine and eleven years of schooling are the most likely to give birth.

Following national aggregates, older pregnant women of both races have a

greater probability of terminating the current pregnancy than women twenty

to thirty-four years of age (Henshaw et al. 1985).

    With regard to the areal characteristics, white women living in neigh-

borhoods of relative poverty have a greater than average propensity to
                                       - 30   -




abort.    Poverty has no impact on pregnancy resolution among blacks. The

availability of abortion providers increases the probability of terminating

a pregnancy for white women, but it has the opposite effect for black

women.

     In discussing the birthweight production functions and prenatal care

demand   functions,   we focus on the role of sample selection bias and on the

effect of prenatal care on birthweight. There is strong evidence of selec-

tivity bias in the birthweight production function and prenatal demand equation

among blacks. There is no evidence of such bias among whites. For blacks, the

results suggest that the unobserved factors which raise the probability of

giving birth are positively correlated with the unobserved factors that

decrease delay in the initiation of prenatal care and increase birthweight.

    For black women the sign patterns among the residual covariances are

consistent with a model that emphasizes the cost of contraceptive. In par-

ticular, black women for whom the shadow price of contraception is relati-

vely high are more likely to experience an unintended pregnancy and more

likely to carry the pregnancy to term than their counterparts who face a

lower shadow price and whose pregnancies were more likely to have been

planned. The latter group should consume more prenatal care (delay less)

and invest in other healthy behaviors that improve birthweight.

    One explanation for the racial differences with respect to selectivity

bias is that the shadow price of contraception is greater for blacks than

it is for whites. Further, the shadow price is apt to vary more among

blacks than it does among whites. Racial differences in contraceptive use

and abortion are consistent with this interpretation (Pratt et al. 1984;
                                    — 31 —



Henshaw et al. 1985; Stephen, Rindfuss, and Bean 1986).

    Failure to correct for self—selection can yield biased estimates of the

health technology. For example, the effect of illegitimacy rises by 50

percent in absolute value when lambda is included in the birthweight

equation for blacks. Since unmarried women are more likely to abort, those

who do not abort may have lower contraceptive costs. As a result, the

coefficient on illegitimacy is understated if lambda is omitted. It should

also be noted that the impact of post—secondary education falls and the

incremental benefit of a high school diploma becomes statistically insigni-

ficant when selectivity bias is corrected.

    Our results for blacks indicate that women who aborted would have given

birth to lighter infants if they had selected the birth option and if they

had had the same mean values of the observed variables in the birthweight

equation as women who actually gave birth. One way to gauge the magnitude

of the effect is to compare it to that of an observed risk factor for birth

outcomes. Among blacks, complication due to smoking reduce birthweight by

187 grams or by 5.8 percent relative to a mean of 3,184 for pregnancies not

complicated Dy smoking.19 On the other hand, potential mean birthweight in

the abortion sample falls short of birthweight in the birth sample by 116

grams due to unobserved inputs alone.20 This amounts to a differential of 3.7

percent relative to the observed mean of 3,173 for all black women in the birth

sample. Thus, the impact of unobserved healthy behaviors is almost two-thirds

as large in absolute value as the effect of smoking. Finally, if we allow for

differences in both observed and unobserved characteristics, the potential mean

birthweight of women who aborted would have 140 grams less than the observed
                                   — 32   —




mean birthweight.

    As expected the OLS coefficients of prenatal care delay are negative.

That is, the longer a woman delays between conception and her first prena-

tal care visit, the lighter the infant at birth. In the case of whites,

each month of delay reduces birthweight by 4.4 grams, but the coefficient is

not significant at the 5 percent level on a one—tailed test. The figure for

blacks is 12.4, which is significant at the 5 percent level. The results for

whites are almost identical to the OLS estimates obtained by Rosenzweig and

Schultz (forthcoming a) with data on births to women of all races from the 1980

U.S. National Natality Followback Survey. However, Rosenzweig and Schultz

emphasize the TSLS estimates which reveal that a month's delay in the ini-

tiation of prenatal care decreases birthweight by 91 grams, a twenty-fold

increase over the estimates they obtain by OLS.

    The results of treating prenatal care as an endogenous input are pre-

sented in Table 4. The TSLS estimate for blacks is three times greater

than the corfficient obtained by OLS; the TSLS estimate remains statisti-

cally significant at the 5 percent level. For whites the coefficient of prena-

tal care increases six—fold when estimated by TSLS but the null hypothesis of

no effect cannot be rejected. Although the direction of the change between the

OLS and TSLS estimates is similar to that obtained by Rosenzweig and Schultz,

the magnitude of the change is substantially less. Moreover, we find no

empirical evidence that prenatal care should be treated as endogenous.2'

Following Heckman (1980) and later Nakamura and Hakamura (1981), we applied a

Wu test in which the residuals from the equation predicting prenatal care

corrected for selection were entered as a right—hand—side regressor in the
                                    — 33 —




birthweight   equation. We could not reject the null hypothesis of no correla-

tion in either the white or black specifications at the 5 percent level. The

relevant F statistics are presented in Table 4.

    A comparison of our results with those of Rosenzweig and Schultz, however,

is limited for several reasons. First, our data is restricted to New York City

whereas the National Natality Survey samples women from across the country.

Furthermore, we were able to estimate a race—specific model which proved to be

important. Third, the National Survey excludes out-of—wedlock births. Over 57

percent of all births to black women in the United States and over 70 percent

in New York are born out—of-wedlock (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Fourth,

given our focus on self—selection, we treated only prenatal care as an endoge-

nous input whereas Rosenzweig and Schultz included age, parity and smoking as

endogenous.22 Fifth, our specification of the birthweight equation production

function included additional inputs such as education, the sex of the newborn,

and a measure of the quality of care. In regressions not shown, the omission

of education tended to raise the effect of early prenatal care on birthweight.

Finally, if the inclusion of lambda controls in part for variations in the

endowment as well as the consumption of other endogenous inputs (see Section

I), then the need for TSLS may be attenuated.


                              IV. Conclusion


   Recent attempts to obtain structural estimates of the infant health

technology have used TSLS to control for adverse selection in input use.     In

this paper we have presented a model in which the decision to give birth among

pregnant women allows for a more general form of self-selection. Because of
                                                                                 /




                                     — 34   -




the   widespread availability and use of abortion in New York City, women who

choose to give birth bring to their pregnancies a set of unobserved factors or

behaviors that are associated with the increased consumption of prenatal care

and increased birthweight.

      We found selection to be race—specific. Only among black women is the

decision to give birth correlated with healthy behavior and improved birth

outcomes. The result is consistent with the interpretation that the mean

shadow price of contraception and the variance in this price are greater for

blacks than for whites. This suggests that in areas where abortion availabi-

lity is limited, holding the price of contraception constant, the selection

process encouraged by abortion will be muted. Evidence for that latter has

been reported by Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1987) and Joyce (1987) with

county-level data.

      In sum, the findings presented here should be considered preliminary.

Although they highlight the relationship between pregnancy resolution and

the infant health technology, much more work is needed. First, the model

should be tested on national data in which variations in the shadow price

of abortion are likely to be greater. Second, better data is needed on why

women abort. Rapid advances in fetal diagnoses and the increased spread of

perinatal AIDS will tend to encourage more selective abortion. Such trends

will emphasize a model in which the health endowment of the women becomes a

more important factor in the resolution of pregnancies as well as the inci-

dence of congenital abnormalities among newborns. And finally, the results

presented here suggest that important gains in our understanding of Dirth

outcomes and prenatal behavior could come from a model that allows the
                                     — 35 —



information   encapsuled in pregnancy intentions as well as pregnancy resolu—

tions to impact on infant health. This study represents a first step in

that direction.

    1To control for adverse selection caused by health heterogeneity

Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, i983a, 1983b, forthcoming a, forthcoming 0);

Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1987); and Joyce (1987) use local area prices,

parents' income, and parents' education as instrumental variables. If,

however, the source of bias is due to omitted endogenous inputs such as

nutrition, exercise, and the avoidance of stress, the last two instruments
may be inappropriate.

    2Leibowitz, Eisen, and Chow (1986) and Joyce (1988) study the decision

to abort a pregnancy in an economic context. But they do not incorporate

this decision into a larger scale model of the optimal number and quality

of children and the choice of contraceptive techniques. Moreover, they do

not use the information conveyed by the decision to abort or give birth to

estimate infant health production functions.

    3An increase in the endowment is equivalent to an increase in real

income. Provided all commodities in the utility function are superior,

their optimal values rise. We use the tern "very likely" in the text

because we do not fully take account of induced substitution between the

optimal number of children and their quality (health) that occurs in the

model developed by Becker and Lewis (1973).

    4To the extent that there are measured components of the price of

contraception, such as mother's education or the availability of family

planning clinics, these components are now included in the x.j vector.

Similar comments apply to the other variables.

    5Note that adverse or favorable selection in pregnancy resolution is

determined by the sign of correlation between the disturbance term in the

birth probability equation and the disturbance term in the birthweight

equation. Adverse or favorable selection in input use is determined by the

sign of the correlation between the disturbance tern in the birthweight

equation and the disturbance term in the prenatal care equation. Although

the procedure described below does not yield an estimate of a23, its sign
                                                F—3

can be inferred from the signs of a12 and a13 in a single factor model.

With more than one factor, the sign of a23 can be inferred by placing

reasonable restrictions on the magnitudes of certain parameters. For

example, suppose that e and a vary while c does not. In addition, suppose

that a12 is positive. The necessary condition for a23 to be negative

(which is plausible since °13 must be negative) is A474° c _$373Cqa

When $=    $ and    74= y3, this is satisfied provided a 0qa•

    6The above statement is subject to one modification. The case in which

the effects of the determinants exactly offset each other (a12 = 013 =

    = 0)   cannot be distinguished from one in which each effect taken alone

is zero.

    7This can be illustrated in the context of a simple model in which the

following utility function is maximized:

                       U =    U(b(m,q),    q, n, s].

Here n is the number of births and s is adult consumption. Let p* be the

money price of q, let the money prices of m and s each equal one dollar,

and let a subscript denote a partial derivative. First-order conditions

for m, q, n, and s are

                       Ubbm =

                                 + Uq =   pp*
                       Ubbq
                       Un = Jim

                             =

where t    is   the marginal utility of income. Hence

                                      [p* -     (Uq/JA)]/fl.
                       (bq/bm)

The last equation equates the ratio of marginal products in the production
                                          F—4

of birthweight to the input price ratio. According to this equation, the

price of input q is p* —   (Uq/.t).   Clearly, this price is endogenous because

Uq/P depends on the arguments in the utility function. Exogenous deter-

minants of this variable enter the birth probability and prenatal care

equations. For example, suppose that the utility function of the .jth

family is
                      =
                          b'1   +
                                    q2i   ÷ nt3i +
                                                     s4i
Then the ratio of $2j to •4i serves as an unobservable in birth outcomes.

    8Based on the notation in note 7, a reduction in the price of an infant

health input could reduce the quantity of b or n demanded but not both.

This is due to induced substitution between the two variables generated by

the endogeneity of their shadow prices (Becker and Lewis 1973; Willis

1973). Of course, both b and n could rise as the price of an infant health

input falls. In our context b is unlikely to fall unless q and m are very

good substitutes, and this implausible result is ruled out. Even if n

falls with p, the probability of giving birth should rise. This is because

some of the unobserved factors that cause p to vary are also likely to

cause the efficiency and psychic cost of contraception to vary.

    9To be specific, contraceptives are considered to be preventive care in

the U.S. and are not covered by most health insurance policies. A second

factor is the structure of the U.S. health care system. In other countries

women go to one doctor, usually a family practitioner, for all their medi-

cal needs. In the U.S. specialists dominate. Women must go to a gynecolo-

gist for birth control and have the responsibility for finding a provider.

A third factor is that family planning clinics are widely used in other
                                   F-.5


countries, but in the U.S. they have the stigma of being primarily directed

at poor women. Finally, the amount of contraceptive information provided

by schools, radio, television, newspapers, and magazines is more limited in

the U.S.


   10The two step procedure just described yields consistent, although

inefficient, estimates. Efficient estimates can be obtained by maximum

likelihood procedures in which the three equations are estimated simulta-

neously, and the residual covariances (a12 and a13) are obtained directly.

The maximum likelihood estimates are not presented in Section III because

they were almost identical to the two step estimates with an exogenous pre-

natal care measure. When prenatal care is treated as endogenous (see

below), the likelihood function is too complicated to pursue estimation

methods other than the two—stage least squares probit method for simulta-

neous equations models with selectivity developed by Lee, Maddala, and

Trost (1980). For the same reason, we avoid a bivariate probit model with

sample selection in which continuous birthweight is replaced by a dichoto-

mous indicator of low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams). In particular,

estimation of this model is not feasible when prenatal care is endogenous.

   t1There were several reasons for choosing New York City. First, only 12

states in the U.S. maintain detailed information on induced abortions as

part of their vital registration system (Griner—Powell 1986). Second, the

large number of minorities in New York City permitted a race—specific ana-

lysis. Third, New York City birth and induced termination certificates

contain items that are not recorded in other states ——   specifically,   how

the birth and abortion were financed, whether the procedure was performed
                                    F—B

 by the patient's private physician, and whether the pregnancy was compli-

 cated by alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.

    t2We do not include women whose pregnancies were terminated by spon-

 taneous abortion. Early spontaneous abortions are poorly reported. The

New York City Department of Health reported 4,960 spontaneous abortions in

 1984. This represented less than 4.4 percent of all live births. Yet,

data from the National Survey of Family growth indicate that the ratio of

spontaneous abortions to live births is greater than .21 (Pratt et al. 1.984).

   13Our analysis is race-specific because there are substantial differen-

ces in birth outcomes, prenatal behavior, and abortion rates between whites

and blacks (Henshaw et al. 1985; Corman, Joyce, and Grossman 1987). We

exclude Hispanics in order to focus on white and black differences and to

make our results more comparable to previously published work. Moreover,

it has been argued recently that Hispanics should not be lumped together

because differences in medical care utilization, birth outcomes, and abor-

tions among, for example, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Cubans are of a non-

trivial magnitude (Williams, Binkin, and Clingman 1986; Schur, Bernstein,

and Berk 1981; Joyce 1988). We hope to explore these differences in sub-

sequent research.

   14lhere are 30 health districts in New York City. Each contains

approximately 10 health areas,

   151n the birth probability equation the method of finance is reduced to

two categories, Medicaid and all others. The self-pay category is dif-

ficult to interpret in this equation because third—party coverage of abor—
                                             F—7

tions is   not common. Among women who give birth, however, third party
coverage more accurately reflects a well-insured individual.

   t6That is, a woman gives birth if her optimal number of children is less

than or equal to parity plus one. Both the optimal number of children and

parity (which for a given family size measures the timing and spacing of

births) are governed by command over resources, prices, efficiency, tastes,

marital status, and mother's age.

   t7Our results were not sensitive to these identification restrictions.

   18Por instance, the price of cigarettes varies considerably among states

due primarily to differences in state excise tax rates on cigarettes. Our

cigarette measure also is difficult to endogenize because it is dichotomous

and pertains to pregnancies complicated by smoking rather than to the quan-

tity smoked while pregnant. Both these characteristics also apply to the

alcohol and narcotics variables, while the indicator of the quality of

medical care (delivery by the woman1s private physician) is dichotomous.

   19Although our measure of cigarette smoking is a dichotomous indicator,

the 187 gram differential is almost identical to that estimated by

Rosenzweig and Schultz (forthcoming a) in the 1980 National Natality

Survey.

ratio in the birth sample and                is the mean of the inverse of Mill's

ratio, defined as —f(Q1)/[1—F(Q)], in the abortion sample. Thus, the mean

birthweight difference between those who gave birth and those who aborted

had they instead given birth is:

           bb — ba =                 + A2(mbma) +
                       øl(XbXa)
The last term in this equation is positive given a12 > 0. It also represents

the difference in birthweight due to unobserved factors. The first two terms

to the right of the equal sign tapture the differences due to observed charac-

teristics.    It should be noted that some of the variables in the Xb vector

were not observed for women who aborted. Thus, to calculate the mean poten-

tial birthweight of women who aborted we assumed that the proportion of women

who used tobacco, drugs and alcohol as well as the proportion male infants and

the proportion of women served by private physicians were the same between the

two samples. To test the sensitivity of our results to this assumption, we

re—estimated the model excluding these five variables from the birthweight

equation. The difference between the observed mean and the potential mean

birthweight was not altered appreciably.

   21The reader is reminded that this result is specific to a model which

controls for self selection into the birth sample.

we excluded parity, age and legitimacy status from the demand for prenatal

care. The omission had negligible effect on the TSLS estimates.
