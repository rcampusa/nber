Equity Vesting and Managerial Myopia

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper links the impending vesting of CEO equity to reductions in real investment. Existing studies
measure the manager’s short-term concerns using the sensitivity of his equity to the stock price. However,
in myopia theories, the driver of short-termism is not the magnitude of incentives but their horizon.
We use recent changes in compensation disclosure to introduce a new empirical measure that is tightly
linked to theory - the sensitivity of equity vesting over the upcoming year. This sensitivity is determined
by equity grants made several years prior, and thus unlikely to be driven by current investment opportunities.
An interquartile increase is associated with a decline of 0.11% in the growth of R&D (scaled by total
assets), 37% of the average R&D growth rate. Similar results hold when including advertising and
capital expenditure. Newly-vesting equity increases the likelihood of meeting or beating analyst earnings
forecasts by a narrow margin. However, the market’s reaction to doing so is lower, suggesting that
it recognizes CEOs’ myopic incentives.

This paper studies the link between real investment decisions and the vesting horizon of a CEO’s

equity incentives. We find that research and development (“R&D”) is negatively associated with

the stock price sensitivity of stock and options that vest over the course of the same year. This

association continues to hold when including advertising and capital expenditure in the

investment measure. Moreover, CEOs with significant newly-vesting equity are more likely to

meet or beat analyst consensus forecasts by a narrow margin. These results provide empirical

support for managerial myopia theories.

   Many academics and practitioners believe that managerial myopia is a first-order problem

faced by the modern firm. While the 20th century firm emphasized cost efficiency, Porter (1992)

argues that “the nature of competition has changed, placing a premium on investment in

increasingly complex and intangible forms”, such as innovation, employee training, and

organizational development. However, the myopia theories of Stein (1988, 1989) show that

managers may fail to invest due to concerns with the firm’s short-term stock price. Since the

benefits of intangible investment are only visible in the long run, the immediate effect of such

investment is to depress earnings and thus the current stock price. Therefore, a manager aligned

with the short-term stock price may turn down valuable investment opportunities.

   Despite its perceived importance, myopia is very difficult to test empirically. Standard

measures of CEO incentives (e.g., Hall and Liebman (1998)) quantify the sensitivity of

managerial wealth to the stock price stemming from his stock and option compensation.

However, in myopia models, the driver of short-termism is not the overall level of equity

compensation, but the weighting of this compensation towards the short-term as opposed to long-

term stock price (Stein (1988, 1989)). Equity that does not vest until the long term will deter

rather than induce myopia (Edmans, Gabaix, Sadzik, and Sannikov (2012)).



                                               2
      However, operationalizing this theoretical concept empirically is tricky.                        The ideal

experiment would be for the CEO to be forced to sell some equity for exogenous reasons, and to

be aware of this forced sale ahead of time so that this expectation affects his actions. (This is

indeed how short-term concerns arise in the Stein (1989) model). However, identifying sales

that are both exogenous and predictable by the CEO is difficult. Unexpected forced sales (e.g.,

due to sudden liquidity needs) are likely exogenous, but typically unobservable by researchers

and unpredictable by the CEO. Actual discretionary sales are observable to researchers, but

likely endogenous for two reasons. First, omitted variables may drive both actual sales and

investment. For example, the manager’s negative private information on firm prospects may

cause him both to sell equity and to reduce investment. Second, some actual sales (e.g., due to

sudden liquidity needs) may have been unpredictable by the CEO. Thus, actual sales are a poor

proxy for the ideal explanatory variable, predicted sales, leading to measurement error.

      We measure a manager’s myopic tendencies using the sensitivity of his stock and options

that are scheduled to vest over the upcoming year. We show that this sensitivity is highly

correlated with actual sales: in the absence of private information, a risk-averse manager should

sell his equity upon vesting. However, while a CEO’s actual sales are an endogenous decision,

the amount of newly-vesting equity is largely driven by the magnitude and vesting horizon of

equity grants made several years prior.1 For the same reason, it is known to the CEO in advance.

We identify the equity that is scheduled to vest in a given year using a recently-available dataset

from Equilar.         This dataset contains grant-by-grant information on an executive’s options,

including whether they are vested or unvested. We can thus identify at an individual grant level

the number of options that switch from unvested to vested in a given year. This grant-level


1
    Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2013) show that most vesting periods are between three and five years.


                                                          3
information allows us to calculate the delta of the vesting options, which captures the manager’s

incentive to inflate the stock price. Equilar also provides the number of vesting shares; since the

delta of a share is 1, this number does not need to be decomposed into individual grants.

   We use the sensitivity of newly-vesting equity in two ways. First, we employ it as the

explanatory variable of interest, relating it to changes in several measures of long-term

investment. Our primary measure is R&D scaled by total assets, but we also include advertising

and two measures of capital expenditure.            We control for determinants of investment

opportunities and the firm’s ability to finance investment, firm and year fixed effects, and other

components of CEO compensation – for example, the CEO’s unvested equity, his already-vested

equity, and the standard components of salary and bonus.

   We find a negative and significant relationship between nearly all measures of investment

and the sensitivity of newly-vesting equity.     For example, an interquartile increase in this

sensitivity is associated with a 0.11 percentage point decline in the growth of R&D scaled by

total assets, which corresponds to 37% of the average growth in R&D scaled by total assets, 2%

of the average R&D-to-assets ratio, and an average decline in R&D of approximately $1 million

per year. Our results suggest that firms reduce investment in years in which significant CEO

stock and option holdings vest.

   Newly-vesting equity is of interest as an explanatory variable, since boards may wish to take

into account its link with investment when designing the optimal contract. Similarly, since

boards know the amount of newly-vesting equity at the start of a year, they can predict the

CEO’s incentives to cut investment, and if needed, counteract them. A broader question is how

investment responds to expected equity sales in general. As in the Stein (1989) model, such

sales can stem from channels other than vesting equity – a CEO may voluntarily hold already-



                                                4
vested equity as a long-term investment (e.g., in a family firm), subsequently sell equity to

rebalance his portfolio, and anticipate such sales beforehand. Since actual equity sales are

endogenous, our second use of newly-vesting equity is as an instrument for actual sales. The two

properties of newly-vesting equity discussed earlier – its high correlation with equity sales and

its determination by equity grants several years prior – are analogous to the relevance criterion

and exclusion restriction. We find a negative relationship between instrumented equity sales and

investment. An interquartile increase in equity sales is associated with a 0.25 percentage point

decline in the growth of R&D scaled by total assets, 4.6% of the average R&D-to-assets ratio.

   The negative association between investment and vesting equity (or instrumented equity

sales) can arise from two channels. First, vesting equity could cause a decline in investment.

Managers intending to sell equity reduce investment, to inflate earnings and thus the stock price.

Second, there is no causal relationship but instead the link arises from an omitted variable –

current investment opportunities – that our controls fail to capture. It may be that boards believe

that vesting equity reduces the manager’s investment incentives, and thus schedule equity to vest

precisely when they forecast that investment opportunities will decline.          This explanation

requires boards to be able to forecast investment opportunities several years in advance. Note

that it is still consistent with myopia theories: boards ensure that options do not vest while

investment opportunities are strong because they believe that vesting equity induces myopia.

   To provide further evidence of the first channel, we show that newly-vesting equity is

associated with a higher likelihood that a firm meets the analyst consensus earnings forecast or

beats it by a narrow margin. In contrast, vesting is unrelated to the likelihood of beating the

forecasts by a wide margin, consistent with earnings manipulation being more likely when

earnings are close to the forecast. These results support the idea that vesting equity increases the



                                                 5
CEO’s stock price concerns, but not the alternative hypothesis that equity vesting is correlated

with changes in investment opportunities.

   Finally, we study the market’s reaction to earnings announcements. Controlling for the

earnings realization, the announcement return is significantly lower for firms with higher levels

of vesting equity, perhaps because the market suspects that such firms have incentives to inflate

earnings by cutting investment. This effect is especially strong for firms that meet or beat the

forecast, suggesting that this outcome more likely stems from earnings inflation. These findings

are consistent with the Stein (1989) “signal-jamming” equilibrium, where the market is efficient

and recognizes managers’ myopic behavior.

   This paper is related to a long literature on managerial myopia. In addition to the theories

already cited, other models include Miller and Rock (1985), Narayanan (1985), Bebchuk and

Stole (1993), Bizjak, Brickley, and Coles (1993), Goldman and Slezak (2006), Edmans (2009),

and Benmelech, Kandel, and Veronesi (2010). However, as previously noted, precisely testing

these theories is difficult. McConnell and Muscarella (1985) document positive stock price

reactions to the announcements of capital investments. This result is sometimes interpreted as

evidence against myopia, but can also arise from selection: managers only pursue projects whose

value can be clearly communicated to the market in the short-term and they know will enjoy a

positive reaction. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005) provide survey evidence that 78% of

executives would sacrifice long-term value to meet earnings targets. Using standard measures of

incentives that capture the CEO’s sensitivity to the stock price but not his horizon, Cheng and

Warfield (2005), Bergstresser and Philippon (2006), and Peng and Roell (2008) find a positive

link with earnings management, but Erickson, Hanlon, and Maydew (2006) find no link with

accounting fraud. These conflicting results may arise because, theoretically, it is the horizon



                                               6
rather than level of incentives that induces myopia. Bushee (1998) relates R&D to the horizon of

a firm’s shareholders rather than managers.

    A small number of papers do consider the vesting horizon of incentives. Kole (1997) is the

first to describe vesting horizons, but does not relate them to outcome variables. Johnson, Ryan,

and Tian (2009) show that already-vested stock is related to corporate fraud, but do not study

real investment or upcoming vesting. Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2013) are the first

to systematically analyze the CEO’s horizon, also using Equilar. They develop a new “duration”

measure of incentives, which weights each equity grant by its vesting period. They show how it

varies across industries and with firm characteristics, and link it to earnings management (but do

not investigate real outcomes). In contrast, our goal is to study the link between myopia and

investment, and so our measure of myopic incentives is designed to minimize its correlation with

current investment opportunities. While duration is affected by equity grants in the current year,

which are likely correlated with growth options, newly-vesting equity depends on grants made

several years ago. Although we cannot claim that past grants are completely exogenous to

current investment opportunities and thus make strong causal statements, they are less likely

driven by current investment opportunities than current grants. 2 Finally, a contemporaneous

paper by Ladika and Sautner (2013) shows that FAS 123R induced firms to accelerate the

vesting period of options, and such accelerated vesting led to a reduction in capital expenditure.

Our papers are complementary in that they employ different empirical strategies to investigate

the link between vesting and investment, and find consistent results. While they focus on a one-

time shock, we study vesting (or instrumented equity sales) within a panel of firms. This broader


2
  While we use vesting equity as an instrument for equity sales, Shue and Townsend (2013) use institutional features
of multi-year grant cycles as an instrument for option grants. They study the different question of whether options
induce risk-taking.


                                                         7
setting allows us to quantify the responsiveness of investment to expected equity sales, rather

than the more specific question of how investment responds to changes in the probability of

accelerating options. We also show how vesting equity is related to both the likelihood of

beating earnings forecasts and the market’s response to earnings announcements.

      This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the data, in particular our measure of

myopic incentives. Section 2 presents the investment results, and Section 3 analyzes earnings

announcements. Section 4 concludes.


1     Data and Empirical Specification

      This section describes the calculation of the variables used in our empirical analysis; a

detailed description is in Appendix A.


1.1     Data and Sample

      Since the implementation of FAS 123R in 2006, companies are required to disclose grant-

level (rather than merely aggregate-level) information on each stock and option award held by a

top executive. For an option grant, firms disclose not only the exercise price and expiration date,

which allows us to give each grant a unique identifier, but also details on whether the options are

vested or unvested. In particular, it will split a grant into two if part of the grant is vested and

part remains unvested. We can thus track the vesting of a CEO’s options by studying changes in

the numbers of vested and unvested options with the same exercise price and expiration date.

Separately, Equilar directly reports the number of shares that vest in a given year.

      Given the short time series over which grant-level vesting status is available, we require a

wide cross-section to maximize power. While the data is available in Execucomp for the S&P

1500, we use Equilar as it covers all firms in the Russell 3000. The initial sample consists of



                                                  8
9,385 firm-CEO-years from 2006-2010. 3 After merging with financial statement data from

Compustat and stock return data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), and

removing financial and utilities firms, we obtain the final sample of 2,047 firms and 6,730 firm-

CEO-years (see Table 1, Panel A). The analysis of earnings forecasts uses the Institutional

Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S) database and covers 1,498 firms and 17,173 firm-quarters.


1.2     Measurement of vesting equity

      We obtain the number of shares that vest in a given year directly using the variable “Shares

Acquired on Vesting of Stock” for each year-CEO. Such vesting may come from previously

restricted stock or Long-Term Incentive Plans (“LTIPs”). To calculate the number of newly-

vesting options, we first collect information, grant-by-grant, on the exercise price (EXERPRC),

expiration date (EXPDATE), and number of securities (NUM) for a given CEO’s newly-awarded

options in year t+1 and his unvested options at the end of year t and year t+1. We group these

options by EXERPRC and EXPDATE and infer the number of newly-vesting options from the

following relationship:



      NEWLYVESTINGOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1 = UNVESTEDOPTIONNUM

(EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t + NEWLYAWARDEDOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1 -

UNVESTEDOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1,



where p and d index the exercise price and expiration date for a given option grant,

NEWLYVESTINGOPTIONNUM is the number of newly-vesting options for this exercise price-

3
  We have 53 firm-years in which we have 2 CEOs, due either to dual CEOs or a change of CEO during the year. In
these cases, the firm-year observation appears twice, once for each CEO. The results are robust to deleting these
observations or keeping the CEO with the higher incentives from newly-vesting equity.


                                                       9
expiration date pair, UNVESTEDOPTIONNUM is the number of unvested options for this pair,

and NEWLYAWARDEDOPTIONNUM is the number of newly-awarded options for this pair.

    Having identified the number of vesting securities, we then calculate their delta. The delta

measures the dollar change in the value of a security for a $1 change in the stock price, and thus

the manager’s incentive to inflate the stock price. It equals the number of shares it is equivalent

to, from an incentive standpoint. The delta of a share is 1; we calculate the delta of an option

using the Black-Scholes formula. For options that vest in year t+1, we use the risk-free rate,

volatility, expiration date, and dividend yield from Equilar, as of the end of year t. The rationale

is that, when making his investment decisions at the start of year t+1, the CEO will take into

account the delta of his options at the start of this year. If these are unavailable, we use the

inputs associated with a firm’s newly-awarded options in year t+1 from Equilar, followed by

year t’s inputs from ExecuComp (or year t+1’s if year t’s are missing), and by year t’s inputs

from Compustat (or year t+1’s if year t’s are missing), in that order.4 5

    After summing across the deltas of all of the CEO’s vesting stock and options, we multiply

the aggregate delta by the stock price at the end of year t. We call the resulting measure

“sensitivity”, and it represents the dollar change in the value of a CEO’s equity for a 1% change

in the stock price (it is equivalent to the Hall and Liebman (1998) measure of incentives). While

the delta represents the effective number of vesting shares, the sensitivity represents their




4
  As a robustness check, we use Equilar inputs in year t, followed by Execucomp inputs in year t, followed by
Compustat inputs in year t, followed by Equilar inputs in year t+1, followed by Execucomp inputs in year t+1,
followed by Compustat inputs in year t+1, in that order. The results are barely affected.
5
  If the Black-Scholes inputs cannot be located directly in any of the three databases, we fill in the missing volatility
by calculating past three-year stock price volatility using the CRSP daily files, the missing risk-free rate with the
Treasury Constant Maturity Rate with the closest term to a given option, and the missing dividend yield by
calculating the past five-year average dividend yield using the Compustat annual files, whenever data permits. If the
expiration date is missing from Equilar, we delete the option.


                                                          10
effective value. Thus, in contrast to delta, sensitivity is comparable across firms with different

stock price levels, and immune to stock splits.6

    We sum the sensitivities of newly-vesting stock (NEWLYVESTINGSTOCKt+1) and options

(NEWLYVESTINGOPTIONt+1) to create NEWLYVESTINGt+1, the total sensitivity of all newly-

vesting securities in year t+1. We similarly calculate ALREADYVESTEDSTOCKt, the sensitivity

of stock that had already vested by the end of year t, and add this to ALREADYVESTEDOPTIONt

(analogously defined) to create ALREADYVESTEDt, the sensitivity of all vested securities. We

do the same for unvested securities, to calculate the analogous variables UNVESTEDSTOCKt,

UNVESTEDOPTIONt, and UNVESTEDt.                        We then create UNVESTEDADJt, which equals

UNVESTEDt - NEWLYVESTINGt+1 and thus excludes securities that vest in year t+1; we set this

variable to zero if it is negative.7 Appendix B gives a sample calculation for one CEO-year.

    NEWLYVESTING differs from the Gopalan et al. (2013) duration measure as it is determined

by equity grants several years prior, as described in the introduction. Another difference is that

the calculation of duration requires several additional assumptions. Equilar provides information

on the vesting period of a particular equity grant, and whether the grant exhibits cliff- or graded-

vesting. However, the designation of “graded vesting” could refer to straight-line vesting (e.g., a

grant of 100 shares with a 5-year horizon vests at a rate of 20 shares per year), backloaded

vesting (e.g., 20 shares vest in year 4 and 80 shares in year 5), or frontloaded vesting. Our

NEWLYVESTING measure captures the actual (rather than expected) vesting of equity over the

current year, and thus does not require an assumption on graded vesting schedules. Calculating

6
  Several empirical studies of CEO incentives call this sensitivity measure “delta”. In option pricing, delta refers to
the dollar change in the value of an option for a $1 change in the value of the underlying share, so we use
“sensitivity” to refer to the dollar change in the value of an option for a 1% change in the underlying share.
7
  In rare cases, NEWLYVESTINGt+1 can be higher than UNVESTEDt because some unvested options have been
canceled during the year, rather than having vested. Equilar does not record such cancelations, but they are very
rare.


                                                         11
duration also requires the vesting schedule for equity granted prior to 2006, since some of this

equity will still be outstanding during our time period of 2006-10. Since vesting schedules are

unavailable pre-2006, they also need to be estimated using assumptions.8

      As our second measure of myopic incentives, we construct the ratio MMRATIO, which

equals NEWLYVESTING divided by the sum of NEWLYVESTING and UNVESTEDADJ. This

ratio measures the CEO’s concerns for the stock price over the upcoming year relative to future

years. One drawback of a ratio-based measure is that it does not take into account the amount of

vesting equity and thus the magnitude of myopic incentives. For example, if the CEO has little

unvested equity, then even a small dollar value of newly-vesting equity will lead to a large

MMRATIO even though the CEO will gain little from myopia in dollar terms. Nevertheless, we

include tests based on MMRATIO as a robustness check. Similarly, we calculate the ratio

MMRATIOALL, which equals NEWLYVESTING divided by the sum of NEWLYVESTING,

UNVESTEDADJ, and ALREADYVESTED, i.e., incentives derived from total equity holdings.


1.3    Measurement of investment

      Having chosen our measure of managerial incentives, we next decide how to measure

myopia. Theoretically, myopia is any action that increases current earnings at the expense of

long-term value, but this cost cannot be observed immediately by the market. Our first measure

is the fall in R&D ΔRD), scaled by total assets. R&D is generally expensed and thus



8
  The NEWLYVESTING measure also has its disadvantages compared to duration. In particular, it focuses on only
the equity that vests over the upcoming year, thus effectively treating a share that vests in 2 years as the same as a
share that vests in 5 years. In contrast, the duration measure takes into account all of a CEO’s equity grants and
their respective (estimated) vesting periods. Thus, the duration measure is appropriate for estimating the CEO’s
overall horizon, the goal of Gopalan et al. (2013). Focusing on newly-vesting equity is appropriate for our setting as
it is a sharper measure of incentives to act myopically in the current year. For example, consider CEO A who has 5
shares vesting in year 1 and 5 vesting in year 6; CEO B has 10 shares vesting in year 3. CEO B has a shorter overall
duration, but A likely has higher incentives to cut investment in the current year.


                                                         12
immediately reduces earnings.9 On the other hand, any value created by R&D only manifests in

the long-term, and so it is difficult for the market to observe it immediately and incorporate it in

the stock price. While many firms expense R&D separately on the income statement, and so the

market can identify if an earnings increase was caused by a cut in R&D, the income statement

can only report the level of R&D expenditure and not its quality (i.e., its impact on future cash

flows). For example, it is not clear whether a cut in R&D is due to an increase in efficiency or

myopia.10 For these reasons, prior literature finds that managers view R&D cuts as a way to

increase short-run earnings. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005) report that 80% of managers

would cut discretionary expenditure on R&D, advertising, and maintenance to meet an earnings

target. Bushee (1998) finds that investors who trade on earnings induce managers to cut R&D to

meet earnings targets. Bhojraj, Hribar, Picconi, and McInnis (2009) find that firms that beat

analyst forecasts by reducing discretionary spending (such as R&D and advertising) enjoy a

short-term increase in stock prices that is reversed in the long-run.11

    In our final sample, 2,531 firm-CEO-years (37.6% of our sample) have missing R&D,

because R&D is either included within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”)

or indeed zero. Following Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999), we set missing R&D values

to zero. As a robustness check, we remove an observation if R&D is missing and the results

(available upon request) are slightly stronger.


9
  The general rule for R&D costs under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) Rule 2 is that
they are expensed because their future economic benefits are uncertain. However, exceptions exist. Tangible assets
acquired for R&D activities that have alternative future uses can be capitalized, as can the costs of computer
software that is to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, after the technological feasibility for the product is
established.
10
   Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2013) find that “the stock market appears unable to distinguish between “good” and
“bad” R&D investment”.
11
   These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that a cut in R&D signals poor investment opportunities
(Bebchuk and Stole (1993)). Any such effect would bias our tests against finding a positive association between
R&D cuts and vesting equity.


                                                       13
   Based on similar motivation, we also include the increase in advertising expenditure in the

dependent variable, if available. Chan, Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001) provide evidence

that both advertising and R&D might be underpriced by the market, suggesting that a cut in

either expenditure could boost the short-term stock price. Since advertising expenditures are

sometimes included within SG&A, they are often missing. Therefore, we do not study them

alone but combine them with R&D to form ΔRDAD, the change in the sum of R&D and

advertising expenditures, scaled by total assets. We set missing advertising expenditures to zero,

but verify that the results are robust to removing an observation if both R&D and advertising

expenditures are missing.

   We also include the change in capital expenditure (ΔCAPEX) and total investment

(ΔCAPEXALL), scaled by total assets. While CAPEX is taken directly from the cash flow

statement, CAPEXALL is the increase in gross fixed assets from the balance sheet. The latter

represents a more comprehensive measure as it captures investment not fully reflected on the

cash flow statement, such as capitalized leases. For example, consider a firm that sells capital

and then leases it back to raise cash. CAPEXALL calculated from the balance sheet will correctly

reflect the fact that no disinvestment has occurred, since the capitalized lease will be reflected in

gross fixed assets.   However, CAPEX taken from the cash flow statement will reflect a large

reduction in investment.

   While capital expenditure is not directly expensed, it lowers earnings through raising

depreciation. In addition, it is typically financed by reducing cash or taking on additional debt.

This increases a firm’s net interest expense, reducing earnings, and also worsens the firm’s

solvency ratios (such as net debt-to-EBITDA), which may enter into market valuations. As two

additional measures, we consider the change in the sum of R&D, advertising, and capital



                                                 14
expenditure (ΔRDADCAPEX and ΔRDADCAPEXALL), which aggregates all of these

“discretionary” expenditures.

      We use “investment” as an umbrella term to encapsulate the six different measures of long-

term behavior: RD, RDAD, CAPEX, CAPEXALL, RDADCAPEX, or RDADCAPEXALL. Since

R&D and advertising have a more negative effect on current earnings, due to being fully

expensed, the first two are our primary measures of investment.


1.4     Control variables

      In addition to our measures of CEO incentives, we also include additional control variables

that may drive investment in year t+1.               We use the controls in Asker, Farre-Mensa, and

Ljungqvist (2013), plus some further controls for the firm’s investment opportunities and CEO

compensation. The first five controls proxy for investment opportunities. Qt is Tobin’s Q at the

end of year t, calculated as the market value of assets (market value of equity, plus liquidating

value of preferred stock, plus book value of debt, minus balance sheet deferred taxes and

investment tax credit) divided by the book value of assets, MVt is the log of market equity12 and

MOMENTUMt is the firm’s compounded market-adjusted monthly stock returns over the twelve

months in year t calculated from CRSP. Following Asker et al. (2013), we include Qt+1 in

addition to Qt.13 Our fifth proxy for investment opportunities is AGEt, firm age.

      The next three controls measure a firm’s capacity to finance investment. CASHt is cash and

short-term investments, BOOKLEVt is book value of short- and long-term debt, and RETEARNt

is balance-sheet retained earnings. All variables are measured at the end of year t and deflated

12
   Asker et al. (2013) match private firms with public firms on industry and size to study the difference in matched
firms’ investment behaviour, and so do not further control for size. Since matching is not relevant for our setting,
we include size as an additional control.
13
   Asker et al. (2013) show that their results are robust to using sales growth rates between year t and t+1, and t-1
and t, as an alternative proxy for growth opportunities to Qt and Qt+1. Our results are similarly robust.


                                                        15
by total assets. We also include ROAt, the return-on-assets ratio, calculated as net income

divided by average total assets in year t. This variable proxies for both investment opportunities

and the ability to finance investment. We also add SALARYt and BONUSt, two other components

of CEO compensation.


1.5     Descriptive statistics

      Summary statistics for our sample firms are in Table 1, Panel B. Our key dependent

variables are changes in investment scaled by lagged total assets. An average firm exhibits a

0.3% year-on-year change in R&D. This figure becomes 0.4% when adding advertising, and 1%

when further adding capital expenditure inferred from the balance sheet.

      The sensitivity of newly-vesting securities, NEWLYVESTING has a mean (median) of $3.6

million ($1.3 million), with a mean of $2.5 million ($1 million) coming from newly-vesting

options (shares). The sample means for MMRATIO and MMRATIOALL are 0.43 and 0.12,

respectively, and the medians are 0.39 and 0.09. The standard deviation of NEWLYVESTING is

$6.4 million and the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) is 1.8. For

comparison, this statistic is 0.7 when computed separately for each CEO and then averaged,

suggesting significant within-firm variation in the NEWLYVESTING measure.14


2     Investment

2.1     Equity vesting

      To test our hypothesis that newly-vesting equity is correlated with managerial myopia, we

run the following panel regression (omitting the firm subscript for brevity):


14
   To obtain another estimate of the within-firm variation of NEWLYVESTING, we run a regression of
NEWLYVESTING on firm fixed effects. The standard deviation of the residuals from this regression – our measure
of within-firm variation – is $3.3 million compared to the sample standard deviation of $6.4 million.


                                                     16
              ΔINVESTMENTt+1 = α + 1NEWLYVESTINGt+1 + 2UNVESTEDADJt +

                3ALREADYVESTEDt + OTHER_CONTROLSt + t,                           (1)



where ΔINVESTMENTt+1 is the change in one of the six investment variables from year t to t+1,

scaled by total assets. We measure NEWLYVESTING over year t+1, the same time period over

which ΔINVESTMENT is measured. The rationale is that, at the start of year t+1, the CEO

knows (from his contract) the amount of equity that will vest over the course of that year, and so

may cut investment accordingly. Our hypothesis is that 1 < 0, i.e., the impending vesting of

equity is associated with a fall in investment. As control variables we include UNVESTEDADJt,

ALREADYVESTEDt, and OTHER_CONTROLSt, a vector of the additional controls described in

Section 1.4. We do not have a clear prediction for the signs of 2 and 3. While unvested equity

that will not vest for several more years will likely dissuade myopia, that which will vest soon

after the upcoming year may have the opposite effect. We are unable to estimate the vesting

period of unvested equity without additional assumptions. Laux (2012) shows theoretically that

unvested equity may exacerbate myopia: the CEO takes short-term actions to avoid being fired,

since termination will lead to the forfeiture of unvested equity. While already-vested equity

could lead to short-termism since the CEO can often sell it at any time, the CEO may be

voluntarily holding already-vested equity as a long-term investment (e.g., in his family firm).

   Finally, we use firm fixed effects to control both for firm-level heterogeneity in investment

opportunities and CEO preferences towards investment (e.g., certain CEOs may be more

cautious or more overconfident than average), year fixed effects to control for common shocks to

investment opportunities, and cluster standard errors at the firm level. The inclusion of firm fixed


                                                17
effects means that our identification is based on the time-series variation in NEWLYVESTING

within a firm, which is sizable as discussed in Section 1.5.

   Table 2, Panel A presents the core result of the paper. It shows that impending vesting of

equity is significantly negatively associated with growth in five of the six investment measures –

all except CAPEX.       These results are also economically significant.       For example, an

interquartile increase in NEWLYVESTING is associated with a 0.11 percentage point decline in

ΔRD (the growth in R&D scaled by total assets), which corresponds to 37% of the average

growth in R&D scaled by total assets, 2% of the average R&D-to-assets ratio, and an average

decline in R&D of approximately $1 million per year based on the median total assets of $882m

in our sample. To our knowledge, these results are the first to link newly-vesting equity to real

investment decisions.

   The coefficient on UNVESTEDADJ is insignificant in all specifications, consistent with the

ambiguous effect of unvested equity on investment.             ALREADYVESTED is positive and

significant in two specifications, weakly consistent with the idea that managers may be holding

onto already-vested equity as a long-term investment. The control variables load with the

expected signs. Investment growth is positively related to investment opportunities, as measured

by Tobin’s Q, momentum, and negatively related to market equity and age. It is positively

related to the firm’s ability to fund investment, as measured by cash holdings, retained earnings,

and (the negative of) book leverage. The return-on-assets ratio, which may proxy for both

investment opportunities and investment, is also a positive determinant.

   One potential concern with Table 2, Panel A is that NEWLYVESTINGt+1 is correlated with

the stock price at the start of year t+1, and thus investment opportunities in year t+1. Such

correlation stems from two sources. First, NEWLYVESTING is the delta of the CEO’s vesting



                                                18
equity multiplied by the stock price at the end of year t. The multiplication by the stock price is

necessary to give an incentive measure that reflects the CEO’s wealth gain from increasing the

stock price by a given percentage (rather than dollar) amount and is thus comparable across firms

with different stock prices. Without the multiplication, our results become stronger.15 Second,

the delta of the CEO’s vesting options is itself increasing in the current stock price. As a result,

increases in the stock price both reflect improvements in investment opportunities and augment

NEWLYVESTING. Such a channel will lead to a positive correlation between NEWLYVESTING

and investment, which is the opposite of what we find. In addition, Table 2, Panel A already

includes the price-based controls Qt, Qt+1, MOMENTUMt, and MVt. In the Online Appendix, we

conduct additional robustness checks to address any residual correlation. In Table OA1, Panel A,

rather than using an option’s actual delta (which depends on the stock price), we assume a delta

of 0.7, which is the mean delta in our sample. In Panel B, we assume that all options are at-the-

money, which removes the dependence of the estimated delta on the current stock price, but still

allows for deltas to vary across firms according to volatility and other inputs. Both panels show

that the results are barely affected.

     In Table 2, Panel A, we have the level of NEWLYVESTINGt+1 on the right-hand side in

addition to firm fixed effects. The regression thus studies whether investment falls from the

previous year’s level, when the level of newly-vesting equity is high relative to the firm mean.

Alternatively, one could ask whether investment falls when the level of newly-vesting equity is

high, relative to the previous year’s level.                  In Panel B, we replace the levels of


15
   An alternative measure of incentives that is independent of the stock price would be to divide NEWLYVESTING
by the firm’s market capitalization, to give the CEO’s effective equity stake in the firm as a percentage of shares
outstanding (rather than as a dollar value), as in the Jensen and Murphy (1990) incentives measure. This measure
captures the dollar change in the CEO’s wealth for a $1 increase in firm value, and is thus not comparable across
firms of different size: a $1 increase in firm value is much less significant in a large firm than in a small firm.


                                                        19
NEWLYVESTINGt+1, UNVESTEDADJt, and ALREADYVESTEDt with ΔNEWLYVESTINGt+1,

ΔUNVESTEDADJt, and ΔALREADYVESTEDt, the changes in these variables from the previous

year. The results are very similar, with ΔNEWLYVESTINGt+1 being significantly negatively

related to the same five investment measures. We do not adopt this as the primary specification

to preserve sample size, given the already short time series of our sample.

   In Table 2, we control for UNVESTEDADJ and ALREADYVESTED by including them as

additional regressors. An alternative specification is to use them to scale the NEWLYVESTING

measure and have MMRATIO or MMRATIOALL as the key explanatory variable. As discussed

in Section 1.2, scaling provides a useful robustness check but has two potential drawbacks. First,

the scaled measures do not account for the amount of vesting equity and thus may not capture the

magnitude of CEO incentives to boost the stock price. Second, the direction of the link between

investment and UNVESTEDADJ and ALREADYVESTED is unclear. Unvested securities could

indeed reduce myopia if they vest in 5 years, but increase it if they vest in 2 years. Thus, scaling

by UNVESTEDADJ may weaken the explanatory power of NEWLYVESTING for investment.

Nevertheless, we report regressions with the scaled measures as a robustness check.

    In Table 3, Panel A, we run the following regression:



       ΔINVESTMENTt+1 = α + MMRATIOt + OTHER_CONTROLSt + t,                               (2)



   We find that MMRATIO is significantly negatively related to changes in R&D, scaled by

total assets. An interquartile increase in MMRATIO is associated with a 0.16% fall in ΔRD, 53%

of the sample mean ΔRD and 3% of the sample mean RD. This result remains significant when

adding changes in advertising but not capital expenditure to the dependent variable.            The


                                                20
findings of Table 3, when compared with Table 2, are consistent with our conjecture that a ratio

is a less precise measure of a CEO’s myopic incentives, and also with the idea that cutting R&D

and advertising are more effective ways to inflate earnings. Panel B shows similar results using

MMRATIOALL as the incentive measure. In Table OA2, Panels A-D, we show that the results

are unchanged using a delta of 0.7 or assuming that options are at-the-money. Table OA2,

Panels E-F repeat the analysis with a changes-on-changes specification and shows that they are

again little affected.

    The results of Tables 2 and 3 show a consistent negative relationship between newly-vesting

equity and various measures of investment, supporting managerial myopia theories. However,

we cannot make strong causal claims. Even though newly-vesting equity is determined by

equity granted several years prior, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that boards of directors are

able to forecast declines in investment opportunities several years in advance and schedule

vesting periods to coincide with these declines, so that the CEO cannot sell equity while

investment opportunities are strong.     Under this alternative explanation, there is no direct

causality from NEWLYVESTING to a decline in investment growth, but an omitted variable (the

expectation of future investment opportunities) causes both. This explanation requires boards to

be able to forecast investment opportunities several years in advance. We try to address this

hypothesis with a long list of controls for observable time-variation in both investment

opportunities and the ability to finance investment, firm fixed effects to control for firm-specific

time-invariant unobservable drivers of these factors, and year fixed effects to control for

aggregate time-varying unobservable drivers. However, we cannot control perfectly for factors

that are both firm-specific and time-varying. Note that this alternative explanation is also

consistent with myopia theories. If the board is deliberately timing the vesting period of equity



                                                21
to coincide with a decline in investment opportunities, such behavior is consistent with the board

recognizing that newly-vesting equity deters investment.


2.2     Equity sales

      The analysis in Section 2.1 studies the responsiveness of investment to newly-vesting equity.

A broader question is the responsiveness of investment to anticipated equity sales, which can

stem from channels other than vesting. Indeed, in the Stein (1989) model, the manager’s myopic

incentives arise because he expects to sell equity soon, but the model is ambivalent about the

cause of such sales. Anticipated equity sales could instead arise if a CEO voluntarily holds

already-vested equity as part of a long-term investment, but later decides to sell it to rebalance

his portfolio or meet an anticipated liquidity need (e.g., finance his children going to college).

However, we cannot regress investment on actual equity sales because they are endogenous.

      The choice of NEWLYVESTING as an independent variable in Section 2.1 was motivated by

two reasons. First, the amount of newly-vesting equity is determined by equity grants made

several years prior, and thus unlikely to be correlated with current investment opportunities.

Second, newly-vesting equity is likely correlated with actual sales of equity, since a risk-averse

CEO should sell a significant proportion of his equity when it vests. These two reasons are

analogous to the exogeneity and relevance criteria for a valid instrument. Therefore, we now use

NEWLYVESTING as a valid instrument for equity sales in a two-stage least squares (“2SLS”)

procedure. Since in our setting, the coefficient on the instrument is of interest in its own right,

we report the reduced form regressions in Tables 2 and 3, in addition to the structural form

regressions in Table 4 (discussed below).

      We calculate STOCKSOLD, the dollar value of the actual equity sold by the CEO, from the

Thomson Financial Insider Trading database, which is compiled from Form 4 filed with the SEC.


                                                 22
We aggregate the number of shares sold by the CEO during year t+1 and multiply the number by

his firm’s stock price at the end of year t. We classify an insider trade as “sale” if the transaction

is flagged as “Disposition” in Table 1 of Form 4.

    Table 4, Panel A shows that the sensitivity of newly-vesting equity is indeed highly

correlated with the value of equity sales. STOCKSOLD has a Pearson (Spearman) correlation of

0.377 (0.393) with NEWLYVESTING, both significant at the 1% level. Panel B presents the

results of the 2SLS regression, using NEWLYVESTING as the instrument. The left-hand side of

the panel gives the first-stage results and, consistent with Panel A, shows that our instrument

satisfies the relevance criterion: NEWLYVESTING is significantly related to STOCKSOLD at the

1% level. The right-hand side of the table presents the second-stage results. Consistent with the

results of Tables 2 and 3, the fitted value for equity sales (FIT_STOCKSOLD) is significantly

and positively associated with reductions in the same five measures of investment as Table 2,

Panel A – all except ΔCAPEX. In terms of economic significance, an interquartile increase in

STOCKSOLD is associated with a 0.25 percentage point decline in the growth of R&D scaled by

assets, 84% of the average growth of R&D scaled by assets and 4.6% of the average R&D-to-

assets ratio. Table OA3 presents the 2SLS results using a delta of 0.7 or assuming that options

are at-the-money when calculating NEWLYVESTING, which are similar.

    As with any instrumental variables approach, it is impossible to test the exclusion restriction

for the validity of an instrument and so we cannot make strong causal claims. Similar to the

results of Section 2.1, a causal interpretation requires us to believe that NEWLYVESTING is not

correlated with an omitted variable that is also linked to investment.


3   Earnings Announcements



                                                 23
3.1     Meeting or beating analyst forecasts

      If vesting equity increases the CEO’s stock price concerns, he will try particularly hard to

avoid announcing earnings per share (EPS) below analyst expectations, since doing so typically

leads to a large price drop (Skinner and Sloan (2002)). Thus, the CEO should be particularly

likely to beat the consensus forecast, either by cutting investment or by engaging in other myopic

actions, such as managing discretionary accruals. (For brevity, we use the verb “beat” to refer to

weakly beating analyst consensus, i.e., delivering earnings at or above the forecast.)

      This section therefore investigates the link between newly-vesting equity and the likelihood

that a firm beats the analyst consensus. Finding a positive link would provide further evidence –

separate to that in Section 2 – that vesting equity is correlated with managerial myopia.

Moreover, it would help distinguish between the two potential explanations for the results of

Section 2. A positive link would be consistent with managers with significant vesting equity

inflating earnings, potentially through reductions in investment, but cannot be explained by

boards designing contracts so that equity vests when investment opportunities decline.

      Figure 1 plots the frequency of the earnings surprise - the difference between reported

earnings and analyst forecasts - separately for firms with NEWLYVESTING in the top and the

bottom tercile of the sample. The number of quarters in which the reported EPS beats (misses)

the mean analyst consensus forecast is markedly higher (lower) for firms in the top

NEWLYVESTING tercile than those in the bottom tercile. The difference is greatest for earnings

announcements that beat the forecast by a small margin, consistent with the manager’s incentives

to inflate earnings being strongest when the firm is close to missing the forecast; in contrast,

earnings significantly above the forecast are more likely to reflect unexpectedly good

performance.     For example, for the bottom tercile of NEWLYVESTING, 9.5% of earnings



                                                24
announcements beat the forecast by less than one cent. This figure is 12.0% for the top tercile,

an increase of 25.8%.

    We now investigate the link between vesting equity and the likelihood of beating consensus

forecasts in a multivariate setting, running the following firm-quarter regression using quarterly

earnings announcements:

    

        BEATt+1 = α + 1NEWLYVESTINGt+1 + 2UNVESTEDADJt + 3ALREADYVESTEDt +

                              OTHER_CONTROLS2t + t,                      (3)



    The regression is estimated on a panel of quarterly earnings announcements. The dependent

variable (BEATt+1) is set to one for quarters in which the firm’s reported EPS beats the mean

analyst consensus. Analyst forecasts and reported EPS are taken from I/B/E/S. To calculate

analyst consensus, we delete stale forecasts made at least 90 days prior to the fiscal quarter end,

as is standard in the literature, and require a firm to have at least three analysts after this deletion.

For each analyst, we take the most recent forecasts before the announcement.

    We also rerun equation (3) using the dependent variables BEATBELOW1t+1, which equals 1

if the firm beats the consensus forecast by 1 cent or less, and BEATABOVE1t+1, which equals 1 if

the firm beats the consensus forecast by more than 1 cent. We predict that the link between

vesting and manipulation is especially strong for BEATBELOW1t+1.

    The key independent variable remains NEWLYVESTINGt+1. We control for the two

additional    incentive     measures       UNVESTEDADJt          and     ALREADYVESTEDt,            plus

OTHER_CONTROLS2t, a vector of additional controls previously shown to affect the likelihood

of beating earnings forecasts (e.g., Matsumoto (2002), Davis, Soo, and Trompeter (2009)). We


                                                   25
use Tobin’s Q (Q), the log of the market value of equity (MV), return on assets (ROA), and firm

age (AGE), as in the investment regressions. We also include INSTIPCT, institutional ownership

as a percentage of total shares outstanding, from Thomson’s CDA/Spectrum database (form

13F); ALY_N, the log of one plus the number of analysts covering the firm; HORIZON, the log of

one plus the mean average forecasting horizon (the number of days between an analyst forecast

date and the earnings announcement date), to measure forecast staleness; ALY_DISP, analyst

forecast dispersion, the standard deviation of analyst forecasts scaled by the absolute value of the

mean consensus forecast; and POSUE (positive seasonal unexpected earnings), a dummy

variable that equals one if the reported EPS exceeds that of the same quarter in the prior fiscal

year, and zero otherwise. We also include Fama-French 12-industry fixed effects.

   Table 5 presents the results. The first column shows that NEWLYVESTING is positively

related to the likelihood of beating analyst forecasts, and significant at the 10% level. Column

(2) shows that NEWLYVESTING is more strongly related to BEATBELOW1, the likelihood of

beating the analyst forecast by up to one cent, with the coefficient now significant at 5%. In

contrast, column (3) shows that BEATABOVE1, the likelihood of beating the forecast by above 1

cent is unrelated to NEWLYVESTING. Table OA4 in the Online Appendix repeats the analyses

of columns (2) and (3) using 2 cents and 3 cents as the cutoff, and finds similar results. Thus,

our conclusion that vesting equity is correlated with the likelihood of beating earnings forecasts

by a narrow margin but not by a wide margin, is not sensitive to our margin definition.

   A potential alternative explanation for our results is reverse causality.         Some of the

manager’s equity may exhibit performance-based vesting, and good earnings announcements




                                                26
may cause the stock price to rise and trigger performance-based vesting conditions.16 Gopalan et

al. (2013) report that 35.3% of stock in the Equilar dataset exhibits performance-based vesting,

compared with only 1.9% of options. Thus, the concern is significant for stock but not options.

The summary statistics of Table 1, Panel B show that the mean (median) value of newly-vesting

options is over 2.5 (5) times larger than the median value of newly-vesting stock.                              Thus,

NEWLYVESTING is predominantly comprised of options, for which performance-based vesting

is rare. Columns (4) and (5) of Table 5 provides a more systematic evaluation of this alternative

explanation. It replaces NEWLYVESTING with the separate variables NEWLYVESTINGSTOCK

and NEWLYVESTINGOPTION. Column (4) shows that newly-vesting equity is insignificantly

related to the likelihood of beating analyst consensus by 1 cent, but newly-vesting options are

significantly positive (albeit at the 10% level, as they only capture part of the CEO’s myopic

incentives).     Thus, the positive relationship between vesting equity and narrowly beating

earnings targets is not driven by performance-vesting stock. Finally, consistent with the earlier

results, column (5) shows that BEATABOVE1 is unrelated to both components of vesting equity.

     Overall, the results of Table 5 show that vesting equity is positively associated with narrowly

beating earnings forecasts, supporting the hypothesis that vesting causes managers to act

myopically. While the tests do not prove that this causal effect drives the results in Section 2,

they do narrow the range of admissible alternative explanations.                            Any one non-causal

explanation would also have to explain why vesting equity is correlated not only with falls in

investment but also with narrowly beating earnings forecasts.


16
  Note that performance-based vesting is not a plausible explanation for the investment results in Tables 2-4
because it suggests a positive relation between vesting and investment, contrary to our findings. Performance-based
vesting is triggered after high stock returns, when investment opportunities are also likely to be high. (Moreover, all
regressions in Tables 2-4 control for stock returns directly.) See Bettis, Bizjak, Coles, and Kalpathy (2010) for a
systematic study of equity with performance-based vesting.

3.2     Market reaction to earnings announcements

      The results of the paper thus far show that managers with significant vesting equity are more

likely to reduce investment and narrowly beat earnings forecasts. We finally study the separate

question of whether the market rationally takes into account such managers’ myopic tendencies.

In the Stein (1989) “signal-jamming” equilibrium, myopic managers cut investment to increase

earnings in an attempt to inflate the stock price, but the market rationally discounts reported

earnings and all firms are efficiently priced. Even though managers do not succeed in inflating

the stock price, they remain trapped into engaging in myopia as the market discounts whatever

earnings they report – thus, if they did not inflate earnings, the earnings would still be discounted

and the firm would be underpriced. Hence, the market is efficient and managers inefficiently

underinvest. An alternative scenario is where the market does not take into account managers’

myopic tendencies – either because it lacks information on the manager’s incentives, or because

it has information but is inefficient – and so does not discount reported earnings.

      We distinguish between these two scenarios by studying how the market’s reaction to

earnings announcements depends on the level of vesting equity. It is well-established that the

market reaction to an earnings announcement is increasing in the surprise, with a discontinuity at

zero: beating the forecast leads to a markedly higher reaction than missing it (Bartov, Givoly,

and Hayn (2002)).       We study whether, controlling for the earnings surprise, the market’s

response is less positive for CEOs with significant vesting equity, because it places a probability

that such CEOs have inflated their earnings. We run the following regression:




                                                 28
       CARt+1 = α + 1NEWLYVESTINGt+1 + 2UNVESTEDADJt + 3ALREADYVESTEDt +

    BEATt+1+ NEWLYVESTINGt+1×BEATt+1+DIFt+1 + OTHER_CONTROLS3t + t, (4)



   CARt+1 is the (-1, +1) three-day market-adjusted return to a quarterly earnings announcement

in year t+1, which is also the year for which we measure vesting equity (NEWLYVESTINGt+1).

In our previous regressions, the dependent variable was a t+1 decision affected by the manager,

such as investment or earnings, and the manager knows NEWLYVESTINGt+1 at the time of his

decision since he observes his own contract. Here, it is investors who determine announcement

returns, and they will typically be unable to calculate NEWLYVESTINGt+1 using our

methodology until the year t+1 proxy statement is disclosed. FAS 123R only requires firms to

disclose the proportions of an individual equity grant that are vested and unvested, but not the

vesting schedule of unvested equity. However, in some cases, firms voluntarily disclose the

precise vesting schedule of each equity grant in their proxy filings – i.e., the filings contain

additional information not in Equilar – so that the market can calculate NEWLYVESTINGt+1

accurately before the beginning of year t+1. For firms that only disclose the required minimum,

the market can estimate NEWLYVESTINGt+1 from previous proxy statements using certain

assumptions (see Gopalan et al. (2013) for a possible methodology). To account for this, we

divide the equity variables NEWLYVESTINGt+1, UNVESTEDADJt, and ALREADYVESTEDt into

terciles and use the ranks instead of the raw variables in the regressions. This specification

assumes that the market can estimate which tercile of vesting equity a firm will fall into, even

though it may be unable to predict exactly where within a tercile it will fall. Our results remain

robust to using quintiles or deciles.




                                               29
   The regressions also include the same BEATt+1 dummy variable used earlier, which in some

specifications we interact with NEWLYVESTINGt+1, and DIFt+1, the earnings surprise (difference

between the actual and forecast earnings). OTHER_CONTROLS3 is a vector of control variables

previously shown to be correlated with announcement returns, taken predominantly from Savor

and Wilson (2011). LEVERAGE is the ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt and book

equity. PASTRET(1Y) is the cumulative monthly industry-adjusted return over the year prior to

the announcement and PASTRET(1M) is the industry-adjusted return in the month prior to the

announcement. We include FYE, a dummy variable for the last quarter of a fiscal year, because

the Q4 earnings announcement sometimes coincides with the release of a proxy statement. We

include ANNRET(LAG1), ANNRET(LAG2), ANNRET(LAG3), and ANNRET(LAG4), earnings

announcement returns for quarters -1 to -4 relative to the current quarter, to control for serial

correlation in announcement returns (Abarbanell and Bernard (1992)). We include industry

fixed effects and cluster standard errors by announcement day.

   Table 6 presents the results. Column (1) omits the explanatory variables involving BEAT and

DIF, i.e., does not control for the magnitude of the earnings announcement. NEWLYVESTING is

negative and insignificant, suggesting that the market does not respond more positively to

earnings announcements from CEOs with more vesting equity. In combination with Table 5,

column (1) suggests that, while such CEOs are more likely to report earnings at or above analyst

expectations, the market does not respond any more favorably to such reports, potentially

because it expects that they have been inflated. Column (2) adds BEAT and DIF as additional

regressors, to control for the actual announcement. Consistent with the literature, BEAT is

positive and highly significant.   However, NEWLYVESTING is now significantly negative:

holding constant the earnings surprise, the market responds less positively to the earnings



                                               30
announcement if the CEO has significant newly-vesting equity, suggesting a higher perceived

probability that the earnings have been inflated. Increasing the NEWLYVESTING tercile rank by

one lowers the earnings announcement return by 0.28 percentage points.

   Column (3) adds an interaction term between BEAT and NEWLYVESTING. This interaction

term is significantly negative. Thus, the negative association between NEWLYVESTING and

announcement returns documented in column (2) is driven by quarters in which earnings exceed

the analyst forecast, consistent with the market expecting more earnings inflation when earnings

surprises are positive. Increasing the NEWLYVESTING tercile rank by one lowers the market

response to beating a forecast by 1.22 percentage points, versus the average response of 2.46%.

   It is interesting to note that the coefficient on NEWLYVESTING is now positive. It implies

that increasing the NEWLYVESTING tercile by one mitigates the negative reaction to missing an

earnings forecast by 0.5 percentage points compared to the baseline of -3.6%. One potential

interpretation is that the market infers that the manager has not inflated earnings, despite his

myopic incentives, and that this inference mitigates the negative response to missing the

analysts’ forecast.

   In sum, we find that, although managers with more vesting equity are more likely to beat

earnings forecasts, doing so does not lead to a more positive market response on average.

Controlling for the earnings surprise, the announcement returns are lower for higher newly-

vesting equity, especially in quarters in which earnings exceed the forecast. These findings

suggest that the stock market recognizes managers’ incentives to inflate earnings when a

significant amount of their equity vests.

4   Conclusion

    This paper studies the link between equity vesting and real investment decisions.           We

construct a new empirical measure of a CEO’s myopic incentives that corresponds closely to

managerial myopia theories: the sensitivity of equity vesting over the next year. This measure

contrasts standard measures of CEO incentives which gauge the manager’s sensitivity to the

stock price, but do not consider the horizon. We demonstrate that newly-vesting equity is

significantly negatively related to R&D, and the results remain significant when including other

discretionary spending such as advertising and capital expenditure. We also use newly-vesting

equity as an instrument to estimate the responsiveness of investment to anticipated stock sales in

general.

    Vesting equity is positively related to the likelihood of beating analysts’ quarterly earnings

forecasts. However, the market responds less positively to beating analyst consensus if the

manager has significant vesting equity, implying that it takes his myopic incentives into account.

Thus, such managers do not enjoy higher announcement returns overall. In sum, our results

show that the horizon of managerial incentives is associated with myopia: managers with newly-

vesting equity are more likely to cut investment, potentially to meet short-term earnings targets.

    While we have shown that investment is negatively related to newly-vesting equity, we have

not shown that the reduction in investment is inefficient. It may be that managers always

overinvest due to empire-building tendencies, and so the fall in investment brings it closer to the

optimal level. Laux (2012) shows that short-term projects may be optimal as they provide early

feedback on CEO quality and guide interim replacement decisions. Even if the reduction in

investment induced by the CEO’s contract is inefficient, this does not mean that his contract is

inefficient overall.   Boards of directors may recognize that short-vesting equity leads to



                                                32
underinvestment, but trade this off against the costs of long-vesting equity. For example, long-

vesting equity exposes the manager to risks outside his control, and causes him to demand a risk

premium.

   More generally, our measure of myopic incentives, the sensitivity of stock and options

vesting over the upcoming year, is relatively easy to construct, and potentially usable in wider

contexts than investment decisions. For future research, it would be interesting to study whether

it is linked to other examples of myopic behavior.

Appendix B: A numerical example
This appendix illustrates the calculation steps to derive equity incentives for one CEO in our
sample, along with the company’s disclosure tables retrieved from Equilar for the two fiscal
years on which the calculations are based. As an example, we use James McCann, CEO of 1-
800 Flowers.com, Inc. and calculate the stock price sensitivity of his newly-vesting securities for
the fiscal year ended on June 30th, 2009 (NEWLYVESTING), that of his unvested securities for
the fiscal year ended on June 30th, 2008 (UNVESTED), and that of his already-vested securities
for the fiscal year ended on June 30th, 2008 (ALREADYVESTED).
First, we obtain option data from Equilar for James McCann:

    To calculate the number of newly-vesting options for fiscal year 2009 and unvested/already-
vested options at the end of fiscal year 2008, we match and group the outstanding options by
exercise price (EXERPRC) and expiration date (EXPDATE). We then infer the number of newly-
vesting options from the following relationship:




                                                     37
  NEWLYVESTINGOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1 = UNVESTEDOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t +
NEWLYAWARDEDOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1 - UNVESTEDOPTIONNUM (EXERPRCp, EXPDATEd)t+1

After identifying the number of newly-vesting, unvested, and already-vested securities, we then input into the Black-Scholes formula
the risk-free rate, volatility, and dividend yield from Equilar and calculate each option’s delta, grant-by-grant. The risk-free rate is not
available for fiscal year 2008, so we replace it with the risk-free rate of 0.027 from fiscal year 2009. Similarly, we replace the missing
volatility and dividend yield for fiscal year 2008 with the volatility of 0.7237 and the dividend yield of 0 from fiscal year 2009.

To calculate the price-sensitivity measures of options, we multiply the deltas calculated above by the closing stock price of $6.45 at
the end of fiscal year 2008. James McCann’s NEWLYVESTINGOPTION during fiscal year 2009 is therefore calculated as 16,646 ×
6.45 = 107,366.7, and his UNVESTEDOPTION and ALREADYVESTEDOPTION at the end of fiscal year 2008 as 41,874 × 6.45 =
270,087.3 and 544,714 × 6.45 = 3,513,405.3, respectively.



                                                                       38
Second, we obtain share data from Equilar for James McCann:

To calculate the price-sensitivity measures of shares, we multiply the number of shares above by the closing stock price of $6.45 at the
fiscal year end of 2008. James McCann’s NEWLYVESTINGSTOCK during fiscal year 2009 is therefore calculated as 67,434 × 6.45 =
434,949.3, and his UNVESTEDSTOCK and ALREADYVESTEDSTOCK at the end of fiscal year 2008 as 310,677 × 6.45 = 2,003,866.65
and 35,982,819 × 6.45 = 232,089,182.55, respectively.

Finally, we sum the sensitivity measures of options and shares to construct the variables used in the main specification,
NEWLYVESTING, UNVESTEDADJ, ALREADYVESTED, MMRATIO, and MMRATIOALL.

This panel reports the OLS regression results on the relationship between the CEO’s vesting equity and
investment. Variable definitions are listed in Appendix A. NEWLYVESTING, UNVESTEDADJ, and
ALREADYVESTED are in billions, and SALARY and BONUS are in ten millions. The prefix Δ denotes the
change from year t-1 to t for variables with subscript t and from year t to t+1 for variables with subscript t+1.
Standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for heteroskedasticity and clustered by firm. Year and firm fixed
effects are included in all columns. *** (**) (*) indicates significance at the 1% (5%) (10%) two-tailed level,
respectively.

This panel reports the 2SLS regression results on the relationship between CEO equity sales and investment,
using NEWLYVESTING as an instrumental variable for STOCKSOLD. Column (1) presents the first-stage
regression results, and columns (2.1)-(2.6) present the second-stage regression results for the six different
investment measures. Variable definitions are listed in Appendix A. FIT_STOCKSOLD is the fitted value of
STOCKSOLD from the first-stage regressions. STOCKSOLD, NEWLYVESTING, UNVESTEDADJ, and
ALREADYVESTED are in billions, and SALARY and BONUS are in ten millions. Standard errors are in
parentheses, adjusted for heteroskedasticity and clustered by firm. Year and firm fixed effects are included in
all columns. *** (**) (*) indicates significance at the 1% (5%) (10%) two-tailed level, respectively.

This panel reports the probit regression results on the relationship between the CEO’s vesting equity and
the likelihood of beating the quarterly analyst consensus forecast. Variable definitions are listed in
Appendix A. NEWLYVESTING, NEWLYVESTINGSTOCK, NEWLYVESTINGOPTION, UNVESTEDADJ,
and ALREADYVESTED are in billions. Standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for heteroskedasticity
and clustered by firm. For NEWLYVESTING, NEWLYVESTINGSTOCK, and NEWLYVESTINGOPTION,
the marginal effects (dF/dx) are displayed below the standard errors. Year and industry fixed effects are
included in all columns but the coefficient estimates are not reported. *** (**) (*) indicates significance at
the 1% (5%) (10%) two-tailed level, respectively.
