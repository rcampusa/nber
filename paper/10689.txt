This paper makes indirect inference about the time-variation in expected stock returns by comparing

unconditional sample variances to estimates of expected conditional variances. The evidence reveals

more predictability as more information is used, and no evidence that predictability has diminished

in recent years. Semi-strong form evidence suggests that time-variation in expected returns remains

            Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited

_________________________________________________________________________

1. Introduction
The empirical evidence for predictability in common stock returns remains

ambiguous, even after many years of research. This paper makes indirect inference

about the time-variation in expected stock returns by comparing unconditional

sample variances of returns to estimates of expected conditional variances. The key

to our approach is a sum-of-squares decomposition:


                       Var{R} = E{Var (R Ω)} + Var{E(R Ω)},                              (1)



where R is the rate of return of a stock and Ω is the public information set. E(.| Ω )

and Var(.| Ω ) are the conditional mean and variance and Var{.} and E{.}, without the

conditioning notation, are the unconditional moments. We are interested in the term

Var{ E(R| Ω ) }; that is, the amount of variation through time in conditionally

expected stock returns. We infer this quantity by subtracting estimates of the

expected conditional variance from estimates of the unconditional variance. We

focus on the predictability in monthly stock returns. This is motivated by the

empirical literature on asset pricing, which most commonly studies monthly returns.

        We use two approaches to estimate the average conditional variances. These

correspond to the classical description of increasing market information sets

described by Fama (1970). Weak-form information considers only the information

contained in past stock prices. This analysis, summarized in Table 1, builds on a

comparison of daily and monthly sample variances, and is related to the variance

ratios studied by Lo and MacKinlay (1988) and others. Semi-strong form information

relates to other lagged variables that are clearly publicly available. Our analysis uses




                                                                                           2

regressions for individual stock returns, on lagged firm-specific characteristics. Our

approach is unique in that it relies on the covariation of the predictable components

of individual stocks to draw inferences about index predictability. These results are

reported in Table 2.
        Studies of predictability in stock index returns typically report regressions

with small R-squares, as the fraction of the variance in returns that can be predicted

with lagged variables is small. The R-squares are larger for longer-horizon returns,

because expected returns are considered to be more persistent than returns

themselves.1 However, because stock returns are very volatile, small R-squares can

mask economically important variation in the expected returns. Stocks are long

"duration" assets, so a small change in the expected return can lead to a large

fluctuation in the asset value. To illustrate, consider the simple Gordon (1962)

constant-growth model for a stock price: P = kE/(r-g), where P is the stock price, E is

the earnings per share, k is the dividend payout ratio, g is the future growth rate of

earnings and r is the discount rate. The discount rate is the required or expected

return of the stock. Consider an example where the price/earnings ratio, P/E = 15,

the payout ratio, k = 0.6, and the expected growth rate, g = 3%. The expected return

is 7%. Suppose there is a shock to the expected return, ceteris paribus. In this

example a change of one percent in r leads to approximately a 20% change in the

asset value.

        Of course, it is unrealistic to hold everything else fixed, but the example

   1Thus, the variance of the expected returns accumulates with longer horizons faster
 than the variance of returns, and the R-squares increase (see, e.g. Fama and French,
 1988, 1989).

suggests that small changes in expected returns can produce large and economically

significant changes in asset values. Consistent with this argument, studies such as

Kandel and Stambaugh (1996), Campbell and Viceira (2001) and Fleming, Kirby and

Ostdiek (2001) show that optimal portfolio decisions can be affected to an
economically significant degree by return predictability, even when the amount of

predictability, as measured by R-squared, is small. Generalizing the Gordon model

to allow for changes in growth rates, Campbell (1991) estimates that changes in

expected returns through time may account for half of the variance of equity index

values.

           Our weak-form tests find no reliable evidence of predictability in modern

data. Even so, a simulation study shows that the tests have the power to detect

modest amounts of predictability. On the other hand, our semi-strong form tests find

small but statistically and economically significant predictability. In contrast to

recent studies that rely on aggregate predictor variables, we find no evidence that the

predictability has diminished over time.

           The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our

approaches to measuring the variance of conditional expected stock returns. Section

3 presents the data and main results. Section 4 studies the power of our approach

using simulations and the robustness of our empirical findings. Conclusions are

offered in Section 5. Two Appendices discuss data, estimation issues and technical

details.

2. Measuring Average Conditional Variances
2.1. Weak Form Information
Equation (1) says that we can estimate the variance of conditional expected stock

returns by first estimating the unconditional variance and then subtracting an

estimate of the average conditional variance. Thus, in order to use Equation (1) we

need to estimate the average variance of the returns around the conditional mean,

E{Var(R| Ω )} = E{[R-E(R| Ω )]2}. The problem is that we don't know the conditional
mean, E(R| Ω ). Our approach in this section follows Merton (1980), who showed

that while the mean of a stock return is hard to estimate, it is nearly irrelevant for

estimating the conditional variance, when the time between observations is short.

We use high frequency returns to estimate the conditional variance, subtract its

average from the monthly unconditional variance, and the difference -- according to

Equation (1) -- is the variance of the monthly conditional mean.

        Nelson (1990, 1992) further develops Merton's idea. Suppose that the stock

value can be approximated by a continuous process formed as a step function, with

time intervals of length h between the steps. Take the interval [T-h,T), chop it into D

pieces, and consider the average of the D squared log price changes as an estimator

for the conditional variance of the returns over the interval. Nelson proves the

estimator is consistent, in the sense that it approaches the conditional variance in the

"continuous record" limit, as h approaches zero and D becomes infinite. The

intuition is that for small h, the conditional mean is effectively constant, so the

sample variance approaches the conditional variance as D grows. By similar logic,

Nelson (1992) shows that misspecification of the conditional mean function washes

out as h gets small.




                                                                                           5

_________________________________________________________________________


        Evidence from Nelson (1991) supports the idea that for monthly stock

returns, chopping the month into days should work well. He finds that daily returns

measured with versus without dividends, or with versus without a simple

adjustment for risk-free interest rates, produce virtually the same estimates of
conditional variances. Similarly, Schwert (1990) finds that different dividend series

have almost no effect on the measured daily variances of a long historical stock

return series that we use in our analysis.

        We estimate E{Var(R| Ω )} by the time series average of the daily return

variances for each month. Using monthly returns data, we estimate the

unconditional variance, Var(R). Then, we infer the variance of the conditional

expected returns by Equation (1). Let the return for month m be Rm = ln(Vm/Vm-1)
= Σ j∈m ∆ j , where Vm is the value of the stock at time m and ∆ j is the daily log value

change for day j. Assume that the conditional mean for month m is
µ m = E(Σ j ∆ j j ∈ m), with E(∆j|j ∈ m) = µ m /D, D being the number of days in the

month. The unconditional mean monthly return is E( µ m ) = µ , and we are interested

in Var( µ m ), the variance of the monthly expected returns. Define the average daily
variance, ADV = E{E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)2| j∈ m ]}, and the unconditional monthly variance,

MV = E{(Rm - µ )2}. Simple calculations show that Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV).

        The model sketched above uses the approximation that the means shift

monthly, while daily returns fluctuate independently around the conditional means.

However, there is weak serial dependence in daily stock returns. The question is

whether or not to attribute this serial dependence to changes in the conditional

expected return.

        On the one hand, much of the literature on predictability allows that serial




                                                                                            6

_________________________________________________________________________


dependence may reflect changing conditional means. Fama and French (1988) use

rate-of-return autoregressions to study predictability. Lo and MacKinlay (1988) and

Conrad and Kaul (1988) model expected returns within the month as autoregressive

processes. On the other hand, serial dependence in daily returns can arise from end-
of-day price quotes that fluctuate between bid and ask (Roll, 1984) or from

nonsynchronous trading of the stocks in an index. These effects should not be

attributed to time-variation in the expected discount rate for stocks. We estimate
Var( µ m ) with and without adjustments for serial dependence. To illustrate the
adjustment, let θ = E{ E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)( ∆ j′ - µ m /D)| j, j′ ∈ m , |j-j'|=1] }. Assuming that

the first order daily serial dependence reflects market microstructure effects
unrelated to discount rates, we estimate Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV + 2 θ ).

         In the Appendix B we describe how the calculations are adjusted to obtain

unbiased estimators in finite samples. Biases in the finite sample variances and

autocovariances arise due to estimation error in the sample means. In addition, there

is a "finite record" bias, which arises because h>0 and D<∞. To address these biases
we use Monte Carlo simulations. The calculations described above do not impose

the requirement that variance estimates can't be negative. The Appendix B also

describes how this restriction is imposed. Section 4 further explores the power and

robustness of the methods.



2.2. Semi-strong Form Information: Using Individual Stock Regressions
Much of the empirical literature on asset-return predictability uses regressions of

stock-index returns on lagged, market-wide information variables. This approach

raises two types of concerns. First, there are statistical problems associated with the




                                                                                               7

_________________________________________________________________________


regressions, especially when the data are heteroskedastic, the right-hand side

variables are highly persistent or the left-hand side returns are overlapping in time.2

The second issue is data mining. If the lagged variables arise from many researchers

sifting through the same data sets, there is a risk of finding spurious predictability

(Lo and MacKinlay 1990; Foster, Smith and Whaley 1997).

        We use individual stocks to estimate the sum-of-squares decomposition in

Equation (1), focusing on the aggregate predictability. Basic portfolio theory implies

that individual-stock expected returns teach us about index predictability, only to the

extent that they are correlated across the stocks. Consider the N x N covariance

matrix of the conditional mean returns for N stocks, Cov{E(R|Z)}, where Z stands

for the lagged, public information regressors. Letting 1 be an N-vector of ones, the
variance of the conditional expected returns on an equally-weighted portfolio, Rp is:



                       Var{E(Rp|Z)} = (1/N2) 1'Cov{E(R|Z)}1.                             (2)



Since there are N(N-1) covariance terms, but only N variances in this expression, the

expected return variance for the portfolio approaches the average of the firms'

expected return covariances, while the individual stock predictability vanishes as N

gets large.

        To estimate the predictability of the index we model Cov{E(R|Z)} from

individual-stock regressions on lagged, firm-specific variables. We use Monte Carlo

methods to handle the statistical issues, as described in Appendix B. There is some

correlation between our firm-specific variables and the instruments selected in

previous studies of aggregate predictability, so we are not completely immune to

data mining bias. However, our measure does not rely on the direct index
predictability that so many previous studies have explored, and the number of

studies that examine individual-stock return predictability with time-series

regressions is still relatively small. Using only firm-specific instruments we probably

understate the correlations among the expected returns. If we use market-wide

instruments for individual stocks, we are likely to overstate the correlations.

Comparing the two cases we estimate a range of plausible values.


3. Empirical Results
3.1. Results using Weak-form Information
Table 1 presents estimates of predictability based on the comparison of monthly and

daily return variances. Appendix A describes the data. Panel A presents results for

the Standard and Poor's index over different subsamples and Panel B summarizes

the results for the individual common stocks of twenty six large firms. Three
estimators of predictability are shown. The estimator denoted as σ(µ m ) includes no
adjustment for daily serial dependence, while the estimator σ(µ m ) ∗ adjusts for any

first order autocorrelation, taking the view that daily serial correlation reflects

microstructure issues unrelated to changes in discount rates. The estimator
σ(µ m ) # takes the view that -- for individual stocks -- the main microstructure effect is

the bid-ask bounce, which produces negative autocorrelation. Thus, negative

autocorrelations are removed each month from the predictability calculation while




                                                                                              9

no adjustment is made for positive ones. (The average autocorrelation parameter, θ ,

taken over the months is positive for the Standard and Poor's 500 index, and negative

for 16 of the 26 firms.) For comparison, the second column contains the

unconditional standard deviations of the monthly returns, expressed as annual

percentages.3

        We first discuss the estimates in columns 3-5, labeled GMM estimates. These

are the three estimates with analytical adjustments for finite sample biases, as

derived in Appendix B.4 The estimates of predictability for the stock index range
from 1.9% to 5.4% using Schwert's (1990) data for the 1885-1962 period. However,

over the 1962-2001 period where the CRSP daily data are available, the estimated
volatility of the expected returns is 2% using either σ(µ m ) or σ(µ m ) # . After adjusting

for positive serial dependence, which may arise from nonsynchronous trading of the
stocks in the index, the estimator σ(µ m ) ∗ delivers a value of zero. Over the most

recent 120 months of the sample all of the estimates of predictability are zero.

        We estimate the finite sample biases in the predictability estimates using

simulations. The simulations also provide empirical p-values for assessing the

statistical significance of the results.5 The adjusted estimates are shown in columns

   3The monthly variance is multiplied by 12, then the square root of this result is
 multiplied by 100. All of the numbers in the tables are annualized this way.
   4 We also examine results using the estimators without the analytical adjustments for
 finite sample biases. When we rely on the simulations described below to control the
 finite sample biases, the results are similar.
   5  We resample from the actual data for a given stock or index, randomly with
 replacement. For each simulation trial we generate an artificial time series with the
 same number of daily observations as the original data series. The artificial data satisfy
 the null hypothesis that the expected return is constant. We compute the estimators on




                                                                                          10

6-8 of Table 1. They tell a similar story. The estimates for the index range from zero

to 5.1% for the 1885-1962 period, and the larger figures appear statistically

significant. However, using CRSP data for 1962-2001, the estimates are 1.44% or less,

and none are statistically significant. Over the last 120 months the adjusted estimates
are all equal to zero.

        Panel B summarizes results for a sample of 26 large firms' individual

common stocks. These cover the post-1962 period where CRSP daily data are

available. Averaged across the stocks, the predictability estimates range from zero to

2.2%, depending on the choice of estimator and sample period. The empirical p-

values range from 0.23 to 0.35, thus providing no evidence of predictability. Even the

extreme cases present no reliable evidence of predictability. Taking the stock with
the maximum value of σ(µ m ) , its empirical p-value is 0.07 or 0.08, depending on the

subperiod. Accounting for the fact that this is the maximum of 26 cases, the results

are insignificant.6

 the artificial sample in exactly the same way as on the original samples. We repeat this
 for 1,000 trials. The average across the trials is the expected finite sample bias. We use
 the distribution of the simulated estimates to generate empirical p-values. These are the
 fraction of the simulations where the variance estimates are larger than the sample
 values. A small p-value means that the sample estimate is unlikely to occur if expected
 returns are constant.
   6Let ui be the empirical p-value for the i-th experiment, i=1,...,n. Under the null
 hypothesis of no predictability the empirical p-value is uniformly distributed on [0,1].
 Assuming independent experiments,

 Prob{Mini ui ≤ q}       = 1 - Prob{ui>q; i=1,...,n}
                         = 1 - Π i Prob{ui>q}
                         = 1 - (1-q)n.

 For q=0.07 and n=26, the probability of finding the minimum p-value to be 0.07 or




                                                                                       11

_________________________________________________________________________


        In summary, while the older historical data suggests economically significant

predictability in the market index, there is little evidence of weak-form predictability

in modern data. In particular, the evidence for the most recent ten years suggests

that any weak-form predictability in the index has vanished.7



3.2. Semi-Strong Form Tests
        Table 2 presents our estimates of predictability based on the covariances of

individual stock regressions on lagged variables. The regressions use monthly data

from 1969 through 2001 and twenty large firms' common stocks. We estimate

predictability for an equally weighted portfolio. The data are described in Appendix

A. The three rows for each sample period contain sample values of the implied

predictability using either all the elements of the covariance matrix of the fitted

expected returns, the off-diagonal elements only, or the diagonal elements only.

Excluding the diagonals provides some information on what would be expected to

happen as the number of similar stocks used in the calculation becomes large.

Excluding the diagonals and using firm-specific regressors, the first column of

figures shows that the implied predictability estimates fall in a narrow range, from

2.37% to 2.67%, depending on the subperiod.


 smaller in 26 trials is 85%. Of course, the trials are not independent, so the correct
 probability is somewhere between 7% and 85%.
   7 Lo and MacKinlay (1999) present weak form tests with less evidence for
 predictability in more recent data, and suggest that the demise of such predictability
 may be related to "statistical arbitrage" trading by Wall Street firms. Nelson and Kim
 (1993) also find that weak-form evidence for stock index predictability is thin in post
 World War II data.




                                                                                       12

        The regressions behind Table 2 are subject to statistical biases, which we

control via simulation as discussed in Appendix B. The bias-adjusted estimates are

summarized in the second column of figures. Using only off-diagonal terms, the

estimates are 1.63% to 1.84% annualized. Using the full covariance the figures are
2.41% to 2.59%. These estimates are statistically significant according to the empirical

p-values.

        It is interesting that the measures of predictability based on the diagonals

only, as summarized in the third row, behave differently from estimates emphasizing

the off diagonal terms. The diagonal-only estimates are numerically larger but not

significantly different from zero; their right-tail p-values are larger than 20% in each

experiment. This reflects the relatively large sampling variability of the regression

estimates of expected returns, compared with their relatively small sampling

covariability. This is one of the advantages of our approach, compared with

previous studies that rely on direct regressions of stock indexes on lagged variables.

Because the sampling covariability of the expected returns with firm-specific lagged

variables is relatively small, we are able to estimate the predictability with relatively

high precision. Thus, based on the covariability, we can say that 1.8% to 2.6% is

strongly statistically significant.

        The estimates of predictability in Table 2 emphasizing the off diagonals, are

similar whether we use the full sample or concentrate on subsamples of the last 120

months or the most recent 60 months.8 This is interesting in view of recent empirical

 predictor, a measure of the firm's dividend yield. The results with this additional

studies that find index predictability, measured directly using lagged variables, has

weakened in recent samples. It may be that the predictability was "real" when first

publicized, but diminished as traders attempted to exploit it.9 Alternatively, the

predictability may have been spurious in the first place, as a result of statistical biases

and/or naive data mining. If the predictability is spurious we would expect lagged

instruments to appear in the empirical literature, then fail to work with fresh data

(e.g., Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin, 2003). But Table 2 presents no evidence that

predictability is weaker in the recent subperiods.

          As our firm-instrument-only measures do not rely on aggregate predictor

variables, Table 2 provides new and interesting evidence that the underlying

predictability has not diminished. This is consistent with the "efficient markets' view

of predictability, as reflected in much of the conditional asset pricing literature (see

reviews by Ferson (1985) and Cochrane, 2001). According to this view returns may

be predictable if required expected returns vary over time in association with

changing risk or risk aversion. If required expected returns vary over time there may

be no abnormal trading profits and thus, no incentive to exploit the predictability.

Predictability may therefore persist in an efficient market.

          The two right-hand columns of Table 2 show predictability estimates when

each regression uses both firm-specific and market index ("Macro") characteristics as

the lagged regressors, or alternatively, when only the Macro variables are used.

These calculations show the effects of using the economy-wide lagged regressors.

sample period are between 4.2% and 8.6%, depending on whether or not we exclude

the diagonals from the calculation, and even higher when we focus on the diagonals

alone. The economy-wide regressors increase the covariability of the expected return

estimates. The "Macro only" examples in the far right column suggest that
predictability is diminished somewhat in the more recent subperiods, which is

consistent with the evidence cited earlier in studies that rely on economy-wide

regressors.

        Our semi-strong form estimates of predictability provide more reliable

evidence of time-variation in monthly stock returns than our weak-form tests. This is

expected if returns are more easily predicted using more information. But is 2-3% on

an annual basis an economically significant effect? The simple Gordon model

example from the introduction provides an illustration. Consider a month in which

the required expected return jumps by roughly two standard deviations, say from 7%

to 11%. Other things held fixed, the stock price would fall to half of its former value

in response. Of course, this overstates the effect, to the extent that a shock that

changes the required return also changes the expected cash flows and future growth

rates, but the example suggests the economic significance of predictability.


4. Power and Robustness
This section presents some results on the statistical power of our methods and on the

robustness of our empirical findings. Concerns about power focus on the weak-form

tests where we do not find significant predictability. Our approach contains several

steps where approximations are introduced or estimation is required. Each step is

prone to some error, and the cumulative effect of the errors may result in low power.




                                                                                      15

             Weak and Semi-strong Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited

_________________________________________________________________________


To evaluate the power we use simulations that include each of the steps. We also

compare various estimators to isolate the impact of the different steps on power.

        In the simulations we generate data following the model described in Section

2.1. The conditional means fluctuate each month as draws from a normal
distribution, whose standard deviation controls the amount of variation in the

expected returns. Daily returns fluctuate randomly around the monthly means, with

variances chosen so that the first and second moments of the simulated returns

match the sample returns. By setting the expected return variation to equal zero, we

get critical values for a 5% test, defined such that 5% of the simulations produce

statistics larger than the critical value. Setting the expected return variation to larger

values, we trace out the power curves illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The power of a

particular test is the fraction of the simulation trials that produce a statistic larger

than the critical value, given that an alternative hypothesis with time-variation in the

expected returns generates the data. Figure 1 takes the variances of expected returns

as the statistics. Figure 2 takes the empirical p-values of the expected return

variances as the test statistics. The approach is the same, except that, because the

empirical p-value is the result of a simulation, we now have to conduct simulations

within the simulations.

        Various estimators are displayed in figures 1 and 2. Auto is the sample

autocorrelation statistic, and the others are the implied expected return estimators

with various adjustments. We use the sample autocorrelation statistic as a "straw

man" for comparison, because most of the statistics used in the literature on weak-

form predictability are transformations of the sample autocorrelation (see, e.g.

Cochrane, 1991). Of course, we expect the sample autocorrelation to perform poorly




                                                                                           16

_________________________________________________________________________


under our model of the return dynamics, and the simulations bear this out. The

power of the autocorrelation is nearly level at about 5%, independent of the amount

of expected return variation. The estimator ABB refers to analytical and bootstrap

bias adjustments, ABMB refers to analytical bias, microstructure bias and bootstrap
adjustments. ABMNB refers to analytical bias, microstructure bias for negative

autocorrelations only and bootstrap adjustments. Boot has only bootstrap bias

adjustments and Unadj. refers to the estimators with no bias adjustments. The

differences between the power of these estimators parse out the separate effects on

power of the various steps in our estimation strategy. The figures show that the most

complicated procedure, ABMB suffers lower power in some parts of the curve, but

otherwise the various estimators give similar results.

        Figures 1 and 2 suggest that our weak form tests have the power to detect

modest amounts of predictability. For example, if the annual standard deviation of

the expected returns is 3%, the power of the various statistics is 14% to 19%. Using

15% as the standard deviation of the monthly index returns, an expected return

standard deviation of 3% means than a regression of the return on its expected return

would produce an R-squared of only (0.03/0.15)2=4%. That is, the expected returns

account for only 4% of the variance of the returns. With an annual standard

deviation of 5%, the R-squared would be about 11%, which is similar to the values

reported in some stock return regression studies. At this level the power of our tests

is near 60%. At a standard deviation of 6% or more for the expected returns, the

power of our tests is 80% or higher.

        In tables 3 and 4 we explore the robustness of our empirical results. One of

the questions to be further addressed relates to the treatment of the autocorrelations




                                                                                       17

of daily returns. Panel A of Table 3 presents results for the Standard and Poor's

index, replacing the stock index with index futures prices. Following Boudoukh et

al. (1993) and Blume, MacKinlay and Terker (1989), there should be no issues with

microstructure-related autocorrelation in the index futures returns. The daily index
futures are available from June of 1982 through September of 2002. The table shows

that our main results are robust to the use of futures over this period, and over the

more recent ten-year subsample. All of the point estimates of weak-form

predictability are zero.

        We use large firms' common stocks in the main experiments of tables 1 and 2,

because such stocks should be representative of the market. However, small firms'

stocks may have more serial correlation related to market microstructure effects, so

the contrast between the two should provide some indication as to the importance of

these effects. In addition, small-firm stocks may display more predictability related

to market inefficiencies, as it is more costly to trade the stocks of smaller companies

to exploit inefficiencies.

        Panel B of Table 3 repeats the tests of Table 1, using 26 small-firm stocks in

place of the large-firm stocks. The returns data are available from January of 1980

through September of 2002. The panel shows that the average weak-form

predictability estimates and the point estimates for some of the small firms are

somewhat higher than we found for the large firm stocks. The average bias-adjusted

estimates are 0.25% to 1.35% over the full sample, and 1.25% to 1.32% for the most

recent decade, depending on the estimator. The standard deviations of the monthly

returns are also markedly higher for smaller firms. Thus, the average predictability

estimate of 1.35% corresponds to only (.0135/.305)2 = 0.2% of the variance explained




                                                                                          18

by the expected return. Given this low signal-to-noise ratio, the average right-tail p-

values are all above 25%. The maximum values across the 26 firms seem more

impressive; for example, bias-adjusted predictability values of 16-17% are found for

one firm in the most recent decade. However, accounting for the multiple
comparisons, the chances of finding numbers this large are as high as 7.5% to

18.8%.10

           Table 4 presents the results of repeating the analysis of Table 2 using our

sample of small firm stocks. For comparability with Table 2, the first twenty stocks

are used. The available sample covers the 1981-2001 period. The results are very

similar to those of Table 2. Using firm-specific lagged predictor variables the bias-

adjusted estimates of semi-strong form predictability are between 1.78% and 3.62%,

depending on how the diagonal elements of the expected return covariance matrix

are treated. The diagonal elements imply more predictability than the off-diagonal

elements, as we saw before, but the covariability is somewhat lower among the small

stocks. With the lower sampling covariability, the diagonal-only estimates of

predictability become statistically significant. Again, there is no evidence that semi-

strong form predictability has diminished in the most recent decade.


5. Conclusions
           Small changes in expected returns can produce large and economically

significant changes in asset values. This paper presents new estimates of time-

variation in the expected returns of stocks, using indirect methods. Weak-form tests

find no reliable evidence of predictability in modern data. Semi-strong form tests

find small but economically significant predictability. In contrast to recent studies

that rely on aggregate predictor variables, we find no evidence that the predictability

has diminished in recent samples.

Appendix A: Semi-strong Variables
Our semi-strong form tests use data on lagged, firm-specific instruments and

economy-wide, macro instruments for the index. The firm-specific instruments are

obtained from CRSP and COMPUSTAT. They include for each stock month, (1) the

average return over the previous twelve months; (2), the book-to-market ratio,

defined as the most recently-available book value per share (quarterly Compustat

data item #60 divided by item #61) divided by the one-month-lagged price per share;

and (3) the earnings-to-price ratio, defined as the trailing four quarters' earnings

(Compustat data item #11) divided by the one-month lagged stock price. The stock

prices and returns are from CRSP.

          The macro instruments include: (1) the lagged three-month Treasury Bill




                                                                                        20

secondary market yield; (2) the lagged, one-month holding period return on a

three-month Treasury Bill; (3) the spread between the Treasury Bill yield and the

ten-year constant maturity Treasury Bond yield to maturity; and (4) the spread

between Moody's Seasoned AAA and BAA corporate bond yields, to proxy for
corporate default risk. All of the yield series are measured as the lagged monthly

average of daily values, from the Federal Reserve. In addition, we use the one-month

lagged holding period return on the Standard and Poor's Index, excluding dividends,

and the lagged 12-month holding period return on the S&P 500 Index, from CRSP.

We also use the dividend yield on the SPX index. The dividend yield is computed as

the trailing 12-month dividends divided by the SPX index level. Monthly dividends

are obtained from Bloomberg.


Appendix B: Estimation Issues
B.1 Weak-form Estimators
In our weak-form tests the objective is to estimate:


               Var( µ m ) = MV - D(ADV + 2θ ),                                     (B.1)

where          MV = E{(Rm - µ )2},
               ADV = E{E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)2|j ∈ m]}

and            θ = E{ E[( ∆ j - µ m /D)( ∆ j′ - µ m /D)|j,j' ∈ m, |j-j'|=1] }.



The finite sample variances, M̂V and ÂDV , and the monthly average of the daily

sample autocorrelations, have expectations that differ from the true values. Simple

calculations show that




                                                                                      21

_________________________________________________________________________




               E( M̂V ) = MV - (D/M)(ADV + 2θ),                                    (B.2)

               E( ÂDV ) = [(D-1)/D] ADV - 2θ /D,

               E( θ̂ ) = θ - (ADV + 2θ )/D,



where M is the number of months in the sample. The system (A.2) provides three

equations in three unknowns, and may be solved for unbiased estimators of MV,

ADV and θ. These are given as:


               θ ∗ = {D ÂDV + D(D-1) θ̂ }/{(D-1)(D-2) - 2},                       (B.3)

               ADV ∗ = {2D θ̂ + D(D-2) ÂDV }/{(D-1)(D-2) - 2},
               MV ∗ = M̂V + (D/M) ADV ∗ + (2D/M) θ ∗ .


Using these estimators, we form the unbiased estimator of the variance of the

monthly expected returns as:


               Var (µ m ) ∗ = MV ∗ - D( ADV ∗ + 2θ ∗ ).                            (B.4)



B.2 Imposing Positivity
Boudoukh, Richardson and Smith (1993) describe estimators for risk premiums,

imposing the restriction that the expected risk premium is positive. Their tests

involve the minimization of a quadratic form in the restricted and unrestricted
estimates, which we adapt to the current setting as follows. Let φ̂ be an N-vector of

unrestricted estimates of Var( µ m ) for N assets, whose sample values may be




                                                                                     22

negative. Consider the estimator


          φ ∗ = Arg Minφ ( φ − φˆ )'Cov( φ̂ )-1( φ − φˆ ) subject to φ ≥0,         (B.5)



where the inequality in the constraint applies element-by-element. The Kuhn-Tucker
conditions for this problem specify φ ∗ and an N-vector of multipliers U = {ui}i, which

satisfy


          ( φ ∗ − φˆ )' Cov( φ̂ )-1 - U = 0,                                        (B.6)
            ∗
          φ i u i = 0, i=1,...,N,
            ∗
          φ i ≥ 0, i=1,...,N, and

          ui ≥ 0, i=1,...,N.


We solve the system (B.6) numerically to obtain the restricted estimators, φ ∗ . Note
                                                  ∗
that when N=1 this amounts to setting φ i = 0 whenever the unrestricted value is

negative.



B.3 Semi-strong Form Estimates
In our semi-strong form analysis, we use simulations based on a parametric form of

the bootstrap to control statistical biases in the predictive regressions. The following

regression system is estimated for each asset:


                   Rt+1 = µ + ∈t +1                                                (B.7)

                   Zt+1 = µ z + A (Zt - µ z ) + vt+1,




                                                                                        23

where A is an L x L matrix and there are L instruments in Z. The sample means
estimate µ and µ z , and the OLS coefficient estimates A. These estimates are taken

as parameters of the simulation. Then, we resample from the vector of residuals
{ ∈t +1 , v t +1 }, randomly with replacement, and use these as the shocks in the

simulation. We build up the time series of Zt recursively in each simulated sample,

along with the contemporaneous returns, which satisfy the null hypothesis of
constant expected returns, µ . This approach preserves the first order autocorrelation

of the instruments and accommodates the finite sample bias discussed by Stambaugh
(1999), which arises when ∈t +1 and v t +1 are correlated. We regress Rt+1 on Zt, using the

simulated data samples, for each of the 1,000 simulation trials, and estimate the

predictability exactly as in the original data. Since the covariance of the expected

returns is zero, the true predictability is zero in the simulations. The average

measured predictability, taken across the simulation trials, is our estimate of the bias,

and the fraction of the simulations in which the actual data estimate exceeds the

simulated value, is the empirical p-value.

                                    Return Predictability Based on Weak-Form Information


The predictability measures are the standard deviation of the expected returns, in percent per month, on
an annualized basis.* The measures compare monthly unconditional return variances with average
conditional variances, estimated from daily data. Panel A presents results for the Standard and Poor's
stock index return over different subperiods. Panel B contains similar statistics for a sample of twenty
six large firms' individual common stocks. For individual stocks the average statistics (Avg) are shown,
along with the cases that produce the largest (Max) and smallest (Min) estimate of expected return
variation. Within each panel, the columns present different estimators, and the monthly return standard
deviations are included for comparison. The estimator σ (µm) is the annualized standard deviation of
the monthly expected returns, in percent. The estimator σ (µm)* is adjusted to remove the effects of all
first order serial dependence in daily returns. The estimator σ (µm)# is adjusted to remove only the
effects of negative first order serial dependence. The GMM estimates are found using the Generalized
Method of Moments. The Finite Sample Adjusted estimates subtract a bootstrapped estimate of finite
sample bias, under the null hypothesis of independent and identically distributed returns. Right-tail
empirical p-values are on the second line of each case with bootstrapped finite sample adjustments.

The implied predictability is the annualized standard deviation of the time-varying monthly
expected returns, in percent, for an equally-weighted portfolio of 20 large common stocks. The
figures are estimated from the covariance matrix of the individual stock regressions. The rows
report alternative calculations where either all of the elements of the covariance matrix are used, or
when the diagonal and off-diagonal elements are emphasized. The columns report experiments
where different predictor variables are in the regressions: Either firm-specific variables only, firm-
specific and Macro variables, or Macro variables only. The Bias-adjusted estimates subtract a
bootstrapped estimate of finite sample bias, under the null hypothesis of constant expected returns.
 Empirical right-tail p-values for this estimate are denoted as p-value.
