                                          ABSTRACT

Standard measures of private equity performance based on cash flows overlook discount rate risk.
An index constructed from prices paid in secondary market transactions indicates that private
equity discount rates vary considerably. While the standard alpha for our index is zero, measures
of performance based on cash flow data for funds in our index are large and positive. To illustrate
that results are not driven by idiosyncrasies of private equity secondary markets, we obtain
similar results using cash flows and returns of synthetic funds that invest in small cap stocks.
Ignoring variation in PE discount rates can lead to a misallocation of capital.

1. Introduction

        In recent decades, private equity (PE) has become an important asset class for investors.
A recent survey of institutional investors finds that 88% are invested in private equity, with nearly
a third having an allocation greater than 10% (Whyte (2017)). In the early 2000s, a secondary
market developed in which limited partners (LPs) can transact their stakes in private equity funds.1
Since data on secondary market prices are not publicly-available, investors and academics have
been limited to using data on cash-flows to evaluate the risk and return of private equity. As much
as half of the variation for public equity returns, however, is driven by news about discount rates
(Campbell (1991). Further, all variation in dividend price ratios for public equity corresponds to
variation in discount rates, not variation in expected cash flows (Campbell and Shiller (1989),
Campbell (2011)).
        These findings naturally lead to four important questions to consider. First, under what
conditions might performance measures based on cash flows overlook risk that arises from
variation in discount rates? After all, asset prices are not arbitrary and should ultimately be
determined by the properties of the underlying cash flows. Second, to what extent do discount
rates for private equity vary? The marginal PE investor may very well differ from the marginal
investor in other asset classes in terms of preferences, sophistication, sentiment, and risk aversion
that are all important determinants for discount rates. Moreover, the organizational structure of
private equity may generate unique risk dynamics. Third, how does variation in PE discount rates
impact standard performance measures such as CAPM alpha and beta, relative to other measures
of performance based on cash flows? And fourth, what kind of investor cares about variation in
PE discount rates?
        To answer the first question, we explore the relationship between the GPME of Korteweg
and Nagel (2016) and the standard one-period Euler condition that depends on market prices. The
GPME is unique among PE performance evaluation measures in that it is well grounded in asset
pricing theory. We highlight that it represents a first order condition for optimal asset allocation
and is equivalent to the net present value (NPV) of cash flows over the life of the investment. We
illustrate that the implicit beta in the discount factor for GPME, however, is a cash flow yield beta


1
 While secondary market liquidity was limited in the nascent years of the secondary market, liquidity has grown
substantially over the past decade.

                                                        1

with the growth in investor marginal utility. In contrast, the standard Euler equation represents the
one-period NPV using market prices, in which the implicit beta is a total return beta. We further
show that if discount rates vary over time, then GPME generally reflects the unconditional one-
period NPV plus a term representing PE discount rate risk: the covariance of PE discount rates
with the growth in investor marginal utility. Such risk impacts the one-period NPV, but not the
GPME.
          We then turn to the second and third questions mentioned above to investigate variation
in private equity discount rates and determine the impact of this form of discount rate risk on
performance evaluation measures. To do so we use data obtained from a large intermediary in this
market to evaluate the risk and return of private equity funds in a similar manner to the way in
which investors regularly use public equity markets to understand the risk and return of publicly
traded companies. Using these data, we construct market-based indices for buyout funds. By
comparing the performance of our indices with that of standard NAV-based indices and an index
based on listed private equity companies, we obtain new insights about the performance of private
equity. In contrast to much of the existing literature, our transaction-based indices suggest that
buyout funds do not outperform public markets on a risk-adjusted basis.2
        A difficulty in constructing an index using our secondary market data for private equity is
accounting for the facts that no fund trades in every period, and many funds do not trade at all. In
the subsample of funds that could be matched with cash flow data from the Preqin database, there
are 839 buyout transactions for 287 unique funds from 2006 through 2018, implying that the
average fund trades 2.9 times in our sample, conditional trading at all. Moreover, the funds that do
trade are not randomly chosen, and sample selection could potentially affect inferences from
empirical analysis if not controlled for econometrically.
        We explicitly account for the possibility that specific types of funds may trade more often
than others by using the approach of Heckman (1979). On a large sample of buyout funds, we
estimate the parameters of an econometric model using observed transaction prices. We use this
model each period to create an inferred price for every fund in our population every period,
including those that do not transact. We then construct our transactions-based index from these



2
 For example, current evidence suggests buyout funds outperform on a risk-adjusted basis (Higson and Stucke (2012),
Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan (2014), and Robinson and Sensoy (2016))..

                                                        2

inferred prices.3 When estimating index parameters, we account for non-synchronicity in prices
we observe using the approach of Dimson (1979).
         We estimate the beta of our main secondary market PE index to be 1.79 As emphasized by
Axelson, Sorensen and Strömberg (2014), the return on a buyout fund is essentially the return on
a portfolio of highly levered firms. If the portfolio firms prior to the buyout have unlevered betas
around 1, doubling their leverage, as was typically done in buyouts during our sample period
(2006-2018), should lead to a portfolio beta around 2.4 The benchmark beta of 1 in this calculation
is a total return beta, and produces a total return beta for PE consistent with the total return betas
we estimate using our indices. In contrast, others in the literature have measured beta for PE using
cash flows data only, an approach which is likely to overlook the influence of variation in discount
rates on betas. For our main index we document an alpha of -2% annually. This also contrasts with
the vast majority of the literature that in general finds that buyout funds outperform on a risk-
adjusted basis.
         We find that log book-to-market ratios vary considerably for our secondary market PE
index. Using regressions motivated by the Campbell Shiller (1988) identity, we find that all
variation in log book-to-market ratios for private equity can be explained by variation in market
discount rates. A similar phenomenon has been documented for other asset classes including public
equities, treasuries, credit, foreign exchange, and sovereign debt.5 From these regressions we find
the standard deviation of long-run private equity discount rates to be about 0.36. Cochrane (2011)
estimates the standard deviation of discount rates at similar horizons for public equity to be 0.29.
Our estimates suggest that discount rates for private equity vary about as much, if not somewhat
more, than those for public equity. In contrast, the implicit long-run discount rates in NAVs exhibit
a standard deviation of about 0.10. NAVs are too smooth, not only because they reflect stale
information, but also because they fail to reflect variation in market PE discount rates.
         In contrast to our index alpha, the GPME for funds in our main index is relatively large at
about 0.27, and is comparable to that of venture funds pre-1998, a period of strong performance
for venture funds (Korteweg and Nagel (2016)). An explanation for the discrepancy we find


3
  Other indices based on secondary markets have also incorporated some type of interpolation to infer the prices of
non-traded assets. Bond indices, for instance, often employ "matrix pricing" to infer the prices of non-traded bonds.
4
  This calculation assumes that the debt beta equals zero. In fact, estimates of buyout debt betas are positive, which
would lead the fund-level beta in this example to be less than 2 (see Kaplan and Stein (1990)).

  Cochrane (2011) provides a summary of the literature.

                                                          3

between the GPME for funds in our main index, and the alpha of the index itself is that
performance measures based on secondary market prices, such as alpha, depend on variation in
market discount rates for PE while performance measures based on cash flows do not. Other
reasons, however, might explain the difference in these results that are specific to PE secondary
markets, transaction costs, or the manner in which we construct our PE secondary market indices.
To rule out such explanations, we evaluate a group of investments in public equities where
valuations and portfolio construction are transparent, and where transaction costs are relatively
low. We construct the cash flows for a series of synthetic funds that invest in size-decile portfolios
of public equities. For these synthetic funds we find the estimated GPMEs to be large and
statistically significant, but standard CAPM alphas to be slightly negative. These results help
bridge the divide between the large estimated GPME for funds in our index and the estimated
index alpha that is slightly negative, and suggest that the gap is not driven by explanations specific
to our index or PE secondary markets. Rather, the divide appears to be differences in how these
performance measures account for PE discount rate risk.
         To address the fourth question presented above, we provide some discussion that considers
the kind of investor for whom PE secondary market prices are relevant. Many PE investors do not
often engage in PE secondary markets and simply collect the cash flows. It is similarly common
for investors who buy corporate bonds to avoid trading in secondary markets and collect the
coupons. Many bond investors, however, regularly optimize and rebalance their portfolios in
markets for credit and interest-rate swaps, which are facilitated by the existence of secondary
market prices for bonds. Just as the factor exposures of coupon or interest payments do not capture
the full risk exposure of bond investors, the factor exposures of PE cash flows do not capture the
full risk exposure of PE investors with a variety of objectives. We further add to this discussion
below.
         Finally, what role do liquidity discounts play in our results? The returns of all asset classes
in secondary markets are influenced to some degree by transaction costs. In secondary markets for
private equity, most transaction costs appear to be borne by sellers. Buyers earn a small premium
as market makers if positions are held to the end of a fund's life (Nadauld, Sensoy, Vorkink, and
Weisbach, (2019), NSVW hereafter). Our index returns reflect returns from buying and selling at
secondary market prices. To the extent that buyers earn a premium for market making, this
premium is largely canceled out when the position is sold three months later.

       Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss various approaches the literature
has taken to measure risk in private equity. Section 3 provides a conceptual framework motivating
our study of discount rate risk vs cash flow risk. Section 4 describes the methodology used to
create a private equity index using secondary market prices. Section 5 summarizes our data.
Section 6 presents estimates of the model used to create the index and subsequent PE alphas, betas,
and other performance metrics arising from the index. Section 7 describes empirical measures of
discount rate risk n private equity and its influence on standard performance measures. Section 8
concludes.

2. Prior Work Measuring Private Equity Risk and Return
       For most asset classes, investors rely on secondary market transaction-based indices to
measure performance, in which case risk can be appropriately characterized as the covariance of
total return with a relevant stochastic discount factor. Because such secondary markets did not
exist for many years in private equity, alternative approaches were developed to measure and
assess risk and return in this market. Korteweg (2018) provides a thorough survey of the PE
performance literature. Here we review a few highlights. We classify prior studies of PE
investment performance into six groups which vary depending on the recommended approach.
       First, a number of studies estimate the CAPM alpha and beta of private equity using book
returns based on the net asset value specified by the general partner (see Anson (2007), Woodward
(2009) and Ewens, Jones and Rhodes-Kropf (2013)). Because the portfolio companies often have
no observable market price, marked values often do not reflect the most recent information in
public markets. To accurately measure systematic risk, these authors project book returns on
current and lagged market returns and then sum up the estimated coefficients to obtain an estimator
for beta as in Dimson (1979). These studies find beta for buyout companies to be in the range of
0.70 to 1.0 with alphas ranging from 3.2% to 4.8% annualized.
       A second group of studies evaluate private equity performance by estimating the public
market equivalent, or PME, of Kaplan Schoar (2006) using cash flows paid to and received by
limited partners. Recent studies that use net-of-fee fund-level cash flow data find the PMEfor
buyout funds to be in the range of 1.19-1.23, suggesting that buyout funds outperform public equity
markets even after adjusting for fees (see Higson and Stucke (2012), Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan
(2014), and Robinson and Sensoy (2016)). Kortegweg and Nagel (2016) develop the GPME to


                                                5

relax restrictions on the stochastic discount factor implicit in the PME and study the performance
of venture companies.6
         A third group of studies evaluate PE performance by estimating factor alphas and betas
from regressions of log IRR's on the contemporaneous IRRsof the public equity market and other
factor portfolios. Most papers that take this approach estimate fund log IRRs from cash flows
between private equity funds and their portfolio firms (see Frazoni, Nowark, and Philippou (2012)
and Axelson, Sorensen, and Strömberg (2014).) These papers find buyout betas to be in the range
of 0.90 to 2.4 with alphas in the range of 8.6% to 9.3%.7
         A fourth group of studies evaluate the performance of private equity by creating mimicking
portfolios of publicly traded securities that are similar to PE in terms of portfolio company
characteristics (Groh and Gottschalg (2011) and Stafford (2017)). In a related approach, Gupta and
Van Nieuwerburgh (2020)) create synthetic strips to match the cash flows paid to and from limited
partners using a variety of exchange traded securities. The market prices of these strips cannot be
observed and are evaluated using a no-arbitrage pricing model. These studies find buyout betas
in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 and alphas in the range of 8.4% to 11.8% annualized.
         A fifth group of studies develop methods to estimate PE buyout risks by imposing a model
on systematic cash flow risks across funds and through time (Buchner and Stucke (2014), Driessen,
Lin, and Phalippou (2011), and Ang, Chen, Goetzmann, and Phalippou (2018)). These papers find
buyout betas in the range of 1.3 to 2.7 and alphas from -4.8% to 4.5% annualized.
         Finally, a sixth group of studies develop approaches to evaluate private equity based on the
returns to publicly traded private equity securities (Jegadeesh, Kraussl, and Pollet (2015) and
McCourt (2018)). These studies estimate betas for buyout funds to be in the range of 0.7 to 1.1
with alphas from 1.2% to 7.2% annualized.
         Overall, the vast majority of evidence in the literature suggests that buyout funds tend to
outperform on a risk-adjusted basis using data on PE cash flows. But valuation and performance

  Whereas the PME is the ratio of discounted distributions to discounted capital takedowns, the GPME is the difference,
or NPV based on a stochastic discount factor. When capital calls are stochastic, asset pricing theory makes no clear
predictions about the expected ratio because of a Jensen's inequality effect (see Kortegweg and Nagel (2016)). If we
define the PME as discounted distributions minus contributions, then the GPME nests the PME with the SDF defined
as the inverse public market return.
7
  In contrast to our work, studies based on cash flows between private equity funds and their portfolio firms estimate
risk and return gross of fees. Carried interest, which is similar to a short call position from the perspective of the
investor, causes the net-of-fee beta to be lower than the gross-of-fee beta if the fund itself covaries positively with the
market. Kaplan and Schoar (2005) run similar regressions using IRRs estimated from cash flows paid to and received
by limited partners.

                                                            6

measurement based on cash flow data can, in general, only account for cash-flow risk exposures.
Factor exposures measured in much of the existing work are "cash flow betas" that measure the
covariance between the stochastic discount factor (SDF) and cash flows of the underlying PE
investment.8 These estimates miss risk exposures coming from co-movement of the SDF with
valuations associated with changes in PE discount rates. Without data on actual secondary market
prices, it is impossible to understand the magnitude of this risk and the impact it may have on PE
performance and standard metrics such as alpha and beta.
        Some studies evaluate PE performance using either PE NAVs or exchange traded asset
returns. The well-known excessive "smoothness" of NAVs has been attributed to the use of stale
information by general partners. But the impact of stale information can be accounted for using
standard statistical techniques such as those proposed by Dimson (1979). Any excess smoothness
in NAVs after appropriately accounting for the use of stale information should emerge from
different causes. We provide evidence that variation in NAVs fails to account for dynamics in
market PE discount rates.
        To the extent that discount rates are correlated, market prices of other exchange traded
products could reflect some of the variation in PE discount rates, but other assets are clearly not
perfect substitutes for PE. The marginal investor in private equity is likely to differ from the
marginal investor for other asset classes, such as public stocks, in terms of preferences and
sophistication. Dynamics in sentiment and risk aversion and their impact on discount rates may
differ for private equity than for other assets classes. Moreover, the organizational structure of
private equity may also generate unique properties in private equity risk.
        Listed private equity securities, in particular, mostly represent publicly traded funds of
funds and the equity shares of general partners who have listed publicly. Their returns are likely
to be correlated with those received by limited partner returns in private equity funds but are also
likely to be different for at least four reasons. First, the cash flows of publicly traded securities of
private equity firms reflect cash flows of the general partners, whose claim is the present value of
future fees and carried interest earned by the fund, rather than the cash flows of the limited partner


8
 They are cash flow betas in a different sense than in Campbell and Vuolantenaho (2004). These authors define the
cash flow beta as the covariance between the total return of the asset being evaluated and the component of the SDF
attributable to news about aggregate cash flows. The factor exposures and SDF covariances behind performance
measures using PE cash flows in the existing PE literature represent covariances between the cash flows of the asset
being evaluated and the total SDF.

in a particular fund. Second, large, publicly traded buyout firms such as Blackrock and KKR hold
a variety of investments other than private equity, including hedge funds, real estate, advisory
services, etc. Third, some of the publicly traded private equity funds are funds of funds that charge
an extra layer of fees (that varies with performance) in addition to the fee collected by the managers
of the unlisted funds in which funds of funds invest. Finally, there is potential for sample selection
in the types of funds that choose to list public shares.

3. Performance Evaluation Based on Cash Flows versus Transaction Prices
         In this section we present a conceptual framework that connects cash-flow measures of
performance with traditional performance measures in asset pricing. In doing so, we characterize
the way in which an investor should use information in secondary market prices to make optimal
capital allocation decisions.

3.1. Two First-Order Conditions
         The standard Euler equation that defines optimal allocation to asset "is given by
                                #$ %$:$'( )*,$'( + -*,$'(    - -*,$ = 0                           (1)
where )*,$'( represents cash flows paid by the asset at time 1 + 1, -*,$'( is the value of the asset
at time 1 + 1, and %$:$'3 represents the investor's discounted growth in marginal utility from 1 to
1 + 4,
                                                    67 8$'3
                                                    3
                                        %$:$'3   =5                                               (2)
                                                     67 8$
where 5 is the subjective discount factor. After scaling by -$ the left side of (1) is alpha relative to
%$:$'3 . Numerous asset pricing studies test the null that unconditional alpha is zero relative to
various specifications for %$:$'3 . When the objective is asset allocation and evaluating the
expected welfare gains from tilting towards an investment the investor need not be the
representative investor, and although we follow Korteweg and Nagel (2016) in referring to %$:$'3
as the investor's stochastic discount factor (SDF), %$:$'3 is not necessarily an equilibrium pricing
kernel. The investor's SDF is typically expressed as a negative function of the return on the
investor's portfolio. This interpretation of the Euler condition given in (1) is analogous to the
standard interpretation of performance measures in the mutual fund and hedge fund literatures.
         Equation (1) characterizes optimal allocation to the asset for both a one-period investor,
and a long-term investor that maximizes expected utility over multiple periods and expects to
                                                   8

rebalance optimally in future periods. To highlight this point and connect equation (1) to cash-
flow measures of performance in private equity, consider a long-term individual investor who is
able to invest in private equity fund "that makes capital calls and provides distributions. At time 1
the investor chooses the number of additional units of private equity to acquire, where each unit
provides a series of stochastic cash flows, )*,$'3 , that arrive at times 1 + 4 for 4 = 1, . . :, where
)*,$'3 can be positive, negative or zero. Assume the investor makes this choice to maximize the

The price of an additional PE unit, -*,$ is zero if the first capital call is made after time 1. The left
side of equation (4) is the expected GPME developed by Korteweg and Nagel (2016), conditional
on time 1 information. For clarity, we refer to the left side of (4) simply as "GPME". If GPME is
positive, then the investor can increase expected utility by acquiring additional private equity units,
which lowers the covariance between %$:$'3 and )*,$'3 . To maximize expected utility, the
individual investor acquires additional units until (4) holds. Korteweg and Nagel (2016) test the
null hypothesis that (4) is zero for a sample of venture capital funds using an SDF that is a negative
function of the return on the public stock market portfolio.
        If the individual investor optimizes via secondary markets next period such that (4) holds
at time 1 + 1 then the first order condition given by (4) collapses to the standard Euler equation
given by (1). The Euler condition recognizes that the investment decision is dynamic, and that
future secondary market prices convey information about how the investor's portfolio and
marginal utility (and their relation to future cash flows) will likely evolve over time as the investor
optimally responds to changing market conditions.
        Rebalancing frequency in the real world is endogenously determined by investor objectives
and transaction costs. The most salient of such costs may be the liquidity discount. As a seller-
motivated market, buyers make a small premium for providing liquidity to sellers. NSVW (2019)

                                                       9

document that these costs amount to a 5% annualized performance loss for the seller and a 5%
performance gain for the buyer on average.              In a round-trip transaction these gains and losses
mostly cancel out. Other costs, however, can still prevent an LP from directly engaging in PE
secondary markets. For example, an LP can potentially harm relationships with GPs that may
preclude the LP from future deals if the LP sells PE stakes in the secondary market. LPs also face
costs to acquire sufficient expertise and/or key relationships to overcome asymmetric information
problems in these markets. When investors hold assets with high transaction costs, they generally
optimize their portfolios dynamically using correlated assets with greater liquidity. For example,
swap markets exist to enable corporate bond investors to hedge and rebalance their exposure to
interest-rate and credit risk. In this section we assume the existence of an individual investor who
chooses to rebalance each period, and highlight the relationship between the GPME and Euler
equations for such an investor.
         The left side of the Euler condition given in (1) is the one-period net present value (NPV),
expressed in terms of a stochastic discount factor. Notationally we refer to the one-period NPV as
A*,$ . We can rearrange the terms of (1) to express NPV in terms of a deterministic discount factor,
a known constant as of time 1, that is a linear function of the total return beta with the SDF. To
see how, note that:

where E$ = GHI$ (%$:$'( )/#$ %$:$'( , CD,$:$'3 denotes the risk-free rate from 1 to 1 + 4 and F*,$ is
the beta of the total return for the asset.9 In particular if C*,$'( = )*,$'( + -*,$'( /(-*,$ + A*,$ )
denotes the total return from purchasing at the zero-NPV price then,
                                                  MNO$ C*,$'( , %*,$:$'(

         In contrast, deterministic discount factors implied by GPME are linear functions of cash-
flow-yield betas with the SDF. To see this, divide up the cash flows paid by the asset into

         Equations (5) and (7) highlight that performance measures such as one-period NPV and
alpha account for covariation between prices and the SDF, while other measures based on cash
flows do not. Under what conditions do these differences matter? In the special case that the SDF
of the individual investor represents an equilibrium pricing kernel, both the one-period NPV and
the GPME are equal to zero. Otherwise, each performance measure may point to a different
optimal allocation strategy. For example, it is possible at time 1for NPV to be zero even though
the GPME is positive.
         To see this, if the final cash flow is paid out at time 1 = :, then -< = 0 and the one-period
NPV at time : - 1 is given by
                                     A*,<=( = #<=( %<=(:< )< - -<=( .                                          (9)
If we solve (9) for -<=( , substitute this definition of -<=( into A*,<=V , and continue in like manner
iterating backwards, we can express the GPME for fund " in terms of one-period NPVs instead of
cash flows,
                                                         <=$=(

                                   #$ WR%#* =                    #$ %$:$'3 A*,$'3  .                          (10)

Equation (10) is a simple accounting identity that shows WR%# is equivalent to the sum of
stochastically discounted one-period NPVs over the life of the fund based on the individual

10
   We again assume that the risk-free asset is zero NPV so that CD,$:$'3 = 1/#$ %$:$'3 . The rest of the derivation
closely follows footnote 10.

investor's SDF. Relative to the GPME defined in (4), we essentially add the stochastically
discounted price each period, #$ %$:$'3 -*,$'3 , and subtract it out in the subsequent period to arrive
at (10).
           The terms of equation (10) can be rearranged as
                                    <=$=(                                <=$=(

                  #$ WR%#* =                #$ [A*,$'3 ]#$ [%$:$'3 ] +           MNO$ (%$:$'3 , A*,$'3 ).     (11)
                                     3>?                                  3>(

If the risk-free security represents a zero-NPV investment based on the investor's SDF, then
#$ [%$:$'3 ] = 1/CD,$:$'3 . The first summation on the right of (11) may therefore be interpreted as
the risk-neutral discounted sum of expected one-period NPVs over the life of the fund, based on
marginal utilities given the investor's current portfolio. If expected NPV is constant over the life-
cycle of the fund, #$ [A*,$'3 ] = #$ [A*,$'Z ] for any 4 and [, then this first component may be
considered a rough approximation of :× NPV, to the extent that risk-free rates are close to one.
           To provide an intuitive interpretation for the second summation on the right of (11),
suppose an equilibrium pricing kernel exists given by the SDF of the representative investor,
%],$:$'3 , such that
                                     #$ %],$:$'( )*,$'( + -*,$'(          - -*,$ = 0.                         (12)
If the risk-free security represents a zero-NPV investment relative to both SDFs, then
                    A*,$ = MNO$ %$:$'( , )*,$'( + -*,$'( - MNO$ %],$:$'( , )*,$'( + -*,$'( .                  (13)
Equation (13) illustrates that one-period NPV from the perspective of the investor can naturally
arise, even when prices are in equilibrium, from differences in how future payoffs are discounted.
Such differences may naturally reflect, for example, a missing factor in %$:$'( relative to %],$:$'( .
For example, it is standard in asset management to evaluate the performance of investments based
on their ability to nudge the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio higher as indicated by the CAPM
alpha, even though the CAPM does not represent an equilibrium pricing model.
           From (13) we can see that when A*,$ is high, the representative investor "excessively
discounts" the future PE payoff relative to the preferences of the individual investor.11 We
therefore interpret the second summation term in equation (11) as a unique measure of PE discount
rate risk, which captures the covariance between the investor's SDF and movements in discount


11                                                                      ]
     In the marginal utility framework, a low negative covariance with %$:$'3 denotes a high discount rate.

                                                           12

rates. When this covariance is positive, prices tend to fall right when the investor's marginal utility
is high. Such positive covariance lowers the one-period NPV, but not the GPME. To relate the
GPME to the one-period NPV, therefore, this extra term must be added on the right of equation
(11).
        The covariance term on the right of (11) is non-zero only if one-period NPVs (or
conditional alphas) are stochastic. When this covariance is positive, GPME may be positive even
though the expected one-period NPV is zero. Even when an investment looks like a great deal
based on cash flows, for example, expected utility can sometimes be enhanced by choosing to wait
for an opportunity to get in on the investment when market discount rates are relatively high, prices
are low, and the one-period NPV is positive. By getting in immediately, the investor is simply
acquiring a position that loses market value right when capital resources are needed the most.

3.2. For Whom are Secondary Market Prices Relevant?
        Because cash-flow data are readily available, it is easier to estimate cash-flow based
measures of performance than others. Given that data on secondary market prices are available
however, investors can achieve greater ability to optimally allocate capital to PE and other asset
classes. Besides benefitting investors that engage in PE secondary markets to optimally rebalance,
information in PE secondary market prices can also help investors that typically buy and hold their
PE stakes to make better capital allocation decisions.
        As discussed above, transaction costs and objectives endogenously determine optimal
rebalancing frequency. (See, for example, Dimmock, Wang and Yang (2019)). Private equity
investors who face large transaction costs may optimally hold their private equity positions for
several periods without rebalancing, and simply collect the cash flows. It is similarly common for
investors who buy corporate bonds to avoid trading in secondary markets and collect the coupons,
and for banks to hold loans on their balance sheets and collect interest payments. Secondary
markets for bonds and bank loans exist, but they are rather illiquid. Banks and corporate bond
investors, however, still regularly optimize and rebalance their portfolios in relatively deep, liquid
markets for credit and interest-rate swaps. Observing movements in secondary market prices for
corporate bonds and securitized bank loans, regardless of whether such movements are driven by
variation in discount rates or news about future cash flows, enables such investors to know how to
optimally rebalance. Just as factor exposures and SDF covariances relative to coupon payments
do not capture the full risk exposure of corporate bond investors, factor exposures and SDF

                                                  13

covariances relative to PE cash flows do not capture the full risk exposure of PE investors.
Secondary market PE indices can enable PE investors to increase expected utility by trading in
correlated market products, even if secondary market transaction costs cause investors to generally
hold the PE position until liquidation.
        Moreover, investors that assign a zero probability to states of the world in which it is
optimal to rebalance in secondary markets after transaction costs risk misallocating their capital.
States of the world exist in which even investors that face high transaction costs will find it optimal
to rebalance their actual PE holdings. For example, during the 2008 Financial Crisis some
normally buy-and-hold private equity investors were hit with severe losses and found it optimal to
sell their R# stakes in secondary markets to avoid liquidity shortfalls from impending capital calls.
Such conditions represent particularly bad states of the world in which marginal utility is especially
high (states with high risk-neutral probability), making them among the most important
considerations when allocating capital to both private equity and other correlated asset classes.
Ignoring such states can lead to misallocations, unintended correlations, and unwanted risk
exposures. A better understanding of PE market valuations and their relation to risk factors can
help PE investors avoid liquidity shortfalls, smooth consumption, and hedge against states in which
assets with high transaction costs must be sold.

4. Creating an Index
        Relative to creating indices on exchange-traded securities such as stocks, creating a market-
based private equity index is challenging because every fund does not transact every period and
those that do transact are not selected randomly. Our approach to creating an index of private
equity returns relies on three key components: two first-order approximations and the estimation
of a Heckman (1979) sample selection model. We first lay out the basic intuition of our approach,
and then provide additional details.

4.1 Intuition of Index Construction
        To construct an index of returns, suppose we observe quarterly returns for ^ assets,
I( , ... , I` . The equal-weighted portfolio return for the quarter, Ia , is the cross-sectional average,
                                                         `
                                                  1
                                             Ia =            I* .                                  (15)
                                                  ^
                                                      *>(

If we project returns on a set of characteristics, bc , that includes an intercept,

                                                    14

                                           I*  = b7
                                                  c d + e* ,                                   (16)
then we can recover the true realized equal-weighted portfolio return as,
                                              Ia = b7 d                                        (17)
where b is the cross-sectional average value of bc across all ^ funds. In the linear projection given
by equation (16), both e* and bc e* average out exactly to zero across the ^ funds in our population.
These residual properties hold, and we can recover the true realized portfolio return, for any bc we
choose, provided that bc contains an intercept. The purpose of equations (16) and (17) is to
calculate the realized portfolio return, not to estimate the parameters of a model we hope is relevant
outside our population of ^ funds. The standard approach to calculate realized portfolio returns
given by equation (15), in fact, represents a special case of (16) with bc equal to one.
       We do not observe I* for the full population of ^funds, but only for a sample of funds in
a given quarter. If we were to estimate d using only the observations for which we have data on
both I* and bc then the OLS estimate of d will be inconsistent unless the subset of funds that
transact are chosen randomly. NVSW (2019) document, however, that larger and more established
funds are more likely to transact in this market, and hence, the funds that do transact do not appear
to be randomly selected.

        We therefore use a selection model to consistently estimate d, based on the approach of
Heckman (1979). While we do not observe I* for every fund, we do observe bc for every fund.
Using our estimate of d we calculate the index return as the average predicted return each quarter
as in (17) using all ^ funds in the population. We thus obtain consistent estimates of index returns
each quarter based on the private equity secondary-market transactions we observe.

4.2. Inferring Index Returns from Book-to-Market Ratios
       While the preceding discussion outlines the basic approach to index construction, we now
explain further details. Funds do not often transact in adjacent quarters, and as such, the number
of individual fund transactions and market value is much greater than the number of observed
individual quarterly fund returns. We therefore infer index returns from observed log book-to-
market ratios in adjacent quarters using the Campbell Shiller (1988) identity. Doing so enables us
to take advantage of all transactions in our sample, regardless of whether the same funds transact
in adjacent quarters or not. Besides enabling us to estimate returns for our private equity index,
our approach is convenient for understanding variation in PE discount rates, since all variation in

                                                  15

log book-to-market ratios must be associated with either variation in market discount rates,
variation in book-discount rates, or variation in future book-to-market ratios.
           Let the quarterly log portfolio market return for R# fund " from 1 to 1 + 1 be defined as
                                                       R*,$'( + )*,$'(
                                        I*,$'( = ln                    ,                       (18)
                                                             R*,$
where R*,$'( is the market value of the fund at time 1 + 1, and )*,$'( represents total distributions
minus capital calls for the portfolio from 1 to 1 + 1.12 Similarly, define the log-book return based
on net asset values as
                                                      ^iG*,$'( + )*,$'(
                                      h*,$'( = ln                       ,                      (19)
                                                           ^iG*,$
where ^iG*,$'( is the net asset value (book value) of the fund at time 1 + 1. Our approach relies
on two first-order approximations. The first is similar to an approximation of Vuolteenaho (2002)
based on the Campbell Shiller (1988) identity and is further developed in Appendix A. This
approximation provides a natural approach to adjust book returns to reflect market returns,
                                     I*,$'( = h*,$'( -j*,$'( k*,$'( + k*,$ ,                   (20)
where k*,$ is the-log book-to-market ratio of the fund,
                                         k*$ = ln ^iG*,$ - ln R*,$ ,                           (21)
and j*,$'( is an approximation parameter that can take on one of three values. If )*,$'( is positive
(negative) then j*,$'( is slightly below (above) one. When )*,$'( is zero, then j*,$'( is identical to
one and (20) holds exactly (See Appendix A for further details). Book values are likely to be
among the most informative variables that we can observe regarding the future cash flows of the
fund. Since we observe book-returns for every fund in our index each period, our market-based
returns, I*,$'( , contain all pricing information embedded in book values. The adjustment
-j*,$'( k*,$'( + k*,$ accounts for any omitted cash flow or discount rate news omitted in the book
return relevant for the market return.
           To aggregate individual fund returns to index returns, we rely on a second first-order
approximation in which the average log return is approximately the log average return (see
Appendix B). We cannot consistently estimate k*,$ for funds that are missing given a set of
characteristics, bcl , only #[k*,$ | bcl ]. We can, however, consistently estimate the cross-sectional


12
     When merging cash-flow data with market values we normalize to a $1 commitment.

                                                        16

average value of the log return each quarter, even if k*,$ is missing for some funds. Intuitively, the
true residual vanishes in the average.
           To illustrate, suppose that we do observe k*$ and a set of characteristics, bcl , across all
funds in each quarter. If we project k*$ on a panel of characteristics, bcl , that includes time fixed-
effects,
                                                  k*$ = b7
                                                         cl d + e*$ ,                                            (22)
then we can recover the true average value of k*$ in each quarter as
                                                     k*$ = bl 7 d,                                               (23)
for any choice of bcl , where bl denotes the average value of bcl across funds in quarter 1. Since
we do not observe k*,$ for all funds, we consistently estimate d under the model specification and
assumptions of Heckman (1979). Section 4.3 below provides additional details. Let d represent a
consistent estimate of d, and define I*,$'( as
                                    I*,$'( = h*,$'( - j*,$'( b7         7 
                                                              cl'o d + bcl d                                     (24)
While we do not observe k*$ for every fund in our index, we do observe h*,$'( , b7
                                                                                 cl'o , and j*,$'(

for the full population. Given our consistent estimate, d , it then follows that the cross-sectional
average value of I*,$'( across funds in each quarter is a consistent estimate of I$'( , the average
value of I*,$'( as defined in (20), representing the log return for the index.13

4.3 Two-Step Heckman Approach
           To estimate d in (22) we follow the two-step approach of Heckman (1979). In the first
step we estimate the parameters of a selection equation,
                                             p*$ = 1 q7
                                                      cl r + 6*$ > 0                                             (25)
where p*$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 when fund " transacts at time 1, and qcl represents a
vector of fund characteristics observable across all funds in the index. A consistent estimator of
the parameter vector r is available from a first-stage probit estimation of the selection equation
using all funds in the portfolio. We then estimate the inverse Mills ratio, E*$ , as
                                                            t q7
                                                               cl r
                                                    E*$ =                                                        (26)
                                                             q7cl r



13
  Note that j*,$ b7
                  cl d = j*,$ kc,l - e*,$ and that the approximation parameter, j*,$ , does vary slightly across funds in
our application. To ensure that the average value of j*,$ e*$ across funds in each quarter is zero we can appropriately
include j*,$ as one of the characteristics in bcl . In practice, however, this makes very little difference in results.

                                                            17

where t  is the normal distribution function and   is the cumulative normal distribution
function. The second step is to estimate the equation specified in (22) by OLS after including E*$
as an additional explanatory variable,
                                      k*$ = b7
                                             cl d + E*$ v + e*,$ .                             (27)
The estimate of d in (27) will be consistent under the following four assumptions: (1) qcl , bcl , and
p*$ are observed for every fund in the portfolio and k*$ is observed whenever p*$ = 1, (2) e*$ and
6*,$ are independent of both qcl and bcl with zero mean, 6*,$  is distributed Normal(0,1), and (4)
# e*,$ 6*$ = 56*$ where 5 is a constant. (For example, see Wooldridge (2010), p. 803.) Robust
identification that does not rely on assumption (3) requires an exclusion restriction: a variable in
the selection equation that is uncorrelated with the book-to-market ratio. To help ensure that
assumption (2) holds, all other characteristics in qcl are sometimes included in bcl in practice.

       Our approach differs somewhat from traditional hedonic techniques to estimate price
indices (e.g., Gatzlaff and Haurin (1998) and Hwang, Quigley, and Woodward (2005)). The
objective in estimating a traditional hedonic model is to understand price changes for a set of
differentiated goods conditional on observed attributes such as quality or specific features. To
mirror the typical portfolio definition of an index, we instead define a population of assets and
seek to understand changes in the value of the aggregate population for which attributes, such as
those related to expected cash flows and discount rates, change over time. An alternative approach
to building price indices involves using repeat sales (e.g, Peng (2001)). Repeat sales are too
infrequent in our transactions data to consider this approach.

4.4. Explanatory Variables
       The key variables in the pricing equation are time-fixed effects, or state variables that
represent time fixed effects, to ensure that the mean residual is zero within each quarter across all
funds in the population. If funds were selected at random, time-fixed effects would be the only
variables needed in our pricing equation to consistently estimate the average log book-to-market
ratio across our population of funds. Because we are estimating the parameters of a sample
selection model, any explanatory variables in the selection equation given in (25) that may be
correlated with log book-to-market ratios, for whatever reason, can be useful to include in the
pricing equation to help ensure that the pricing residual is independent of all explanatory variables
in the selection equation (see assumption (2) in Section 4.3 above). Our primary objective is

                                                  18

simply to estimate the average value of k*,$ , not to forecast the value of k*,$ for individual funds
or to understand how k*,$ relates to specific characteristics. We demonstrate that our results are
robust to the inclusion of either state variables or time fixed effects, with or without the additional
fund-specific characteristics in the pricing equation in Appendix Table 1.

4.5 Estimating Index Parameters
        We estimate index parameters (such as alphas and betas) for our private equity index. We
compare our estimated parameters against those estimated for other indices, including a Preqin
NAV-based index built using the same funds that are in our market price index, the Burgiss index
which is also a NAV-based index, and the S&P Listed Private Equity Index.
        So far, we have described a process to estimate the quarterly log return for our index. It is
well-known that the intercept in a regression of excess log returns on excess market returns cannot
be interpreted as alpha. A common solution is to estimate the intercept using annualized log
returns, and then adjust under the assumption that log returns are normally distributed (for
example, see Cochrane (2004) and Axelson, Sorenson, and Stromberg (2014)). To estimate
parameters for the Preqin, Burgiss, and S&P indices mentioned above we use simple quarterly
returns. To follow suit, we exponentiate our estimate of the quarterly index log return, the cross-
sectional average value of I*,$'( given in (20), to arrive at a consistent estimate of the simple return
for our index before calculating index parameters. We obtain similar results if we run regressions
using excess log returns and adjust the intercept based on the normal assumption as others have
done. These results are given in Panel A of Appendix Table 1.
        The transactions in the private equity secondary market upon which we build our index are
highly non-synchronous, occurring at various times throughout the quarter. Standard measures of
alpha, beta, and volatility using non-synchronous data are in general, inconsistent. We therefore
follow Dimson (1979) to estimate index betas by regressing returns on contemporaneous and
lagged values of the market return, for an appropriate number of lags, and summing the slope
coefficients. We estimate alpha as
                             w = Ia,$'( - ID,$'( - F(Ix,$'( - ID,$'( )                          (28)
where Ia,$'( represents our average estimated index return across quarters, ID,$'( is the average
return on short-term t-bills, Ix,$'( is the average public market return, and F represents our Dimson



                                                  19

adjusted beta. We obtain consistent estimates of volatility, Sharpe ratios, and correlation, under
the model of Dimson (1979) as outlined in Appendix C.

5. Data on Transactions in the Private Equity Secondary Market
       In this section we briefly describe the data and variables used to estimate the index. Our
transaction data come from a large intermediary in the private equity secondary market, extending
the data used by NSVW (2019). These data identify the fund that is sold, the total capital
committed by the seller, the amount unfunded by the seller, the purchase price, and the transaction
date for all transactions consummated through this intermediary from January of 2006 through
December of 2018. We clean the data as detailed in Appendix D and pull the most recent
transaction for each fund each calendar quarter for funds with a total commitment greater than
$500 million.
       We obtain data on other fund characteristics, such as calls, distributions, ^iG , fund yR
type, and size, from Preqin, from January 2006 through June of 2018, and clean these data as
detailed in Appendix D.     Preqin is built from a variety of sources including public filings and
reports, submissions by GPs, and FOIA requests. While there are other data sets that may be more
representative of the entire fund universe, Preqin is the only database that provides fund names,
thus making it possible to merge in our secondary market transaction data.
       Within each calendar quarter we sum all contributions and distributions for a given fund.
We then merge transactions data with the Preqin sample, some of which is done by hand (see
Appendix D for details). After this process, we end up with a sample of 596 funds for which we
have fund-level data. We observe 839 transactions on 287 of these funds between the first quarter
of 2006 and the second quarter of 2018.
       We propose using eight explanatory variables in our selection equation: the log size of each
fund, two age dummies, fund PME, the fraction of limited partners for each fund that are pension
funds, and three state variables that proxy for quarter fixed-effects. For our main results we use
state variables rather than quarter fixed effects to conserve power and because there is little
economic insight to be gleaned from the coefficients on the fixed effects themselves. We
demonstrate that our results are robust to this decision by replacing the three state variables with
time fixed effects. We also illustrate that our results are robust to whether or not we include
additional explanatory variables in the pricing equation along with state variables, or time fixed-
effects. We report these results in Appendix Table 1.
                                                20

        We measure size as total commitments by limited partners to the fund. The first age
dummy equals one if the fund age (calculated in years relative to the vintage year) is less than 4
years, and zero otherwise. The second age dummy equals one if the fund age is greater than 9
years, and zero otherwise. We also use the Kaplan-Schoar (2005) PME for each fund-quarter,
measured using cash flows from Preqin and using NAV at the end of the quarter as terminal value.
The fraction of limited partners for each fund that are pension funds comes from Preqin.
        Fund size and age are likely to be associated with asymmetric information about the fund
or GP, and therefore the likelihood that a deal agreeable to both parties can be reached. Fund age
is also directly related to the period over which fixed transaction costs can be amortized, suggesting
that younger funds may be less likely to transact. PME captures information about the performance
of funds that may be associated with supply and demand. Pension fund objectives are likely to
differ from those of other investors making PE funds with high pension ownership less likely to
be sold (further discussed below).
        The three state variables we use include the log-value-weighted book-to-market ratio for
small cap stocks, the TED spread, and a measure of total assets under management for the PE
industry. We measure the small-cap book-to-market ratio using stocks with share code 10 and 11
in CRSP with less than $500 million in market cap. We obtain the TED spread from the St. Louis
Federal Reserve calculated as the spread between three-month LIBOR based on U.S. dollars and
three-month treasury yields. We measure these two state variables at the end of the month prior to
the fund's transaction date for funds that transact, and at the end of the second month of each
quarter for funds that do not. Finally, we measure total assets under management, obtained from
Bloomberg, at the end of the prior quarter and scale by the total number of firms in the U.S. with
between 20 and 500 employees, obtained from the U.S. Census, measured at the end of the prior
year.
        We use the fraction of LPs invested in a fund that are pension funds, Rz*$ , as an instrument.
The investment objectives of pension funds differ from those of other investors: pension funds
manage investment cash flows to match the timing of their liabilities but face unique regulatory
incentives to refrain from dynamically hedging short-term liability risks (van Binsbergen and
Brandt (2015)). As such, pension funds may be less likely to engage in PE secondary markets
than other investors, such as a fund-of-funds. Consistent with this idea, NSVW (2019) document



                                                 21

that empirically, pension funds sell their private equity stakes much less frequently than other
investors.
        To be a valid instrument, Rz*,$ must be uncorrelated with log book-to-market ratios after
controlling for other observables. Book-to-market ratios are well known to predict stock returns,
suggesting that they largely proxy for risk or mispricing in the cross section. Evidence on the
relation between pension ownership and mispricing is somewhat mixed. Lerner, Schoar, and
Wongsunwai (2007) document that pension funds outperform other LPs (other than endowments)
in their PE reinvestment decisions, but their result does not replicate out of their 1990s sample,
which does not overlap with our sample period (see Sensoy, Wang, and Weisbach (2014)).14

         Table 1 reports summary statistics. Consistent with prior findings, funds on average
transact at a discount relative to NAV (see NSVW (2019)). The overall average log-book-to-
market-ratio is 0.23, roughly corresponding with a 20% discount (1/exp 0.23 = 0.80) and the
median is 0.11 corresponding with a 10% discount.
        The deviation between a fund's NAV and its market price will depend, in large part, on
how the market discounts future expected cash flows relative to the GP. Hence, a trade for less
than NAV is not necessarily reflective of a liquidity discount. The economic discount or premium
at which a transaction occurs should be measured relative to the (unobservable) underlying value
of the fund's assets, not the NAV.15
        Funds that transact in the secondary market tend to be larger and older than average. The
average log fund size for funds that transact is about 21.94 (corresponding with a size of $3.4
billion) compared to an average log fund size for funds that do not transact of about 21.28
(corresponding with a size of $1.7 billion). The average age of all transacting funds is 8.7 years,
and 6.4 years for non-transacting funds. In addition, funds that transact display slightly higher
average PMEs in the range of 1.16 compared to 1.13 for non-transacting funds. For the average
fund in our sample, about 53% of the limited partners are pension funds, as indicated by the
summary statistics on Rz*$ .

14
   Others find that pension funds make poor investment decisions relative to other institutions (see Hochberg and
Rauh (2012), and Andonov, Hochberg, and Rauh (2017)).
15
   NSVW (2019) develop this issue further. They argue that a second measure of a trade's discount relative to
fundamental value is the difference in returns between buyers and sellers. If transactions always occurred at
fundamental values and expected returns do not change over time, then buyer and seller expected returns should be
approximately the same. Instead, these authors find that buyers of LP stakes outperform sellers, suggesting that, on
average, transaction prices tend to be lower than fundamental values.

                                                        22

        Figure 1 reports the number of transactions per quarter for the full sample, of which there
are 839 transactions. The figure highlights the rapid growth in the secondary market. The years
2017 and 2018 report almost five times the number of transactions as occurred in 2006 and 2007.

6. Estimates of Secondary Market Based Private Equity Indices

6.1. Selection and Pricing Equations
        Table 2 reports estimates of the parameters for the selection and pricing equations specified
in (25) and (27). Columns (1) through (4) report results for the Heckman model, while columns
(5) and (6) report basic OLS estimates of the pricing equation without the inverse Mills ratio. For
both approaches we calculate bootstrapped standard errors clustered by time that account for the
inverse Mills ratio being a generated regressor.
        The estimates presented in columns (1) and (2) suggest that a number of variates are
associated with fund selection. First, our proposed pension fund instrument does predict selection
into the transaction sample even after controlling for other variables. Pension funds appear to be
substantially less likely to sell than their institutional investor counterparts. In addition, funds are
more likely to transact in quarters with a higher TED spread and in quarters with higher total
industry assets under management. Among the fund-specific variables, larger and older funds are
more likely to transact than smaller and younger funds, consistent with the idea that larger and
older funds may be associated with less asymmetric information or lower relative transaction costs.
Four to nine-year-old fund transactions are the most common age type in our data in terms of
absolute number but the percentage of four-to-nine-year-old funds that transact is smaller than the
percentage of older funds that transact. Table 2 also indicates that transacting funds tend to have
lower average PMEs at the time of the transaction after controlling for other variates. This finding
suggests that sellers tend to bring lower performing funds to market, all else equal.
        Columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 report Heckman (1979) estimates of the parameters for the
pricing equation given in (27), with the log-book-to-market ratio, k*$ , as the dependent variable.
A Campbell-Shiller (1989) decomposition indicates that higher values of k*$ is associated with
either higher market discount rates, lower book discount rates, or higher future book-to-market
ratios. We illustrate this decomposition and show empirically that all variation in k*$ is associated
with variation in long run market discount rates in Section 7.1.



                                                   23

       Column (3) of Table 2 indicates that k*$ tends to be higher when the log-book-to-market
ratio for public equities is high, with the coefficient on log É%$ equaling 0.79 (t-statistic = 3.8).
The estimates imply that a one standard deviation shock to log É%$ leads to an expected change
in k*$ of 0.18, approximately 1/3 of the standard deviation of k*$ . Our index tends to have higher
future expected returns when the public book-to-market ratio is high, i.e., when prices for public
equities are relatively low. Another important explanatory variable in the pricing equation is the
overall industry assets under management (Ñi;%$ ). The coefficient on Ñi;%$ is -0.20 with a 1-
statistic of -2.4. A one standard deviation shock to Ñi;%$ is associated in a change in k*$ of -0.19,
again, approximately 1/3 of the standard deviation of k*$ . Future expected returns for our index,
as indicated by a higher book-to-market ratio, tend to drop with PE assets under management. This
finding is similar to that of Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015), who find empirical evidence
for decreasing returns to scale in active mutual fund management at the industry level.
       The coefficient on the inverse Mills ratio in the pricing equation is not significantly
different from zero, with a point estimate of 0.06 and a t-statistic of 0.3. After controlling for our
chosen economy-wide and firm-specific characteristics, innovations in price and selection appear
to be uncorrelated. In this case, even OLS estimates of the pricing equation are consistent. In fact,
the OLS estimates of the pricing equation (columns (5) and (6)), are very close to those of the
Heckman estimates of the pricing equation.

6.2. Private Equity Indices over Time
       We create two equally-weighted market PE indices, one using funds of all ages, and a
second using only funds that are 4-9 years old. Figure 2 graphs our private equity indices over the
2006-2018 sample period on a log scale. For comparison we also present the performance of the
public equity market (from Ken French's website), two equally-weighted indices based on Preqin
reported NAVs, (one using funds of all ages and another using only funds that are four to nine
years old), the Burgiss index, and the S&P Listed Private Equity Index. We create the Preqin
indices using the same population of funds that we use to create the secondary market PE indices
and measure the return as the cross-sectional average of exp h*,$'( - 1 where h*,$'( is the log
return defined in (19). Our Preqin indices are quite similar to the Burgiss index. The correlation
between our Preqin index (all ages) and the Burgiss index is 0.97, while the correlation between
our Preqin index (4-9 years) and the Burgiss index is 0.95.


                                                 24

        Figure 2 illustrates that the two market PE indices are more volatile than the three NAV-
based indices (Preqin (all ages), Preqin (4-9 years), and Burgiss). The well-known excessive
"smoothness" of NAVs is generally attributed to the use of stale information by general partners.
It is also possible that NAVs may not fully reflect variation in market discount rates. We further
explore this issue in Section 7.1. The only sharp decline in equity markets during our sample period
occurred during the 2008 Financial Crisis. During this period, the NAV indices declined somewhat
because assets were written down, but did not decline nearly as much as public equity markets. In
contrast, the decline in the market PE indices over 2008 is similar to that in public equity markets.
Over 2008 the public equity market index declined 37%, the S&P Listed Private Equity Index
declined 64%, while the secondary market PE index (all ages) declined 60%. Our Preqin NAV-
based index (all ages), on the other hand, only fell by 25%, and the Burgiss NAV-based index
dropped by only 27% during 2008. Even though private equity NAVs were written down by nearly
one quarter of their value during the 2008 Crisis, their actual value most likely declined similar to
public equity markets at that time.

6.3. Risk and Return of Private Equity Indices
        In this section we report estimates of expected returns, beta, alpha, volatility, and Sharpe
ratios for the secondary market PE indices of buyout funds. To implement the Dimson (1979)
adjustment, we report regressions of index returns on lagged market returns in Table 3. The first
column reports estimates for the secondary market PE indices, while the remaining columns
contain estimates for the S&P Listed Private Equity Index, Preqin, and Burgiss indices. We
compute standard errors by GMM using the Newey West (1987) estimate of the spectral density
matrix.16
        Each of the NAV-based indices loads significantly on lagged market returns through three
lags. The S&P Listed Private Equity Index appears to be uncorrelated with lagged market returns.
We find that the secondary market PE indices load significantly on lagged market returns through
only one lag. The estimates in Table 3 suggest that when applying adjustments based on Dimson
(1979), we should account for cross-autocorrelation with market returns at one lag for the



16
   The secondary market PE indices contain measurement error that is reasonably independent of the actual index
return. Since this measurement is reflected in the dependent variables of our regressions, it is absorbed in the
regression residuals.

secondary market PE indices, at three lags for the NAV-based indices, and zero lags for the S&P
Listed Private Equity Index.
           Table 4 reports index parameter estimates for the various indices including the secondary
market PE indices. For this table we compute GMM standard errors using the Newey West (1987)
spectral density matrix along with the delta method, as needed. Consistent with Figure 2, the
estimates in Table 4 indicate that buyout funds have performed well over our sample period. The
average return for the secondary market PE index using funds of all ages is 14% and using funds
that are 4-9 years old is 22%. In contrast, NAV-based index returns have averaged from 11-14%,
while the S&P Listed PE Index averaged a return of only 9% over our sample period.
           The betas for our secondary market PE index using funds of all ages ais 1.79, and using 4-
9 year-old funds is 1.76. These estimates are larger than most betas reported in prior literature.
As discussed above in previous sections, betas estimated using cash flow data are unlikely to pick
up variation in PE discount rates that are manifest in actual market prices for PE. To understand
the magnitude of our estimate, recall that private equity funds are portfolios of equity positions in
leveraged buyouts. Since buyouts tend to be much more highly levered than public firms,
Modigliani-Miller Proposition 2 implies that buyouts should have substantially higher betas than
public firms. For example, Axelson, Jenkinson, Strömberg, and Weisbach (2013) report a mean
debt-to-total-capital ratio of 70% in their sample of 1,157 LBOs, with mean leverage closer to 50%
during our 2006-2018 sample period. In contrast, typical large publicly traded firms have
approximately a 20-25% debt-to-total-capital ratio. If the firms experiencing buyouts have asset
betas equal to 1, that reflect both discount-rate and cash-flow effects, and debt betas are positive
but relatively small, the equity portion of the LBO should nonetheless have a beta close to 1.60-
1.80, which is consistent with our estimates.17
           For the secondary market PE index using funds of all ages, we document an alpha of -2%
annually. The vast majority of the literature finds that buyout funds outperform after accounting
for risk manifest in PE cash flows. Our alpha accounts for both the covariance of cash flows with
the SDF, as well as the covariance of discount rates with the SDF. The alpha of the secondary
market PE index using 4-9 year-old funds is estimated to be relatively high at 6% annualized
(though insignificant). It's possible that funds may tend to perform better as they acquire assets,
though we cannot reject the null that the alpha for 4-9 year-old funds is zero.

     See Axelson, Sorensen, and Strömberg (2014) for more discussion.

        Using log returns we find betas of 1.94 using funds of all ages and 1.85 using 4-9 year-old
funds. The adjusted alphas under the normal assumption for both indices are both very close to
zero. We report these results together with those of other robustness tests in Appendix Table 1.
        The S&P Listed Private Equity Index produces a beta of 1.74, which is similar to that of
our secondary market PE indices. Average returns and alphas, however, are quite different. The
S&P Listed PE index earned an average a return of 9% (t-statistic of 1.0) and an alpha of -7% over
our sample period (t-statistic of -2.7).
        Relative to other indices in Table 4, the estimated volatilities and betas for the NAV indices
are quite low. These results suggest that NAV-based indices, even after Dimson adjusting, fail to
capture important dynamics in private equity that are related to public equity markets, such as
variation in discount rates. We further explore this issue in Section 7.1. Adding more lags to the
Dimson adjustment does cause the betas of NAV-based indices to become more similar those of
the transaction-based indices or the S&P Listed Private Equity Index.18 In addition, there is a large
difference in volatility between the secondary market PE indices (about 34%) and the NAV-based
indices (ranging from 14% to 20%). The volatility of the S&P Listed Private Equity Index (30%)
is also larger than the NAV-based indices. We provide evidence in Section 7.1 that NAV-based
indices do not fully account for variation in market PE discount rates, which represents another
cause for NAV smoothness above and beyond stale information.

7. Discount Rate Risk in Private Equity
        In this section we address two questions. First, how much do private equity discount rates
vary over time? Second, to what degree does variation in discount rates create a wedge between
standard and cash-flow-based measures of performance? To answer the first question, we run
regressions of long-run private equity secondary market returns on log book-to-market ratios
motivated by the Campbell-Shiller (1988) present value identity. To answer the second question,
we empirically investigate the relative importance of the two components of GPME in the
decomposition of equation (11), discounted one-period NPVs and PE discount rate risk.




18
 Even if we include seven lags in the Dimson adjustment as suggested by Metrick and Yasuda (2010), we find that
NAV-based betas over our sample period are only 0.73 to 0.85.

7.1. Variation in Book-to-Market Ratios and Discount Rates
       In this section we explore how much private equity discount rates vary over time. Equation
(20) shows that the difference in log market returns and log-book returns can be written as a linear
function of book-to-market ratios to a first-order approximation (Vuolanteenaho (2002)). Taking
a cross-sectional average of the relation specified in (20) across funds, we obtain
                              `                                `

which can be written as
                              h$'( - I$'( = j$'( k$'( -  k$ + 8ÖÜ,$'( ,                        (30)
where 8ÖÜ,$'( denotes the empirical covariance between j*,$'( and k*,$'( in the cross section across
funds, Other parameters are self-explanatory. As explained in Section 4.2 and Appendix A, the
approximation parameter, j*,$'( , can only take on one of three values, all close to 1.0. Not
surprisingly, we empirically find time series variation in j$'( to be trivially small, with a quarterly
standard deviation of about 0.01 over our sample. Further, the mean value of j$'( across time is
statistically indistinguishable from 1.0. We therefore motivate the empirical exercise of this
section by setting j$'( = 1 in each quarter.
       Iterating on (30) through time 1 + [ after setting j$'( = 1 and taking expectations
conditional on information at time 1we obtain,
                                     Z                   Z

                                    3>(                  3>(

where á$'Z represents a variable given by
                                                  Z

                                         á$'Z =         8ÖÜ,$'3  + k$'Z .                      (32)
                                                  3>(

Equation (31) says that variation in the average log book-to-market ratio, k$ , must be associated
with variation in market PE discount rates, #$ [I$'3 ], variation in book discount rates used to
compute NAV, #$ [h$'3 ], or variation in #$ á$'Z . We can better understand this variation by
regressing long-run market returns, long run book returns, and long run values of á$'Z on k$ in
three separate regressions.

                                  á$'Z = Hã + Fã k$ + âã,$'Z
Given the relation provided in (31) it follows that
                                            1 = Fà + Fä + Fã .                                 (34)
We can interpret the slope coefficients, Fà , Fä , and Fã as the fraction of variation in k$ associated
with variation in market PE discount rates, book PE discount rates, and #$ á$'Z (Cochrane
(2011)).
       In Table 5 we report results for the slope coefficient for the three regressions given in (33).
Panel A reports results for [ = 1 quarter. These results are for non-overlapping regressions of
quarterly realizations of I$'3 , h$'3 , and á$'Z on lagged values of k$ . Panels B and C report results
for overlapping regressions where [ = 4 (1 year) and [ = 20 (5 years). We compute Hansen-
Hodrick (1980) standard errors that account for the overlapping returns in our regressions, taking
the estimated book-to-market ratios from our index as given.
       In Panel A we see that at the quarterly horizon, about 89% of the variation in book-to-
market ratios is associated with variation in #[á$'Z ]. The value of Fã in Panel A is estimated to
be 0.89, is highly significant, and the R-squared for this regression is 75%. This result is driven by
covariation between current and lagged book-to-market ratios. Regressing 8ÖÜ,$'( alone on k$
produces an insignificant slope coefficient of 0.0002.
       In Panel B of Table 5 we see that at longer horizons, more variation in book-to-market
ratios is explained by variation in market discount rates. In the regression of annual returns on
book-to-market ratios one year prior given in Panel B, the estimated value of Fà is 0.45, is highly
significant, and the R-squared is 7%. Still in Panel B, most of the variation in book to-market
ratios is associated with variation in á$'Z . The estimated value of Fã in Panel B is 0.83 and the R-
squared for this regression is 41%.
       In Panel C of Table 5, the estimated value of Fà for the regressions of 5-year returns on
book-to-market ratios five years prior is 1.65, is highly significant, and the R-squared is 54%. In
contrast, estimates of Fä and Fã are insignificant in Panel C. In fact, estimates of Fä are

                                                    29

insignificant in all panels, and in Panel C, the point estimate of Fä is negative. The negative
coefficient on Fä is consistent with the hypothesis that book discount rates respond weakly to and
are positively correlated with market discount rates.19
         Expected long-run returns in (31) are given by Fà k$ , and an estimate of the variation in
                                          V
long-run expected PE returns is given by Fà GHI k$ .We estimate GHI(k$ ) to be 0.048, implying
that the standard deviation of long-run expected returns is 0.36. Cochrane (2011) estimates the
standard deviation of long run expected public equity returns over a five-year horizon to be 0.29,
implying that PE discount rates vary about as much as those for public equity, if not slightly more.
In contrast, the standard deviation of book discount rates is only 0.10. NAVs are too smooth, not
only because they reflect stale information, but also because they fail to reflect variation in market
discount rates for PE.
         The primary implication of Table 5 is that variation in PE book-to-market ratios for private
equity is attributable to variation in long run market-discount rates. None of the variation
significantly corresponds to variation in long run book-discount rates or variation in expected
future book-to-market ratios. This is a pervasive phenomenon that has been documented for other
asset classes including public equities, treasuries, credit, foreign exchange, and sovereign debt.20
The results of this paper highlight the fact that performance measures based on cash flow data are
unlikely to adequately account for variation in prices driven by variation in discount rates.

7.2 Decomposing GPME
         We estimate the unconditional expected GPME using funds in our market private equity
index using funds of all ages,

coefficient in a regression of ç$'Z on k$ . In this case, Fä may be less than zero if S( is sufficiently negative
(implying a positive relationship between book and market returns) and Fé is sufficiently small. For five-year
returns we estimate S( to be -0.39 and Fé to be 0.20. A similar explanation illustrates why Fà is above 1.0.

the corresponding time period. We build our market private equity index using funds with recorded
cash flows in Preqin from 2006 through 2018. The vintages of these funds span from 1988 through
2018. We scale all cash flows to a $1 commitment and use NAV as a terminal value for funds not
yet liquidated by the end of our sample.
           Our approach to estimate GPME and to conduct inferences is identical to that in Korteweg
and Nagel (2016),21 and here we highlight only a few details. We define the SDF as,
                                       %$:$'3 = exp H? 4 + H( Ix,$:$'3                                   (36)
where Ix,$:$'3 is the log market return from 1 to 1 + 4, and H? and H( are parameters chosen to
price two benchmark funds created for each PE fund such that average benchmark GPMEs across
funds are both equal to zero. The two benchmark funds for PE fund " invest all capital in either
the public market index or short-term t-bills, and the timing of their capital calls and distributions
mimic the timing of flows to PE fund " in the sample. To conduct inferences, we compute a GMM
ê-statistic for the test that GPME pricing errors across all funds are zero.
           We find the GPME for our funds in our index to be 0.270 with a ê-statistic p-value of 0.31.
Korteweg and Nagel (2016) report the GPME for venture capital funds of pre-1998 vintage to be
0.423 and of post 1998 vintage to be 0.048. Our point estimate of the GPME for buyout funds in
our index is about two-thirds that of venture funds pre-1998, a period of strong performance for
venture funds.         Although economically meaningful, the point estimate is not statistically
significantly different from zero, highlighting the general difficulty of precisely measuring GPME
with short samples and overlapping cash flows. We also find the average annualized IRR for the
funds in our index to be 14.42%.
           In contrast, the annualized unconditional CAPM alpha for our secondary market PE index
is -2%(reported in Column 1 of Table (4)), or about -50 basis points per quarter, and is not
statistically significantly different from zero. As equation (11) shows, performance measures
based on secondary market prices, such as one-period NPV and alpha, depend on variation in
market discount rates for PE, while GPME does not, and can justify the disparity we find between
the positive GPME using funds in our index and the negative alpha of the index itself.

           Other reasons, however, might explain the difference in these results that are specific to PE
secondary markets, transaction costs, or the manner in which we construct our PE secondary


21
     We thank Arthur Korteweg for supplying us with Matlab code to estimate the GPME and to conduct inferences.

market indices. To rule out such explanations, we evaluate a group of investments in public
equities where valuations and portfolio construction are transparent, and where transaction costs
are relatively low. We create the cash flows for a series of synthetic PE funds that make capital
calls and invest in size decile portfolios from 1980 to 2018. To create these synthetic funds, we
adopt the same methodology of Korteweg and Nagel (2016) to create benchmark funds. The
timing of cash flows for our synthetic funds mimic those of a "representative fund" created by
averaging cash flows across all funds in our index after aligning them in fund-inception time. A
new fund begins with a capital call every six months, invests capital in its assigned decile portfolio,
makes calls and distributions in subsequent years, and liquidates after 10 years.                       We relegate
further details of creating our synthetic funds to Appendix E. The end result is a series of
overlapping cash flows for 590 synthetic funds that each make capital calls and invest all capital
in one of the size decile portfolios, 59 funds for each decile. Our results are conservative in that
our synthetic funds are unlevered.

         Table 6 reports results for our set of synthetic funds. Column (1) reports the decile in which
the funds invest called capital. In column (2) we report the average IRR for each set of synthetic
funds, which range from 12% to 25%. In column (3) we report the estimated unconditional
expected GPME as in (35) for each of the size decile portfolios, and in column (4) we report the
p-value of the ê-statistic. All synthetic funds we create exhibit significantly positive GPME except
funds that invest in the largest decile of stocks, for which the GPME is significantly negative. Our
test statistics have greater power than those for the GPME of funds in our index because the cash
flows for our synthetic funds span a longer time sample and exhibit less-overlap. The GPME for
funds in our index (reported above) is 0.27 and is somewhat comparable to that of our synthetic
funds that invest in small cap stocks, even though our synthetic funds lack any leverage. In Table
6 the GPME for the smallest decile is 0.512 with a ê-statistic p-value near zero, and for the second
smallest decile is 0.205 with a p-value of 0.03.
         Similar to equation (11) which provides a decomposition for the conditionally expected
GPME, we can decompose the unconditionally expected GPME given above in equation (35) into
two components22

For each set of synthetic funds, we estimate the first component on the right side of (37), the sum
of discounted one-period NPVs (DNPV). Discount factors to measure DNPV, # %$:$'3 , are the
unconditional expectations of the SDF given in (36), for 4 = 1, ... , :. We have low degrees of
freedom in the time series to estimate these expectations as simple averages at long horizons.
Hence, we use a second order Taylor series approximation around # Ix,$:$'3 = 4# Ix,$:$'( , to
estimate the expected discount factor. We have greater degrees of freedom to estimate the expected
value of the log quarterly market return, # Ix,$:$'( , as a simple average. In particular, our estimate

where Ix,$ and ìx,$ represent the average and variance of the quarterly market return. For each
group of funds that invests in a given decile, we use the same SDF parameters, H? and H( that we
use to estimate the GPME for funds in that decile. Over our sample, we estimate Ix,$ to be

2.7%and ìx,$ to be 0.69%.

definition, A$'3 = #$'3 A$'3'( , and it follows by iterated expectations that # A$'3'( = #[A$'3 ].
For each fund we therefore estimate the unconditional expected sum of discounted one-period
NPVs, DNPV, as an average of ó^RG* across funds,
                                              <=$=(
                                                                ]
                                 ó^RG* =              # %$:$'3 A$'3'(                             (40)
                                                3>?

We estimate the GMM ê-statistic recommended by Korteweg and Nagel (2016) to test the null that
the average discounted one-period NPVs across all funds ais zero, taking estimated discount
factors as given.
       As reported in Table 6, DNPVs are insignificant for all deciles except decile 1. The point
estimate for DNPV is also largest for funds that invest in decile 1, at 0.317 with a ê-statistic p-
value near zero. This result is consistent with a small-cap premium over our sample, which extends
from 1980 to the present. Since the GPME for decile 1 is 0.512, the discount-rate risk component
of (37) comprises about half of the GPME for funds that invest in this decile. For other small-cap

                                                      33

deciles DNPVs are relatively close to zero and insignificant. For these deciles, virtually all of the
GPME is due to the PE discount rate risk component of (37), not large one-period NPVs. The
potential welfare gains of tilting towards PE implied by the GPME measure disappear after
accounting for small-cap discount rate risk. For larger deciles, point estimates for DNPV get
progressively larger, but are insignificant from zero, and are not as relevant for comparing with
our results for buyout funds that, for the most part, invest in small cap firms.
       Finally, for each decile portfolio we also estimate the standard one-period alpha as the
intercept of the regression
                                  Iò,$ - ID = wò + Fò Ix,$ - ID .                             (41)
This is the primary parameter of interest for investors holding the market portfolio that seek to
maximize the Sharpe ratio. We estimate GMM standard errors using the Newey West (1987)
estimator of the covariance matrix and convert t-statistics to p-values for consistency with other
results in the table. Standard alphas reported in column (7) for each decile portfolio are all
insignificant and very close to zero for all deciles, except decile 1. The alpha for the decile 1
portfolio is 0.023 with a p-value of 0.01 again, consistent with a small-cap premium over our
sample. The alphas for most other deciles are slightly negative.

       In summary, our results indicate that GPME can reflect CAPM alpha when it exits, but that
GPME can also be rather large and positive even when CAPM alpha is zero or even negative.
These findings are based on unlevered synthetic funds. Applying leverage would further amplify
our results and widen the gap between GPME and CAPM alpha. These results help bridge the
divide between our estimated GPME for funds in our index of 0.27 and an estimated annualized
alpha of -0.02. Comparing these results from those of Table 6, it appears unlikely that other
reasons specific to PE secondary markets, transaction costs, or the manner in which we construct
our PE secondary market indices can explain the disparity between the large positive GPME we
find for funds in our index, and the negative alpha we document for the index itself. The low alpha
appears to reflect discount rate effects on prices that are not accounted for by GPME which only
accounts for the covariation of realized cash flows with the SDF.

8. Conclusion
       Measuring the performance of private equity investments has historically only been
possible using cash-flow data. However, in recent years, a secondary market has developed in

                                                 34

which investors in private equity funds can trade their stakes. Prices from this market provide a
source of data useful for measuring the risk and return of private equity funds in a similar manner
to that commonly used to measure returns for other securities.
       We construct indices of buyout performance using a proprietary database of secondary
market prices of private equity stakes between 2006 and 2018. Analysis of the index indicates that
discount rates in private equity vary considerably, an insight that is not readily available from cash-
flow based measures of private equity performance. This result is confirmed in multiple empirical
analyses. First, we decompose the Korteweg and Nagel (2016) GMPE framework into two
components. The first reflects the risk-neutral discounted sum of one-period NPVs in each period
over a funds life, and the second captures the covariance of the investor's marginal utility with PE
discount rates. We find evidence that PE outperformance based on cash-flow based measures such
as GPME are driven almost entirely by the covariance of the investor's marginal utility with
discount rates, not large one-period NPVs. We also show in simple Campbell-Shiller
decomposition regressions that all of the variation in log book-to-market ratios can be explained
by variation in market discount rates, as opposed to book discount rates. The implication of these
results is that buy-and-hold private equity investors might be exposed to unidentified risk when
making capital allocation decisions.
       Our estimates indicate that the secondary market PE indices of buyout funds track public
equity much more closely than NAV-based indices we consider. The hedonic buyout indices we
construct have market betas in the 1.79 range, consistent with the notion that buyouts with
increased leverage have higher betas, in marked contrast to the NAV-based indices, whose
Dimson-adjusted betas are estimated to be around 0.8. Even after adjusting for known staleness in
NAV's, estimated betas from NAV-based indices likely understate the extent to which private
equity returns depend on market-wide factors.
       The buyout indices we construct have a number of potential uses for investors. Better
estimates of private equity risk and return should affect the optimal portfolio decisions of investors
when deciding on the allocation to private equity in their portfolios. In addition, the indices can be
used to provide more accurate valuations of stakes in private equity funds that investors hold in a
manner similar to the "matrix pricing" approach commonly used to price illiquid bonds. Appendix
F describes such an approach and provides annual estimates of market values for 2002-2014
vintage funds. Our estimates suggest that the use of NAV for valuation as is done by most LPs can

                                                  35

be misleading, and that NAVs often substantially misstate the value of an investor's private equity
holdings. For example, the market-to-book ratios of funds during the financial crisis reached as
low as 0.60 and were as large as 1.4-1.5 in the years coming out of the crisis. Improving these
valuations is likely to affect investors' decisions about both the portfolio allocations and the
amount they spend from their invested assets.
       Undoubtedly, there are uses for the indices we have not discussed in this paper. For
example, one could design derivative contracts based on an index of private equity returns. These
derivatives could potentially be useful to investors or GPs who wish to hedge risks in their
portfolios, or to speculate on the performance of the buyout sector. Better indices of private equity
performance such as the ones presented here clearly have much to offer the private equity
community.

   Appendix A. Returns from Book-to-Market Ratios
        In this appendix we demonstrate the derivation of Equation (20) of the paper. Let the log
return on a given PE fund be defined as
                                                 R$'( + )$'(
                                     I$'( = ln                                               (A.1)
                                                      R$
where R$ is the market value of the portfolio at time 1, and )$ represents cash flows (total
distributions minus capital calls) for the portfolio from 1 - 1 to 1. Equation (A.1) is for a single
fund but here we omit fund-level subscripts for notational ease. Note that )$ may be positive,
negative, or zero. Similarly, define the log ^iG -based return as
                                               ^iG$'( + )$'(
                                  h$'( = ln                  .                               (A.2)
                                                  ^iG$
If )$'(  0 then it follows that the difference in these two return measures can be written as
                                ^iG$'( + )$'(      R$'( + )$'(
             h$'( - I$'( = ln                 - ln             - k$

                          = ln exp öä,$'( + S$'( - ln exp öà,$'( + S$'( - k$
where
                                                    ^iG$'(

                                      öà,$'( = ln            ,                               (A.4)
                                                      )$'(
                                                    ^iG$

                                                     R$
and
                                            S$'( = ±1,
where the sign of S$'( depends on the sign of )$'( . Vuolteenaho (2002) derives a similar
approximation scaling by dividends. Since cash flows for private equity can be negative, unlike
common stock dividends, we scale by the absolute value of net cash flows, otherwise öä$ and öà$
are not well defined. A first-order Taylor series approximation of (A.3) centered around ö? implies
                            h$'( - I$'(  j$'( öä$'( - öà$'( - k$ 
                                                                                             (A.5)
                                          = j$'( k$'( - k$ ,
where the constant of approximation j$'( is given by


                                                 41

                                                     exp ö?
                                       j$'( =                   .                              (A.6)
                                                  exp ö? + S$'(
Alternatively, if )$'( = 0 then the second row of (A.5) holds exactly at j$'( = 1. Hence, we
allow the constant of approximation to change depending on whether cash flows are positive,
negative, or zero. Equation (A.5) implies
                               I$'(  h$'( - j$'( öä$'( - öà$'( + k$                            (A.7)
which is equation (20) of the paper.
        The median value of        öä$ across all funds/quarters in our sample is about 2.68,
corresponding with

Our results are quite robust to this specification and are markedly similar if we specify j$'( to be
any value in the range from 0.90 to 0.99 for observations with S$'( = 1, and in the range from
1.01 to 1.10 for observations with S$'( = -1. For our main results we specify j$'( as in (A.8).


   Appendix B. Log Returns
        In this appendix we demonstrate that the realized log return on an equally-weighted
portfolio is the average log return across assets in the portfolio to a first-order approximation.
Let C( , ..., C` denote the gross returns on ^ assets over a given period. The realized log equally-
weighted portfolio return is
                                           `                     `

where I* = ln C* . Given that I( =  = Iä = 0, then Ia = 0 and

                                               °Ia               1

Hence, to a first-order approximation around the point I( = IV =  = I` = 0,

   Appendix C. Dimson Adjusted Volatility
        In this Appendix we present a method to bias-adjust volatility when observed returns can
be characterized by the model of Dimson (1979), who presumes that securities trade intermittently
at the ends of specified periods. Similar to Dimson (1979), assume that observed index returns,
I$ , may be written as
                                                    ¢

                                           I$ =             E3 I$=3 + 6$                               (C.1)
                                                  3>?

where I$ represents the i.i.d. "true" portfolio return based on end of quarter values and 6$ is a mean
zero i.i.d. error term. From (D.1) it follows that
                                                             ¢

                                                                                                       (C.2)


or rather,
                                                            MNO I$ , I$=(

Let H and F denote the parameters of a linear projection of I$ on the contemporaneous market
return, Ix,$ . We can then write
                                                        ¢

                                       I$ = 8 +              £3 Ix,$=3 + á$                            (C.4)

where 8 is a constant, £3 = E3 F and á$ =         3>? §$=3         + 6$ is i.i.d. and mean zero. Dimson (1979)
             ¢                             ¢
assumes      3>( E3   = 1, which implies   3>( £3   = F .To estimate the variance us in (D.3) we jointly
                                                                                                  ¢
estimate MNO I$ , I$=( and £? , ... , £x by GMM. We then estimate E3 as E3 = £3 /                 3>? £3   and
compute the variance by scaling the auto-covariance as in (D.3). We use this volatility adjustment
when computing Sharpe raios and correlation as well. We compute standard errors for GHI I$
from the GMM covariance matrix of estimated parameters via the delta method.

   Appendix D. Data Details
         In this appendix we describe how we clean our data. From the transactions data we first
pull all records for which their "detailed strategy" is classified as "Buyout". We then identify
unique funds by their fund names, hand checking fund names that appear similar. We omit funds
labeled as parallel funds, feeder funds, annex funds, sub funds, top-up funds, duplicate funds, co-
investment funds, supplemental funds, and side-cars. We then clean the transactions data as
follows:
1)       Eliminate all funds with a total commitment less than $500M.
2)       Eliminate transactions with a price less than zero.
3)       Eliminate transactions with a NAV less than zero.
4)       Eliminate transactions that have the same price for every fund in the portfolio transaction.
6)       Eliminate transactions for which the total amount committed by the seller minus the
         unfunded commitment is less than zero.
7)       Eliminate transactions for which the total capital committed is less than or equal to zero.
8)       Eliminate transactions for which the fund name is missing.
9)       If multiple transactions occur on the most recent transaction date for a given fund/quarter,
         use only the transaction based on the highest total commitment.
10)      If multiple transaction records exist with the same fund name and commitment on the
         most recent transaction date for a given fund/quarter, choose one of these transactions at
         random as the transaction that represents the end-of-quarter transaction price.
12)      Eliminate all remaining transactions for which the price, as a percent of NAV, is greater
         than 3 standard deviations away from the mean price across funds for a given quarter.


After pulling data from Preqin for funds with a "category_type" equal to "Buyout", we clean the
data as follows:
1)       Eliminate any fund-quarters for which ^iG*,$=( = 0, or the NAV-based return is
         otherwise missing. Note that we retain records for which ^iG*,$ = 0. Once NAV hits
         zero, however, we no longer include the fund in the sample.
2)       Eliminate stale NAVs, those with a report date prior to 30 days before the end of each
         quarter.



                                                  44

3)       Identify fund-quarters for which the NAV-based return is greater than 3 standard
         deviations from the mean across all funds for a given quarter. These returns appear to be
         inconsistent with reported IRRs from Preqin.


         We then merge our Preqin data with the explanatory variables described in Table 2, and
then merge these data with the cleaned transactions dataset. To merge the transaction and cash-
flow data, we first identify funds with identical fund names in the two databases and designate
these as a match. We then identify fund names in the transaction and Preqin data that are
"similar" and that also have the same vintage. Fund names A and B are considered similar if
fund name A contains the first 5 characters of fund name B anywhere in the fund name string or
vice-versa. We then hand check this list to determine which funds match. After merging we
have data on 703 unique funds, 355 of which account for 955 transactions during our sample
period from March of 2006 through June of 2018.


   Appendix E. Synthetic Funds that Invest in Public Equities
          To create synthetic PE funds that invest in public equities, we first identify the timing of
flows for a "representative fund" that includes all funds in our secondary market-based PE index.
The index includes funds with recorded cash flows in Preqin from 2006 through 2018 with
vintages spanning from 1988 through 2018. Using this population of funds, we scale all fund
flows to a $1 commitment, align flows in fund-inception-time (as if they all made their initial
capital call at the same moment) and calculate the average net flows across funds each quarter
from fund inception to liquidation. We use NAV as a terminal value for funds not-yet liquidated
by the end of the sample, and eliminate funds with an initial capital call after December 31 2016.
These average flows represent the flows of our representative fund and are illustrated in Appendix
Figure E1. The initial capital call in our sample averages about 9 cents and average drawdowns
in subsequent quarters fall in the range of 3 to 5 cents. Average net flows first turn positive in
quarter 14 when funds are almost 4 years old, and climb to a peak of 5.02 cents at quarter 28 when
funds are almost 7 years old. Net flows then slowly decline to zero. The longest lasting fund in
our sample paid out its last distribution in the 87th quarter following its initial capital call. The
average fund in our sample lasts between 9 and 10 years.



                                                  45

         Using the flows of the representative fund, we then use the approach of Korteweg and
Nagel (2016) to create the cash flows for a series of replicating funds that invest in public equities.
These authors develop this methodology to create benchmark funds to use in estimating SDF
parameters when calculating GPME. We initially use the same methodology for a different
purpose, to create the cash flows of synthetic funds that we wish to evaluate and price.
         We first sort stocks into size deciles each month, and for each decile, create the cash flows
for 59 artificial funds that make capital calls and invest the acquired capital into the assigned size
decile portfolio. Funds start with a cash flow of zero at the end of June or December of their given
initial year, peHI* , and respectively make their first capital call at the end of September of peHI*
or March of peHI* + 1. For example, fund 1 makes its first capital call at the end of March, 1980,
fund 2 makes its first capital call at the end of September, 1980, and so forth, with the last fund,
fund 59, making its first capital call March of 2009. Following the algorithm, capital calls each
quarter are identical to those of the representative fund in fund-inception time. If the representative
fund makes a payout at the end of quarter · in fund-inception time, the artificial funds also make
payouts at the end of quarter · equal to the sum of two components. The first component is equal
to the return accumulated since the last quarter in which a call or distribution was made. The
second component is equal to a fraction, Q¶ , of the remaining capital under management with
                                                    ·--
                                        Q¶ = min           ,1                                    (5)
                                                    40 - -
where - is the time of the most recent payout prior to quarter ·, measured in fund-inception time
quarters. If the payout at quarter · is the fund's first payout, then - = 0. This assumption sets the
life of each artificial fund to 10 years, and for our setup implies that the 59th fund pays its final
distribution December of 2018. We proceed in this manner to create the overlapping cash flows
for 59 artificial funds that invest capital in their assigned size-decile portfolio, and then repeat this
exercise for all 10 deciles.



   Appendix F. An Application: "Matrix Pricing" of Private Equity Funds

         Most funds are valued by limited partners at the NAV, which can deviate substantially
from the best available estimate of the fund's underlying value. These valuations are used for a
number of purposes by investors in funds, including portfolio allocation decisions across asset


                                                   46

classes, and spending decisions, which are usually set by investors as a fixed percentage of a
portfolio's assessed value. Examples of this policy approach include universities and
foundations. More accurate pricing of limited partner stakes in private equity funds may
improve the ability of investors to make investment decisions since it may lead to portfolio
allocations and spending rules corresponding to better estimates of the underlying values of an
institution's private equity investments.

        One possible approach to value stakes in private equity funds more accurately is to follow
a procedure similar to "Matrix Pricing," commonly used to price bonds, by which the prices of
bonds that do not trade are determined based on the prices of bonds that do. The idea is that the
same fundamentals affect similar bonds in the same manner, so prices of bonds that do not trade
likely move approximately the same amount as prices of similar bonds that do trade. Since private
equity funds that invest in one type of asset are likely affected by a number of the same shocks to
their fundamentals, they can be priced using comparable methods with transactions-based indices.
        For any fund, the fund's history of quarterly cash inflows and outflows can be combined
with the quarterly returns of the hedonic indices to calculate market values. Beginning at the end
of some chosen quarter 1 we set fund value for fund " , G*,$ , equal to ^iG . Then for all subsequent
quarters we estimate fund value as
                                     G*,$  = G*,$=( (1 + I$ ) + M*,$ - ó*,$ ,                              (F.1)
where M$ and ó$ denote capital calls and distributions between times 1 and 1 + 1,and I$ represents
the simple return on our market-based index.
        We perform this calculation for each fund in our sample for every quarter in our sample
period (2006 to 2018). One version of our market-based index is formed using transactions from
funds that are between four and nine years old and we use this version of the index to calculate
market values for four-to-nine-year-old funds. Following the procedure described above, we set
market value equal to NAV at the end of the fourth year following each fund's vintage year and
iterate forward to identify market values at the end of subsequent quarters.23 We report year-end
aggregate market-to-book ratios by vintage in Appendix Table F1 by summing year-end market




23
 For the 2005 vintage, we set NAV equal to market value at the end of year three due to irregularities in reported
NAVs associated with the financial crisis.

                                                         47

values for each fund for a given vintage and dividing by the sum of year-end NAVs for the same
set of funds.24
           Aggregate market-to-book ratios for each vintage across time are reported in the bottom of
Appendix Table F1. The average ranges from a low of 0.90 for the 2002 vintage of funds to high
of 1.16 for 2004 vintage. Market-to-book ratios are considerably lower during the Financial Crisis,
ranging between 0.67 and 0.79 in 2008 for the 3 vintages that were old enough for our hedonic
estimation. Funds that invested out of 2007 and 2008 vintage funds did so at lower valuations, and
therefore have high average market-to-book ratios in subsequent years when markets recovered.
For example, these estimates indicate that by the end of 2015, a 2007 buyout fund has a NAV that
is understated by 14% relative to its market value.
           Individual funds could mark their values to market using the approach in one of two ways.
The most accurate approach would be to generate fund-specific market values using the estimated
coefficients from the pricing models applied to the fund's attributes. A simpler approach, but one
that nonetheless represents a substantial improvement over using NAVs, is to multiply the NAV
of each of LP's investments by the average market-to-book ratio of the industry. For example, an
LP would multiply the NAV of each four-to-nine-year-old fund in his or her portfolio by the
appropriate ratio from Appendix Table F1. For younger funds, the deviation between NAVs and
market value is likely to be smaller but could be estimated using the coefficients from the pricing
model. Tail-end funds will have only a few portfolio companies left and their values will vary
depending on the fortunes of these particular investments. As such, this approach is likely to be
less useful for valuing these funds.




24
     The 2018 market-to-book ratio is reported as of Q2 because of data availability.

This table reports the slope coefficient in Campbell-Shiller regressions as described in the paper. In Panel A the dependent variables are measured
at a quarterly (non-overlapping) horizon. In Panel B, dependent variables are measured at an annual horizon, and in Panel C, dependent variables
are measured at a five-year horizon. We compute Hanson-Hodrick (1983) standard errors to account for overlapping data. Significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels is indicated, respectively, by "***", "**", and "*".

                           Table 6. Performance Metrics for Unlevered Synthetic Funds that Invest in Small-Cap Stocks

This table reports performance metrics for the set of synthetic funds we create. We sort stocks into size deciles each month and create the flows for
a set of synthetic funds using the algorithm of Korteweg and Nagel (2016) that separately invest capital in one of the size decile value-weighted
portfolios. For each decile, we create a set of funds that make initial capital calls at the end of June and December of each year from December
1979 through December 1984. Each fund invests the acquired capital into their assigned size decile portfolio. For each set of funds, column (2)
reports the average IRR, and column (3) reports the GPME of Korteweg and Nagel (2016). Column (5) reports the average risk-neutral discounted
abnormal profits across funds in each set. Column (7) reports the standard CAPM alpha for each decile portfolio. Significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% levels is indicated, respectively, by "***", "**", and "*".

                                                 Appendix Figure 1. Cash Flows for the Representative Fund

This figure illustrates the cash flows of the representative fund we use to create synthetic funds that invest in stock deciles. These cash flows are the
average cash flows of all funds in our index based on fund-inception time. We build our index using funds with recorded cash flows in Preqin from
2006 through 2018 with vintages spanning from 1988 through 2016. We scale all fund flows to a $1 commitment, align flows in fund-inception-
time (as if they all made their initial capital call at the same moment) and calculate the average net flows across funds each quarter from fund
inception to liquidation. We use NAV as a terminal value for funds not-yet liquidated by the end of the sample.




                                                                           57

                                      Appendix Table 1. Robustness Checks

In this table we report main index parameters of interest for different versions of the model and for different methods
of estimating index parameters. All expected returns and alphas are annualized. In Panel A we report index parameters
for log returns after adjusting alpha as in Cochrane (2005) and Axelson, Sorensen, and Stromberg (2014)¸ ! = # +
 (1/2)*+, - (1/2)*.   ,
                        + /(1 - /)  where # denotes the intercept in a regression of log excess index returns on log
excess market returns, *+, denotes the Dimson-adjusted index variance (see Appendix C), *.        ,
                                                                                                    denotes the market
variance, and / denotes the Dimson-adjusted index beta using one lag. All other panels report results using simple
(exponentiated) returns after Dimson adjusting as discussed in the text and Appendix C. In Panel B we eliminate
insignificant variables from the pricing equation as reported in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 before constructing the
index and estimating index parameters. In Panels C and D we replace state variables in both the pricing and selection
equation with quarterly fixed effects. In Panel C we use the estimated FE from the prior quarter for the two quarters
with no transactions (Q3/2007 and Q1/2013). In Panel D we delete the two quarters with missing transactions. This
causes use to lose four index return observations. In Panels E and F we replace state variables in both the pricing and
selection equation with quarterly fixed effects and eliminate all other variables from the pricing equation. In Panel E
we use the estimated FE from the prior quarter for the two quarters with no transactions. In Panel F we delete the two
quarters with missing transactions. Standard errors are estimated by GMM using the Newey West (1987) estimate of
the spectral density matrix, along with the delta method. Significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level of significance is
indicated by "***", "**", and "*" respectively.

                               Appendix Table 2. Aggregate Market-to-Book Ratios of Private Equity Investments

This table reports year-end average market-to-book ratios. Market values for each fund are calculated using the following procedure. We begin by assuming that
the market value of the fund is equal to NAV in years one through four of the fund's life. We then calculate the market value each quarter from years 5-9 for fund
i using the following formula:
                                                              !",$  = !",$'( (1 + ,-,$ ) + /",$ - 1",$ ,

where !",$ is equal to the 23! of fund i at time t. /$ and 1$ denote capital calls and distributions between times 4 and 4 + 1,and ,-,$ represents the return on our
hedonic transaction-based index. For the first quarter in year five, we use NAV as the preceding quarter's market value. The aggregate market-to-book ratio
reported in this table is calculated as the sum of the individual fund's market value within each quarter divided by the sum of the individual fund's NAV in each
quarter. We report the resultant market-to-book ratio for Q4 of each year, with the exception of 2018, where we report values as of Q2 due to data limitations.
