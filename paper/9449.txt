Testing Theories of Discrimination: Evidence from Weakest Link
Steven D. Levitt
NBER Working Paper No. 9449
January 2003
JEL No. J71

                                             ABSTRACT

        In most settings, it is difficult to measure discrimination, and even more challenging to
distinguish between competing theories of discrimination (taste-based versus information-based).
Using contestant voting behavior on the television game show Weakest Link, one can in principle

empirically address both of these questions. On the show, contestants answer questions and vote off
other players, competing for a winner-take-all prize. In early rounds, strategic incentives encourage

voting for the weakest competitors. In later rounds, the incentives reverse, and the strongest
competitors become the logical target. Controlling for other observable characteristics including the
number of correct answers thus far, both theories of discrimination predict that in early rounds,
excess votes will be made against groups targeted for discrimination. In later rounds, however, taste-

based models predict continued excess votes, whereas statistical discrimination predicts fewer votes
against the target group. Empirically, I find some evidence of information-based discrimination
towards Hispanics (i.e., other players perceive them as having low ability) and taste-based

discrimination against older players (i.e., other players treat them with animus). There is little in the
data to suggest discrimination against women and Blacks.

       Discrimination features prominently in American history. The leading target of

discrimination has been Blacks, whether in the form of slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, or

other guises. Asians have also been the target of severe discrimination historically, as have

women. In modern society, the extent of discrimination is less clear. Some data suggest that

discrimination may still be at work. For instance, large racial gaps remain on many social

indicators such as income, education, and life expectancy (Blank 2001), and women continue to

earn far less than men on average in the labor force. On the other hand, legislation now provides

legal protection against discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and age. Along some

dimensions, discrimination appears less pronounced. For instance, between 1970 and 1990 the

number of Black-White interracial marriages more than tripled. In addition, women and minorities

have increasingly come to occupy prominent positions in politics, business, and the media.

Viewed in this light, the current racial and gender economic gaps may be the consequence of past

discrimination, rather than a reflection of current discriminatory practices.

       To the extent that discrimination persists, understanding the source of that discrimination is

of first-order importance. There are two leading theories of discrimination (see Fryer 2001 for a

detailed survey). The first theory is based on tastes, and originates with Becker (1957). In the

taste-based story, some economic actors prefer not to interact with a particular class of people and

are willing to pay a financial cost to avoid such interactions. The other leading explanation is

based on incomplete information. The simplest information-based model involves one group

having mistaken beliefs about another group’s skill level and acting accordingly. That simple

model, while perhaps a reasonable description of behavior, is not a very satisfying economic

model because it implies that individuals are making systematic errors. A series of more

sophisticated information-based statistical discrimination models circumvent that criticism (Phelps

                                                  1
1972, Arrow 1973, Aigner and Cain 1977, Lundberg and Startz 1983, Coate and Loury 1993,

Fryer and Jackson 2002). In these models, individuals (typically employers) discriminate against

particular groups either because (1) signals of ability are less informative within that group or, (2)

in the presence of human capital investment, equilibria exist in which negative prior beliefs about

members of a particular group become self-fulfilling. In models of statistical discrimination,

economic actors have no animus (unlike taste-based models), but discriminatory outcomes

nonetheless arise.

          Measuring the extent of discrimination poses a difficult empirical challenge.1 Self-report

data are unlikely to accurately reflect attitudes if there is a perceived stigma attached to racist

views.2       A number of different approaches have been employed in an attempt to address this

question. One method, known as the “audit study” uses matched pairs of individuals of different

races who masquerade as consumers or job hunters.3 Using this methodology, for instance, Ayres

and Siegelman (1995) find that car dealerships attempt to charge higher prices to Blacks and

women. Bertrand and Mullanaithan (2002) find that resumes carrying distinctively Black names

are less likely to receive job interviews. A second approach to the empirical study of

presented here, see Altonji and Blank (1999).
          2
          As one vivid example, Howell and Sims (1994) analyze the Louisiana Gubernatorial
election in which White supremacist politician David Duke received far more votes than pre-
election surveys and exit polls had predicted. Kuklinski et al. (1997), using a clever methodology
designed to minimize self-reporting issues, find no evidence of discrimination towards Blacks
outside the South, but substantial racism among White southerners.
          3
          Heckman and Siegelman (1992) criticize audit studies on the grounds that the simulated
discriminatory transactions that occur in audit studies would be unlikely to arise in a market
economy, i.e. Blacks may not shop for cars at all-White car dealerships because they fear being
discriminated against. If that is the case, then in the real world, the consequences of discrimination
will be far less than suggested by the audit study.the

                                                   2
discrimination is to compare salaries to marginal products of labor for Blacks and Whites. These

studies are most commonly performed for athletes, where salaries are known and “output” is

relatively easy to quantify (e.g., Kahn 1991). Mixed evidence of discrimination is found in this

literature, with some studies finding salary and customer discrimination against Blacks,

particularly in basketball. Knowles, Persico, and Todd (2001), analyzing outcomes of drug

searches following police stops, find no evidence of racial bias. In general, empirical tests have a

difficult time distinguishing between taste-based and information-based models of discrimination. 4

        In this paper, I try to both measure the extent of discrimination and distinguish between

competing theories using an unusual data source: contestant behavior on the television game show

“Weakest Link.”5 On this show, contestants answer trivia questions over a series of rounds, with

one contestant eliminated each round based on the votes of the other contestants, until only two

contestants remain. The last two contestants compete head-to-head for the winner-take-all prize.

Because the prize money at stake is large (as much as $190,000 on a single show), participants

have powerful incentives to vote in a manner that maximizes their chance of winning.

        The total prize money is an increasing function of the number of questions that are

answered correctly over the course of the program. As a consequence, there is a strong incentive



        4
           Altonji and Pierret (2001) present a clever methodology for ferreting out statistical
discrimination using information about how wages change with employment tenure. They find
little evidence of statistical discrimination on the basis of race.
        5
            After the first draft of this paper was written, it came to my attention that another group of
researchers were independently collecting Weakest Link data to answer questions about
discrimination (Antonovics, Arcidiacono, and Walsh 2002). Their research also concludes that
there is little evidence of discrimination towards Blacks and women. They do not analyze
discrimination towards Hispanics or the elderly.
         See Gertner (1993) and Metrick (1995) for other economic analyses using game shows as
a vehicle.

                                                    3
to vote off the least skilled players in the early rounds.6 Both taste-based and statistical

discrimination theories would predict that discrimination will manifest itself as an increased

propensity to vote off the group that is discriminated against early in the game, conditional on other

observables such as the number of questions answered correctly up to that point in the show, or the

individual’s education (which may predict future skill in answering questions).7

       As the end of the show nears, however, strategic incentives switch. The value of building

the prize pool becomes outweighed by the question of whether a contestant can beat another

contestant in a head-to-head challenge. Ideally, one would like to be competing against a low-skill

opponent in the final round to increase one’s chance of winning the final prize. In the late rounds,

the two theories discussed above offer different predictions about how discriminators will behave.

In the taste-based models, those who discriminate towards a group do so not because they think

that group is less talented, but rather, because they do not like them. Thus, one would expect that a

taste-based discriminator would continue to disproportionately vote against the target group in the

late rounds. In information-based models, on the other hand, discriminators perceive the other

group as less qualified. Thus, in the late rounds, such discriminators will avoid voting for

members of the group that is viewed as less qualified, in order to raise the probability that the final



       6
          The set of information about other competitors is fairly limited. In addition to observing
the performance of each contestant in answering questions up to that point in the game, players also
announce their age, occupation, and home town. The contestants can also see one another, and
therefore can observe race, gender, and other visual cues, such as degree of physical
attractiveness.
       7
         Statistical discrimination models arising as a consequence of minorities having noisier
signals will not necessarily generate this pattern. In those models, noisy signals result in
minorities being less likely to be perceived as being in the tail of the distribution (both upper and
lower). As a consequence, minorities may be less likely to be voted off in early rounds in such a
model.

                                                   4
opponent will be from that group, increasing the perceived likelihood that the discriminator will

win the prize. Consequently, voting behavior in the late rounds provides a unique opportunity to

empirically distinguish between the two competing models.8

       There are a number of important caveats concerning the applicability of these game show

patterns to everyday behavior. First, the setting examined is not a market. Unlike in the real

world, the contestants have little choice with respect to whom they are interacting. Second, the

individuals who appear on this game show are highly selected, both with respect to who applies to

be on the show and who is chosen to be on the show. Little is known about the precise nature of

the selection process. It is clear, however, that those who appear on the show are not

representative of the underlying populations. For instance, the education levels of Whites, Blacks,

and Hispanics appearing the show are nearly identical, whereas there are big differences in mean

education levels for these groups in the overall population. Third, the voting is taking place in

front of a televised audience. Just as racist individuals lie about whether they voted for David

Duke in an exit pool, they may be loath to broadcast racist views on a television game show.

Finally, the decision about whom to vote for depends not just on one’s own views, but also about

one’s beliefs as to how other contestants will vote. Race may serve as a focal point in a setting in

which multiple equilibria exist, exaggerating the amount of measured discrimination. Thus,

someone who is not racist, but believes others are racist, will have incentives to vote for Blacks in

the early rounds.

       With those important caveats in mind, the empirical findings reveal little systematic



       8
       In either model of discrimination, there is another potential factor at work: losing to
someone in the target group may be especially embarrassing, increasing the inventive to eliminate
members of that group towards the end of the game.

                                                  5
evidence of discrimination towards Blacks, Asians, or women. The number of votes cast against

these groups are similar to the numbers for White males. Hispanics and the elderly, however, do

appear to face systematic discrimination on the show. These two groups consistently receive more

votes (which is a bad thing) early in the show than other contestants, even after controlling for

other factors such as education level and performance in answering questions up to that point in the

game. The data are consistent with an information-based discrimination story for Hispanics. In

the final round, Hispanics are significantly less likely to receive votes – a reversal from earlier

rounds. For the elderly, the discrimination appears to be taste based. Even in the final round, the

elderly receive significantly more votes than other contestants, controlling for relevant factors.

There is also some tendency in the data for individuals to vote less frequently for members of their

own group. For instance, women vote more frequently for men and vice-versa. Blacks tend to

vote less for other Blacks than would be expected. The exception to this rule is the elderly, who

are more likely to vote for other elderly than are contestants in general.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides greater

background on the television show Weakest Link. Section III discusses in more detail the strategic

considerations players face. Section IV presents the empirical results. Section V concludes.



Section II: Background on Weakest Link

       Weakest Link is a television game show in which contestants compete against one another

to obtain a winner-take-all prize. Each round, contestants take turns answering trivia questions,

with the goal to build a “chain” of answers. The more consecutive correct answers given, the

greater the prize. Prize money builds slowly for the first few correct answers and much more



                                                  6
quickly when many consecutive correct answer have been assembled.9 Before hearing a question,

the contestant has the opportunity to “bank” the money in the current chain. If the contestant

chooses to “bank,” then the money assembled in the current chain is added to the final prize pool

and the team starts over in building a chain. An incorrect answer also causes the chain-building to

start over, but all of the money assembled in the current chain is lost, rather than added to the final

prize money.10 At the conclusion of each round, contestants secretly record the player who they

would like to vote off. There is no communication between players after the conclusion of

questions and prior to the casting of the votes. The votes, along with the identities of the

individuals casting the votes, are then revealed. The competitor who receives the most votes is

eliminated from the show (the “weakest link”), no longer answering questions and ineligible for

the final prize. In the case of a tie, the contestant who had the most correct answers that round (the

“strongest link”) determines which of the players with the most votes will be eliminated. This

process continues until only two contestants remain, at which point they play one more round as a

team trying to raise the final prize (the only round in which no player is voted off), and then

compete head-to-head in a final round to determine who keeps the prize. The winner is the

contestant that answers the most questions correctly in the final round. If the players are tied at the

end of the final round, questions are asked until one player provides a correct answer and the other



        9
         On the prime time show, the first correct answer is worth $1,000, the next answer
$2,500, and the progression continues: $5,000, $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, $75,000, $125,000.
On the day time show, the value of answers is as follows: $250, $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000,
$12,500.
        10
           The tradeoff involved in the decision to “bank” is that an additional correct answer has
a bigger payoff if one does not “bank,” but the cost of an incorrect answer is also greater.
Examining contestant behavior regarding the “bank” decision is of potential interest, but my data
set does not contain information on who banked.

                                                   7
an incorrect answer. The time devoted to answering questions decreases each round.

         Two different versions of the show are included in the data set used in this paper. The

program originally aired as a one-hour prime time show involving eight competitors, eight rounds

(seven in which one player is eliminated, and the penultimate round in which no players are voted

off), and a theoretical maximum total prize of $1 million. Later, the show was transformed into a

syndicated 30 minute daytime show with six competitors, six rounds, and a theoretical maximum

total prize of $75,000.11 In practice, the total prize money earned is well below the theoretical

maximum. The median payout is roughly $80,000 in the prime time version, and $10,000 in the day

time version.

         The data were collected by video recording the televised programs and transcribing the

results. The data set includes almost every prime time show except for those involving celebrities

(e.g. a Brady Bunch reunion show) and virtually every day time show aired prior to January

2003.12 There are a total of 25 prime time shows and 136 day time shows. Each prime time show

yields 8 person-level observations, 33 person-votes (eight in the first round, seven in the second

round, ..., 3 in the 6th round). Each day time show yields 6 person-level observations, 18 person-

votes. Thus, in total, the data set includes 1,016 person-level observations and 3,273 person-

votes.


         11
           Toward the end of the sample, the round in which the last two remaining competitors
play cooperatively to build the pool was eliminated. Because there is no voting in that round, it is
not used in my analysis, so the change in format is immaterial.
         12
          The prime time show no longer airs. Data collection is ongoing on the day time show
and future versions of this paper will be updated to reflect the additional data.
       A few shows are missing due to human error regarding recording of the shows, but data for
every show that was successfully recorded are in the sample. There is no reason to believe that
the missing shows would exhibit any systematic bias since the outcomes of the shows are not
known at the point when the failure to record the show occurs.

                                                  8
       Table 1 presents summary statistics for the data set The top panel of the panel reports data

at the contestant level. Roughly 20 percent of the contestants are Black. Asians and Hispanics

represent a much smaller fraction of the players (2.9 and 2.2 percent respectively).13 Players are

almost evenly distributed between males and females. Approximately 7 percent of the contestants

are fifty years or older (the mean age is 34). Contestant self-reports of occupation were crudely

categorized according to the likely education level of the players: high school, college,

professional school, doctorate, still in school, and unknown (assigned to those contestants whose

occupation is missing, unemployed, retired without specifying an earlier occupation, or stay-at-

home parent). Roughly one-third of the contestants perform jobs that require no more than a high-

school education (although many of them may nonetheless have higher levels of education). Over

forty percent are classified as college educated, with an additional eight percent having

professional degrees (e.g. law) and another 3.6 percent with doctorates (PhD or MD).

       The second panel of Table 1 reports game statistics at the level of the contestant-round.

These statistics are presented for the show as a whole, as well as for early, middle, and late

rounds of each program. 14 Overall, each contestant is asked between two and three questions per

round, with that number rising in later rounds. The success rate for answering questions is slightly

above 60 percent.


       13
          Because of some ambiguity in visual assessments of race, the category labeled
“Hispanic” is actually a catch-all category for non-Black, non-White, non-Asian contestants which
includes a small number of Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, as well as Hispanics.
       The producers of the show appear to have made a concerted effort to include minorities on
each show. Of 161 shows in the sample, only four lack a minority contestant.
       14
           Early rounds correspond to the first two rounds of the prime time show (one hour long)
and the first round of the day time show (30 minutes long). Middle rounds correspond to rounds 3-
5 of the prime time show and rounds 2 and 3 of the day time show. Final round corresponds to
round 6 of the prime time show and round 4 of the day time show.

                                                  9
       Also reported in Table 1 are statistics reporting the deviation of that player from other

contestants on the same show in the percent of questions answered correctly this round and

cumulatively up until that point in the show, as well as the number of votes for a contestant. The

means of these variables are not themselves interesting. By definition the mean deviation from

other players on the episode is equal to zero. Similarly, since each player casts one vote in each

round, the mean number of votes must be equal to one. The standard deviations of these variables,

however, will be of use in interpreting the regression estimates.



Section III: Strategic considerations of contestants

       The primary strategic decision that a player faces is for whom to vote.15 The complexity of

the situation precludes a formal model. Within each round there as many as eight contestants and

as many as seven possible targets for whom to vote. The optimal action for any one player

depends critically on the beliefs about how other players will vote. There is nothing a priori that

suggests that pure strategy equilibria should be the norm. Most critically, voting behavior in every

round except the first will be a function not only of observable characteristics and performance

thus far in the game, but also of past voting. Given that players have perhaps 30 seconds to

determine their votes after the completion of each round, it is implausible that they could perform a

rigorous optimization anyway. Rather, they must rely on rules of thumb or subjective criteria in

determining their votes.

       Absent a formal model, it is nonetheless possible to map out four broad considerations that

arise in considering how to vote. The first consideration relates to building the size of the prize


       15
          As noted earlier, the question of whether or not to “bank” also poses a question of
decision making under uncertainty, but not one that is addressed in this paper.

                                                  10
pool. Players have a collective interest in having as many correct answers as possible in order to

generate the biggest prize. Thus, one would like to vote off players who give correct answers with

low probability. The minimum expected value of a correct answer, assuming optimal banking

strategies, is the lowest payoff for a correct answer: $1,000 in the prime time show and $125 in

the day time show. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the actual expected value of a

correct answer will be at least three times higher, since rewards rise substantially when

consecutive correct responses are tallied.16 Players who survive to the final round are on average

asked approximately 24 questions total. Thus, differences in ability can have a substantial impact

on the final pool: thousands of dollars in the day time game and tens of thousands of dollars in the

prime time game. The incentive to vote off poor players because of this channel is greatest in the

earliest rounds since later in the game there are fewer questions remaining to be answered, so the

opportunity cost of having a bad player alive decreases proportionally.

       The second consideration when voting is the desire to eliminate strong players in order to

maximize the likelihood that you will win in the head-to-head contest in the final round. On the

prime time show, the final round consists of five questions per player. A contestant with a 20

percentage point edge in answering questions (e.g. 70 percent correct answers versus an opponent


       16
          The precise value of a correct answer varies depending on whether the preceding and
following questions are answered correctly and how frequently players “bank.” Assuming that
players are risk neutral (see Metrick 1995) and bank money optimally, a lower bound on the
expected value of a correct answer can be arrived under the assumption contestants never bank:
they simply answer questions until they complete the chain (at which time the money is
automatically banked) or until a wrong answer is given. Assuming that the average probability of
a correct answer is .60, the expected value of a correct answer is roughly $3,500 in the prime time
show and $900 in the day time show. For the prime time show, the payoff for eight straight correct
answers is $125,000, and the probability that any one answer is pivotal is 1/.6^7; for the day time
show, the payoff to six straight correct answers is $12,500, and the probability that any one answer
is pivotal is 1/.6^5. If banking is done optimally, a risk-neutral player will only bank if it increases
the expected value of the pool, making this a lower bound.

                                                  11
with 50 percent correct) will win the final round about 80 percent of the time. On the day time

version, the final round is only three questions which introduces more randomness, but the skilled

player continues to win the great majority of the time. Moreover, empirically, performance in the

early rounds of the show is a powerful predictor of who will answer questions correctly in the

final round: the player with the higher fraction of questions correct going into the final round wins

64 percent of the time. Thus, towards the end of the game, the desire to eliminate strong

competitors becomes paramount in importance.

        The third consideration relates to the impact that your vote has on other’s voting behavior

towards you. In a given round, it is dangerous to vote against players who have answered many

questions correctly and thus will be the “strongest link” and cast the deciding vote in the case of a

tie. Given the speed with which questions are asked, as well as some apparent randomness in who

is declared the strongest link on the show, it is difficult for contestants to know precisely who the

strongest link is in any one round.17 Thus, in general there is incentive to shy away from voting for

players who have done well in this round, aside from the first two considerations discussed in the

preceding paragraphs. In addition, in describing their motivations for why players vote for one

another, the fact that another contestant voted for them in a previous round is frequently mentioned.

Therefore, to the extent that one is successful in voting for players who receive many votes, the

contestant increases his or her likelihood of survival. This is both because the target of the votes

is less likely to remain alive in the next round, and because even if the target survives, if he or she

received multiple votes, retribution cannot be delivered to all of those who targeted him or her in


        17
           In the frequent cases in which multiple competitors tie for having the most correct
answers in a given round, the next criterion used is the percent of answers correct in that round
(i.e. players who were asked more questions are penalized). When a tie remains, the allocation
rule used is unclear.

                                                  12
the previous round. Relative to the other two channels, it is less clear how this final consideration

varies by round. It is likely, however, that this set of concerns are of reduced importance in the

final round of voting, since there will be no later opportunity for the party voted against to exact

revenge. In light of the tie-breaking power of the strongest link, incentive to avoid the player who

answered the most questions correctly persists in the final round (but only for the two contestants

who are not the strongest link in the last round).

        The final consideration is the pressure applied by the show’s host to vote off the weakest

link. Before each vote, the host exhorts the players to eliminate the weakest link. Players who

vote for strong competitors rather than the weakest link are often singled out by the host in the

repartee that follows each vote. That sort of attention is unwanted because it provides a possible

focal point for other players to coordinate their votes in the next round. This message is most

pronounced just before the final vote, in which the host, acknowledging the importance of the

second consideration above in the late rounds, implores the contestants to “have the courage” to

vote off the weakest link.

        Given the informality of the discussion above, the empirical predictions one can derive are

somewhat circumscribed. Ignoring for the moment the third and fourth consideration

(repercussions of one’s vote and attempts at moral suasion), the prize-building channel

unambiguously weakens over time and the weak-final-round-opponent channel unambiguously

grows over time. Both of these factors, therefore, point to an increasing tendency to vote against

stronger players over time. At least in the final round, the third consideration (repercussion of

one’s vote) also would suggest an increased likelihood of voting against a strong player. Only the

fourth consideration serves to moderate this tendency. Thus, it seems plausible that in the early

rounds, the optimal strategy is slanted towards voting off weak players, whereas at the end (at

                                                     13
least in relative terms), the incentives to vote off strong players are greater.

        The issue of whether weak or strong players are the target is critical to differentiating

taste-based and information-based models of discrimination. In a taste-based model, the

discriminatory behavior is not predicated on beliefs about the target of discrimination’s talent

level. Thus, one would expect a tendency to vote against the discriminated group throughout all

rounds. In an information-based model, on the other hand, the discrimination arises from beliefs

regarding the talent level of the discriminated group. The discriminator believes that the target

group has lower ability, controlling for observable characteristics, and thus should be more likely

vote against that group in early rounds, but less likely to vote against that group towards the end,

when the desire to face a weak final round opponent becomes paramount.



Section IV: Empirical Results

        Table 2 presents raw data on the number of votes received as a function of contestant

characteristics in early, middle, and final rounds of the game. For the average player, one vote

would be the expectation. Receiving a vote is a bad outcome, because the player with the most

votes is eliminated. Comparing males and females in the first two columns, the numbers are

similar across gender in all three rounds, with women weakly less likely to receive votes at each

stage. Thus, there is no evidence in these numbers of discrimination against women on the show.

Comparing across races in columns 3-6, Blacks have a slightly elevated rate of vote receipt in the

early rounds, and slightly depressed rate in the middle and final rounds. In no instance, however,

are Black and White rates statistically distinguishable. Asians are the one group that stand out in

terms of how proficient they are in answer questions (Asians answer correctly approximately 65

percent of the time, four percentage points higher than any other racial group in the sample), so one

                                                   14
might expect that in the raw data they would be voted off less frequently in the early and middle

rounds, but more at the end. That pattern, however, does not appear.18 Hispanics receive high

rates of votes in the early and middle rounds, but very low rates in the final round, potentially

consistent with information-based models of discrimination. It is important to note, however, that

there are a small number of observations for Hispanics, making the estimates imprecise.

Contestants aged 50 and over receive excess votes at all three stages of the game, suggesting the

possibility of taste-based discrimination.

       The simple statistics in Table 2 may be misleading if contestants systematically differ

along other observable dimensions such as their occupation or the skill with which they answer

questions. Regression estimates of the following form are therefore estimated:

(1)    Votecre = Xce’? + Zcre’? + ?r + ?cre

where c, r, and e index contestants, rounds, and episodes respectively. Vote is the number of votes

a contestant receives. The specifications include a set of fixed contestant characteristics X (such

as race, gender, age, educational level, region of residence), as well as variables that change by

round (like measures of how well the player answered questions in current and previous rounds).

In addition, fixed effects for each round are also included, with prime time rounds and day time

rounds treated as different (i.e., there is a dummy for the first round of a prime time show and a

separate dummy for the first round of a day time show).19



       18
           The percent of correct answers is very similar for all other races. Men are 2 percent
more likely to provide correct answers on average than women. Contestants age 50 and over
correctly answer 2 percent fewer of their questions than the typical player.
       19
         The results reported are from ordinary least squares. Negative binomial specifications
which incorporate the fact that the dependent variable is a count variable, yield virtually identical
results.

                                                  15
        The results of the regressions are reported in Table 3, with early, middle, and final rounds

analyzed separately. Specifications with a minimal set of covariates are presented in the odd

columns; fuller specifications are shown in the even columns. Before turning to the coefficients of

primary interest (gender, race, and age), it is important to first note that the conjectures regarding

player strategy are largely confirmed in the data. In early and middle rounds, poor performance

leads to substantial increases in votes. The inclusion of squared terms capturing non-linearities in

how voting responds to correct answers makes it difficult to interpret the raw coefficients on these

variables; evaluating the impact on votes of a player being one standard deviation above or below

the mean aids in the interpretation. In the early rounds, a player one standard deviation below the

mean in correct answers this round receives approximately one vote more than a contestant who is

one standard deviation above the mean – a large impact given that the mean number of votes

received per round is one. In the middle rounds, that same comparison yields a gap in votes of

.82. In addition, in the middle rounds a contestant one standard deviation below the mean on

cumulative performance prior to this round garners an extra .25 votes relative to a player one

standard deviation above the mean. In the final round, however, the picture is very different.

Slightly more votes are received if one performs poorly this round (about .20, consistent with the

incentive not to vote for the strongest link in the final round because of the tie-breaking power).

The tendency to punish bad cumulative performance disappears. There is no difference in the

number of votes received for a player one standard deviation above and below the mean in

cumulative performance up to the final round. Given the powerful incentive to vote off strong

players at the end, it is surprising that good players in past rounds receive the same number of

final-round votes (instead of more votes). Either the players succumb to the host’s admonitions to

vote for the weakest player, the contestants are not very skilled at determining who the most

                                                  16
successful player has been to date, or they (incorrectly) believe past performance is not a good

predictor of future success.

       The other strategic variable in the regression, the cumulative number of opponents voted

for who are still alive, captures the “revenge” motive. This variable enters with the expected sign

in all three parts of the game and is statistically significant in the middle and final rounds. Each

extra opponent how you unsuccessfully tried to vote off in the past translates into between .09 and

.27 extra votes against you in the current round.

       The coefficients on education (not presented in the table) provide further confirmation of

the shift in voting behavior in the final round. The only education category that consistently differs

from the others is doctors. Controlling for other factors in the regressions, players with a

doctorate receive substantially fewer votes than any other education category in early rounds

(about .25 less per round), but receive more votes than any other category in the final round (about

.15 votes more on average). This result is consistent with players perceiving that these highly

educated contestants are strong players, even after controlling for observed performance up to this

time.20 Overall, the models are not particularly successful in explaining voting patterns, with R2

values ranging from .013 to .387.

       For the most part, the regression results with respect to gender, race, and age mirror the

findings that appeared in the raw data. In all specifications, women receive weakly fewer votes

than men (the omitted category), although in no case is the difference across gender statistically

significant. The differences between Blacks and Whites (the excluded group) fail to follow a

systematic pattern and are never statistically significant. The Asian coefficients continue to be


       20
          This pattern is consistent with statistical discrimination in favor of those with
doctorates.

                                                    17
inconsistent with either model of discrimination. In the early and middle rounds, both Hispanics

and older contestants carry positive coefficients. Because of large standard errors, the

coefficients are statistically different than zero only in the middle rounds. These estimates are,

however, substantively quite large: an otherwise average contestant attracts a 30-40 percent

increase in votes by virtue of being Hispanic or old.

        Perhaps the most interesting finding in the paper, once again mirroring the raw data, is the

stark difference in the votes received by Hispanics and the old in the final round. While caution is

warranted given the imprecision of the estimates, it is nonetheless intriguing that Hispanics carry

an economically large coefficient of -.35 in the final round. Although this estimate is not

statistically distinguishable from zero at the .05 level, it is statistically different from the

coefficient on Hispanic in the middle rounds, suggesting a reversal in voting behavior towards

Hispanics over the course of the game. These parameter estimates are consistent with statistical

discrimination towards Hispanics: other players have low expectations about the skill of Hispanic

competitors, even controlling for occupation, age, and performance during the game. In stark

contrast, older players continue to attract excess votes in the final round. The persistent

punishment of older players throughout the course of the game is consistent with a taste-based

model of discrimination. 21

        Table 4 explores the sensitivity of these conclusions to various permutations of the data.

Only the coefficients on the gender, race, and age variables are reported in Table 4. Results are

again shown separately for early, middle, and final rounds. The first column simply reports the


        21
           It certainly does not appear from the results of the head-to-head competition that
competitors have private information about the likely success of Hispanics and old players in the
final round. Hispanics win three of their five head-to-head opportunities, whereas old contestants
are just one for seven in winning the final round.

                                                    18
baseline results presented in columns 2, 4, and 6 of the preceding table. Columns 2 and 3 of Table

4 divide the sample into day time and prime time shows. The same general pattern of results

appears in both sets of shows, although individual coefficient estimates become imprecise,

especially for the prime time show which has fewer observations. Column 4 eliminates

approximately 20 percent of the shows in which explicit collusion may have been present, as

evidenced by blocks of players voting for exactly the same progression of competitors in the

initial rounds of the program. 22 The similarity of voting may, however, simply have arisen by

chance, making this a crude indicator of explicit collusion. There are few systematic differences

relative to the baseline estimates. The final two columns of Table 4 allow the impact of race and

age to vary by gender. The omitted category is White males. The coefficient reported in the

female row corresponds to White females. Imprecise estimates make it difficult to draw strong

inferences, but the results do little to change the basic conclusion that there is little evidence of

discrimination against women, Blacks, or Asians, but potential discrimination against Hispanics

and older players.

        An important consideration in whether one interprets the voting pattern data above as

discriminatory or not, depends on whether these traits (such as Hispanic or old) are indeed

predictive of future performance, conditional on other observable characteristics. Table 5 reports

results relating player attributes to success in answering questions. The first three columns show

results for early, middle, and final rounds respectively. In the last column, the dependent variable

is an indicator corresponding to whether a contestant wins the head-to-head finale, conditional on



        22
          While explicit collusion against minorities is not at odds with either model of
discrimination, the mechanism underlying explicit collusion is very different from that of
individual-level discrimination, so it is useful to try to distinguish the two.

                                                   19
making it that far. All the regressions control for education level and region of residence, as well

as the cumulative percentage of correct answers given up to the current point in the game and that

value squared. In no case is the coefficient on Hispanic statistically significant in Table 5,

although it is negative in three of the four columns. Interestingly, the coefficient for those over age

50 is negative in all four columns, and very large and statistically significant in the last column.

Controlling for other factors, old players do extremely poorly in the head-to-head finale. That

result makes it even more striking that old players are voted off more than expected in the final

round of voting – basic strategy would predict the opposite. Few other coefficients are

statistically significant in this regression, except for past performance, which is highly predictive

of future performance.

        The analysis above, by focusing on overall voting patterns, may overlook discrimination by

particular sub-groups towards other sub-groups. For instance, discrimination by Whites against

Blacks might be disguised if Blacks rarely vote for one another. To examine that hypothesis

further, Table 6 breaks down players into three dichotomous sets of groups by race, gender, and

age.23 The voting patterns within these groups are reported in the table. Rows correspond to the

group casting votes; columns are the group being voted for. The odd columns of the table present

the actual frequency with which votes are cast. The even columns reflect the predicted frequency

under the null hypothesis that votes are cast randomly. Entries on the diagonal, which are of

greatest interest, are boxed in bold.

        The results with respect to race once again show little evidence of discrimination. Non-

Blacks are slightly more likely to vote for Blacks than would be predicted by chance, but this


        23
           Only rarely do Asians and Hispanics have a chance to vote for members of their own
group, so they have been combined with Whites in this analysis.

                                                  20
difference is not statistically significant. Blacks vote for other Blacks somewhat less than would

be expected (.208 vs .242), but again the difference is substantively small and not statistically

significant. There is little evidence of discrimination against Blacks by males or females, the old

or the young.

       There is stronger evidence with respect to gender. Women are about 6 percentage points

more likely to vote for men; men are 3 percentage points more likely to vote for women. In both

cases, one can reject the null hypothesis of no gender bias at or near the .05 level. Because the

contestants are almost equally balanced between men and women, however, the two biases largely

counterbalance one another and there is little aggregate evidence of discrimination. If, however,

the relevant group was dominated by men (e.g. high-ranking managers in many companies), gender

bias of this sort could have an important negative impact on women.

       Finally, with respect to voting against the old, both young and old contestants are more

likely to vote against old competitors. Indeed, old players show an even stronger propensity to

vote against other old contestants, although this coefficient is imprecisely estimated due to the

small number of cases in which old players have the opportunity to face one another.



Section IV: Conclusions

       Using the unique institutional set-up of Weakest Link, this paper tests for the presence and

type of discrimination. Perhaps surprisingly, no evidence of discrimination towards Blacks or

women is found, whereas there is substantively large magnitudes of observed discrimination

towards Hispanics and the elderly. The data are consistent with statistical discrimination toward

Hispanics and taste-based discrimination toward the old. There is also evidence that women tend

to vote more frequently for men and vice-versa. It is important to emphasize, however, that

                                                  21
characteristics such as race, gender, and age do not appear to be the primary determinants of

voting behavior.

       Given the highly stylized nature of the interactions on this television show, one must use

extraordinary caution in trying to draw general conclusions from these results. Indeed, one could

imagine that the absence of observed discrimination towards Blacks in this artificial context might

arise precisely because of the presence of real-world discrimination towards Blacks which has

sensitized Americans to the importance of not appearing outwardly racist, regardless of inward

beliefs. At some conscious or unconscious level, contestants may shy away from targeting Blacks

on a nationally televised program. In contrast, players may be less concerned about appearing to

target Hispanics and the elderly.     Ideally, one would like to isolate real-world settings in

which the strategic incentives flip as they do on Weakest Link to provide a more readily

generalizable test of competing theories of discrimination.

Notes to table 3: The dependent variable in all columns is the number of votes received by a contestant in a given
round. The unit of observation is a contestant-round. Estimation is done with ordinary least squares. Standard
errors, clustered by episode and round, are in parentheses. All regressions include an exhaustive set of
interactions controlling for round*show-length interactions. The even columns include state of residence fixed
effects and occupation dummies, but these coefficients are not reported in the table. Early rounds correspond to
the first two rounds of the prime time show (one hour long) and the first round of the day time show (30 minutes
long). Middle rounds correspond to rounds 3-5 of the prime time show and rounds 2 and 3 of the day time show.
Final round corresponds to round 6 of the prime time show and round 4 of the day time show.

   Notes: The baseline specification in column 1 corresponds to the results reported in columns 2, 4, and 6 of
Table 3. All other columns adopt identical specifications, except for the differences noted. Columns 2 and 3 of
this table divide the sample into prime time and day time shows. Column 4 drops roughly 20 percent of the sample
in which there is a possibility that explicit collusion occurred between some set of the players. Columns 5 and 6
show results allowing the effects of race and age to vary by gender. The omitted category in these regressions is
White males. The coefficient reported for female in column 6 is for White females. Standard errors, clustered by
episode and round, are in parentheses.

Notes: Values in the table are the actual and predicted probabilities that votes cast by contestants of a particular group identified by rows of the table
will be for contestants of the group identified in columns of the table. Predicted probabilities assume that players vote randomly among all eligible
competitors. The values in the table exclude the final round of voting because strategic incentives are reversed in the final round. Standard errors, in
parentheses, are computed under the null hypothesis of random voting. Cases in which all of the remaining competitors are in the target group, or none
of the remaining competitors are in the target group are excluded from the calculations.
