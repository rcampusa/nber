We study the employment and output effects of the short-time work (STW) policy in Germany
between 2009 and 2010. This intervention facilitated reductions in hours worked per employee
with the goal of preventing layoffs. Using confidential German micro-level data we estimate a
search model with heterogeneous multi-worker firms as a basis for policy analysis. Our findings
suggest that STW can prevent increases in unemployment during a recession. However, the
policy leads to a decrease in the allocative efficiency of the labor market, resulting in significant
output losses. These effects arise from a reduction in the vacancy filling rate resulting from the
policy intervention.

             We study the employment and output effects of the short-time work (STW) policy in Germany between
          2009 and 2010. This intervention facilitated reductions in hours worked per employee with the goal of
          preventing layoffs. Using confidential German micro-level data we estimate a search model with heterogeneous
          multi-worker firms as a basis for policy analysis. Our findings suggest that STW can prevent increases in
          unemployment during a recession. However, the policy leads to a decrease in the allocative efficiency of the
          labor market, resulting in significant output losses. These effects arise from a reduction in the vacancy filling
          rate resulting from the policy intervention.


1        Introduction
In 2009 Germany experienced the largest drop in GDP among OECD countries. Figure 1 shows that GDP fell
by 6.9% in the first quarter of 2009 (OECD average -4.8%). As Figure 2 shows, the German unemployment rate
increased by less than one percentage point. This experience stands in sharp contrast to other OECD economies,
where the unemployment rate increased markedly during the recession and in many cases remained high in the
post-crisis period.
        The economic press has largely attributed this ‘German miracle’ to the use of ‘short-time work’ (STW)
or ‘short-time compensation’. In this paper we ask whether STW played an important role in explaining the
distinct response of the German labor market.
        STW describes a policy instrument which aims at mitigating the negative impact of shocks on the labor
market. It enables firms to reduce labor demand via the intensive margin (the number of hours worked per

employee) instead of the extensive margin (the number of employees). Firms that want to temporarily reduce
hours per worker must formally apply for STW. Approval is subject to a strict set of legal requirements.1 Absent
approved use of STW, unilateral reductions in hours worked below the contracted number of hours are not legal.
Workers affected by STW are eligible for a partial compensation of their earnings loss.
       In 2009 the STW instrument was significantly extended. For the remainder of this paper, this extension will
be referred to as the ‘STW policy’. The German government dramatically loosened the eligibility criteria for
firms and significantly expanded the policy’s scope.2 During the recession years of 2009 and 2010 the German
government compensated 60% (67% for workers with children) of the net earnings difference due to a working
hours reduction. Hours worked were paid as usual.3 Newspaper ads were taken out by the government to
   1
       The German Code of Social Law, Book 3 (SGB III) defines short-time work. The requirements for STW are 1.) The hours
reduction must not be preventable, meaning employees must not have accumulated overtime or holidays, and the firm must be
unable to compensate the work stoppage with variations in intra-firm working hours that are permissible according to the work
contract. 2.) At least a third of the firm’s workforce must suffer an earnings loss of at least 10%. 3.) The firm must show that it is
facing a temporary reduction in working time due to an economic downturn. The maximum duration of STW is six months. The
firm must show that after this time full-time employment can be restored. There exist three different forms of short-time work: 1.)
Due to economic distress (§170), 2.) seasonal fluctuations (§175) 3.) transfer payments mainly during the German reunification
(§216b). In this paper we focus exclusively on the first type. The use of other types of STW has not significantly changed during
the period under consideration.
    2
      Eligibility criteria 2) and 3) referred to in footnote 1 were loosened. Most importantly, firms no longer needed to show that
the hours reduction would only last a maximum of six months. The employers’ contribution to social security was initially paid in
full by the firm. In a subsequent modification, the employers’ social security contribution was made proportional to actual hours
worked or even paid in full by the government in special cases.

      During STW, a firm continues to pay an affected worker’s social security contributions in full. These ‘remanence costs’ increase

encourage firms to apply for STW. The maximum duration of STW was extended from six to 18 and later 24
months. At its height the program included around 60,000 establishments and approximately 1.5 million workers
(about 3.5% of the labor force).4 The extension of the policy was reversed in 2010.
   In our analysis, the choice of the labor input is placed in a search context with multi-worker firms, following
Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007), allowing for bargaining between a firm and its workers, as in Elsby and
Michaels (2013). Multi-worker firms are subject to persistent aggregate and idiosyncratic productivity shocks
and choose both employment and hours worked. We use confidential German plant-level micro data on the
universe of German manufacturing plants (the ‘AFiD-Panel Industriebetriebe’) in order to estimate a structural
model of the German labor market. Our quantitative exercise uses a simulated method of moments (SMM)
approach to match the distributions of hours and changes in German firms prior to the policy.
   We use the model to address two questions: (i) can short-time work save jobs? and (ii) what are the costs of
STW in terms of output and productivity? We answer these questions by simulating a counterfactual scenario
to determine the response to the recession without STW. Our results indicate that STW can save jobs. However,
the policy has negative effects on output. From our estimated model, in the absence of STW, the output loss
during the recession would have been 5.3% and unemployment would have risen by about four percentage points.
The German ‘miracle’ would largely disappear.
the hourly wage through over-proportional social security payments.
   4
     In May 2009 there were 1,442,667 workers on STW for economic reasons, up from 39,697 a year earlier. In the Appendix we
give more details about the uptake of the policy over time.

    The key to the effects of the STW is reallocation. Under the policy, productive firms find it more costly to
hire labor as fewer workers are released into the unemployment pool. In market economies the efficiency of the
allocation of factors across production sites has been shown to play an important role for aggregate productivity
(see Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2013), Cooper and Schott (2016)). By
intervening into the reallocation of factors across production sites, i.e. preventing labor from flowing towards
the most productive firms, STW can generate adverse effects on GDP through this ‘reallocation channel’. To
uncover this channel, it is important to take the firm size and productivity distribution into account by explicitly
accounting for firm heterogeneity.
    Our model studies the composition of the labor input in response to the STW policy. Burdett and Wright
(1989) model the choice of hours and employees in a static contracting environment. They establish how the
introduction of unemployment insurance and/or short-time work can influence how the adjustment of labor
input is decomposed into changes in average hours and the number of workers. The use of a search model, as in
our analysis, naturally creates a setting which distinguishes the number of workers from the intensive margin of
hours worked as the former matters for the determination of search frictions.
    Other papers which study the STW policy in Germany during 2009 and 2010 include Burda and Hunt
(2011), Dustmann, Fitzenberger, Schönberg, and Spitz-Oener (2014), Balleer, Gehrke, Lechthaler, and Merkl
(2016), Cahuc and Carcillo (2011), and Hoffmann and Lemieux (2016).5 Burda and Hunt (2011) provide an
overview of the institutional framework in Germany. They conclude that the main reasons for the performance
of the German labor market during the years 2009/10 were a reticence to hire in the previous expansion, wage
moderation, and flexibility in hours worked (mainly through STW but also through working-time accounts).
Balleer et al. (2016) build a search and matching model in which heterogeneous workers can be put on STW. In
their model a persistent STW ‘policy shock’ generates positive output and employment effects because firms can
reduce the working times of unprofitable workers. Our model is different from Balleer et al. (2016) because we
consider heterogeneous firms and homogeneous workers. This allows us to study the productivity implications of
the allocation of workers to firms. Another important difference is that we explicitly allow for an intensive margin
of labor demand, even absent the STW policy.6 In contrast to much of the previous research on the German
labor market (e.g. Krause and Uhlig (2012), and Cahuc and Carcillo (2011)) we highlight the importance of
firm heterogeneity, both in the data and in our model. Representative firm models as in Marimon and Zilibotti
(2000) and Kudoh and Sasaki (2011), as well as reduced-form relationships ignore this heterogeneity and are
therefore unable to capture the effects of STW on labor reallocation and output.
    Competing explanations of the German employment ‘miracle’ during the last recession stress the importance
of the labor market reforms in the early 2000s (the so-called ‘Hartz-reforms’), a reticence to hire in the previous
expansion, and the adoption of working-time accounts (Burda and Hunt (2011)). We do not find these alternative
explanations to be sufficient.
    The 2005 Hartz-reforms were primarily aimed at reducing the generosity of long-term unemployment insur-
ance, thereby increasing the job acceptance probabilities of unemployed workers. These reforms had no direct
   5
     As noted above, this paper is also related to the literature on the efficacy of hours reductions in static firm models (see e.g.
Burdett and Wright (1989), Hunt (1998, 1999), Braun and Brügemann (2014)).
   6
     Selective application of STW to specific workers is largely impossible in Germany due to legal constraints (see e.g. Kruppe and
Scholz (2014)).



                                                                 4
impact on the employers’ flexibility to adjust hours.7
        Further, in our employment data for the universe of German manufacturing firms, we do not see evidence
for a reticence to hire in the period prior to the 2009 recession. Figure 3 shows that that aggregate employment
growth was positive between 2006 and 2008.
        Burda and Hunt (2011) highlight that intensive margin employment adjustments are difficult due to institu-
tional constraints and that firms increasingly took advantage of the flexibility through working-time accounts.8
We test the robustness of our results with respect to firms’ flexibility in hours adjustment absent STW. This
is meant to reflect the growing importance of working-time accounts. Balleer et al. (2016) provide evidence
that during the Great Recession firms did not substitute working time accounts for short-time work. They find
that firms with working time accounts more frequently used short-time work to adjust employment than firms
without working time accounts. Furthermore, working-time accounts typically need to be balanced at the end
of the year.


2        Data
Our micro data comes from the ‘AFiD-Panel Industriebetriebe’, a confidential panel of the universe of German
manufacturing plants administered by the German Federal Statistical Office in cooperation with the statistical
offices of the German Länder. The panel contains annual data from plants with more than 20 employees between
1995 and 2010.9 It covers a maximum of 68,000 plants per year. Participation in the surveys is mandatory. For
the purposes of this paper we use an unbalanced panel of 39,180 plants.10
        Our focus on the manufacturing sector is warranted for the purpose of this paper because the use of STW was
heavily concentrated in that sector. At the height of the STW program in 2009, over 80% of workers and 45%
of plants that used STW were operating in the manufacturing sector and 16.9% of all manufacturing employees
were on STW (see Appendix). In Germany, employment in this sector is heavily concentrated in medium-sized
and/or family-owned firms (German Mittelstand ). Including these firms is therefore crucial in any assessment of
labor market policies. Using administrative micro data drastically reduces sampling bias and allows for a clear
identification of the effect of the policy on employer behavior. A shortcoming of the data is that it contains no
direct information on whether or not a plant used short-time work, in contrast to Niedermayer and Tilly (2016)
and Balleer et al. (2016). Despite the lack of direct information, this section produces ample evidence that the
    7
     Krause and Uhlig (2012) evaluate the impact of those reforms on employment. They find a large reduction in unemployment
due to the reforms but attribute the behavior of the German labor market during the 2009 recession to STW, which they do not
model. Contrary to our approach, the search model in Krause and Uhlig (2012) is in large parts calibrated to the US labor market.
   8
     According to Burda and Hunt (2011) positive balances on working-time accounts have initially allowed firms to lower working
hours without laying-off employees but they do not explain why the unemployment rate remained low even when this first buffer
was fully exhausted. Firms were required to fully balance working-time accounts and reduce accrued holidays before being eligible
for short-time work. In their Table 7, (p. 300) they show that short-time work constituted the single most important source of
changes in hours per worker between 2008/09.
   9
     The data includes smaller plants if they belong to a firm with at least 20 employees. For the years 2007 to 2010 the cutoff to
be included in the survey was increased to 50 employees. In our data this change did not significantly influence the distribution of
our variables of interest, also because many smaller plants continued to provide the information. Furthermore, in the Appendix we
show that the vast majority of workers on STW worked in medium and large firms.
  10
     We start with 59,268 unique plants before winsorizing the data. Plants with less than three consecutive observations account
for 2.8 percent of all plant-year observations and were deleted from the final sample. This leaves on average 39,180 plants per year.
Of those, 19,373 plants were observed for all years between 1995 and 2010.

effect of the policy is visible in our sample.
   Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. The table shows time-series averages of total employment, total
hours, hours per worker, and revenues. The average number of employees is 98.5. More than 50% of plants
employ less than 50 workers, whereas the largest 10% employ more than 220 workers. Average hours worked at
the plant level are computed as total hours worked divided by total employment. The large differences between
the 10th and the 90th percentile of the distribution of revenues illustrate substantial plant heterogeneity. The
2009 recession is clearly visible in our micro data: Between 2008 and 2009 mean (median) revenues fell by 9%
(12%).
   We use the micro data to decompose changes in total hours worked into an intensive and an extensive margin.
Figure 3 shows a large reduction in total hours worked in 2009, with a reversal in 2010. The figure not only
shows that the reduction in total hours was unprecedented, it also reveals that almost 70% of it was driven by
reductions in hours per worker. We attribute this to the use of STW. In previous recessions, for example in
2003, there was no similar extension of the STW instrument and also no comparable decrease in average hours.
   The fact that Kurzarbeit created an unprecedented flexibility in average hours is central to this study. This
flexibility is highlighted in Figure 4, which shows the distribution of changes in average hours. The years 1995-
2008 (blue) serve as references years, while the year 2009 (red) is the year of the STW policy. In 2010 (green)
the policy was phased out. The figure shows the share of plants adjusting hours within a given interval for each
of the three different time periods. We define inactive plants as those who adjust annual hours by less than 5%.
   Three things stand out: 1.) Adjustments in average hours are prevalent, 2.) the hours change distribution
between 1995 and 2008 is characterized by many small adjustments of less than 5% (including inactivity), whereas
large adjustments of over 20% in average hours worked are rare, and 3.) in 2009 the distribution significantly
shifts towards negative hours adjustments. Only looking at aggregates in the number of hours worked per
employee thus hides substantial heterogeneity among plants. The impact of the STW policy is clearly visible in
our data: The fraction of plants that reduced average hours by more than 20% more than tripled in 2009. This
unprecedented shifts reflects the ability of plants to reduce hours worked as a results of the STW policy. These
negative hours adjustments were reversed in 2010, where large positive adjustments are prevalent in the data.

3    Model
In the next sections, we construct and estimate a search model of the labor market. The model is used to
evaluate the effects of STW on the German economy.
    We first describe the stationary economy without any constraints on firms’ hours choices and without ag-
gregate shocks. In the next subsection, we model the German labor market by imposing a lower bar on hours,
below which firms cannot operate, h ≥ h. The STW policy removes this constraint and provides income support
for workers whose hours are reduced.
    The economy is populated by workers, firms, and a government. The time period is one month. Firms are
subject to persistent, time-varying idiosyncratic productivity shocks ε. Firms choose the number of workers n
and average hours h. Workers are homogeneous. The labor market is frictional. There exists a constant returns
to scale matching technology M = m(U, V ), with the unemployment rate U and the vacancy rate V as inputs.
The labor market tightness θ = V /U is a sufficient statistic for the job finding and vacancy filling probabilities.
A vacancy is matched to a worker during a period with probability q = M/V = m( VU , 1). A worker finds a job
with probability φ = qθ.

3.1   Economy without Hours Constraints
This sub-section describes the optimization problem of firms as well as the values of employment and unemploy-
ment for workers. Using these values, a wage function is obtained as the outcome of a bargain between a firm
and multiple workers.

Firms The production technology uses labor as the only input and is given by F (L). Define L ≡ h · n as
total labor input, composed of the number of workers n and average hours h. The production function F (L)
is assumed to be strictly increasing and strictly concave. Hours adjustments are costless and instantaneous.
Adjustments in the number of workers are costly because of the existence of vacancy creation costs.
   The timing is as follows: At the beginning of a period the firm has n−1 workers and learns about its
idiosyncratic productivity state ε. A firm in state (ε, n−1 ) chooses n (equivalently, posts vacancies) and h to
determine its scale of production. The compensation it pays, given its choice of h and n is determined by a
compensation schedule, detailed below. If a firm is hiring (shown by the indicator function                  1+ ), the change
in employment is given by n = n−1 + qv. Taking into account the vacancy filling probability q the firm can
perfectly choose the level of employment n. If a firm is firing then n = n−1 − f . There are no firing costs and

Here cv is a linear vacancy creation cost. The discount factor is β. Worker compensation per hour is ω(·), which
will be derived below.
       The FOC with respect to hours is given by

                                        εFL (h · n) − ω(h, n, ε) − ωh (h, n, ε) · h = 0.                                  (2)

The firm chooses hours to equalize the marginal benefit from increasing total labor input by an additional hour
with the marginal cost: The wage must be paid for one additional hour of work and existing workers have to
be paid an increased wage to compensate for the hours increase. Let H(ε, n) denote the optimal choice of hours
given (ε, n) that solves (2).
       If ∆n 6= 0 the first order condition for n yields

                                                                                cv +

                                                                                q

                        Vn (ε0 , n)dG(ε0 |ε) is the marginal effect of current employment choices on the expected future
                    R
where D(ε, n) ≡
value of the firm. The firm changes employment until the point where the marginal benefit of the employment
change is equal to the expected marginal cost. The marginal benefit of an additional worker is given by the
change in output plus the expected effect on the future value of the firm. The marginal costs include the
additional hiring costs and the changes in wage payments.
       As stated, the model excludes job to job flows. Given the magnitude of these flows in Germany, this
omission from the model is not crucial. Between 1985 and 2010 the average job-to-job transition rates of full-
time employees was 0.5%. Ravenna and Schott (2016) document that the job-to-job transition rates during the
2009 recessions were not significantly different from previous recessions.
       In addition, the model abstracts from firm entry and exit. The moments from the balanced and unbalanced
panels are almost identical, due to the fact that entry and exit rates in manufacturing are very low. There is no
evidence that entry and exit rates changed during the policy years.

Workers Workers’ preferences are defined over consumption and leisure. The disutility from providing hours
is given by ξ(h). We assume that ξ 0 (h) > 0, ξ 00 (h) > 0, and ξ(0) = 0. Workers are assumed to be risk-neutral.
They can be either unemployed or employed.11
       The value of being employed in a firm in state (ε, n) is given by

                         W e (ε, n) = ω(h, ε, n) · h − ξ(h) + βEε0 ,n0 |ε,n sW u + (1 − s)W e (ε0 , n0 )
                                                                                                        

    Both Burdett and Wright (1989) and Cooper et al. (2007) allow for worker risk aversion and emphasize the role of insurance
in labor contracts. Risk sharing is fundamental to their view of wage determination. For this analysis, risk sharing could be
incorporated into the analysis as well but the main point is to highlight the trade-off between intensive and extensive margin
adjustments due to STW.



                                                                9
where h = H(ε, n). An employed worker’s instantaneous utility consists of the hourly wage ω(·) times h hours
worked minus the disutility from providing h hours. A match can be (endogenously) severed with probability
s. In that case the worker becomes unemployed next period and receives the future value of being unemployed,
W u . With the counter-probability the worker remains employed in the firm, which is then in state (ε0 , n0 ). The
expectation is taken over possible future levels ε0 conditional on today’s value of ε.
       The value of being unemployed is given by

                                     W u = b + βEε0 ,n0 |ε,n (1 − φ)W u + φW e (ε0 , n0 ) .
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                               (5)

The instantaneous utility for an unemployed worker is the (exogenous) payoff b. With probability 1 − φ the
worker remains unemployed. With the counter-probability a match is formed with a hiring firm. That firm will
be in state (ε0 , n0 ) tomorrow. The expectation is taken over the distribution of (ε0 , n0 ) among hiring firms.

Wage Setting Because of the labor market frictions, quasi-rents exist from forming a match over which
workers and firms bargain.12 This gives rise to a wage function which depends on the productivity level, as
well as hours and employment choices of the firm. This wage function is obtained through a Nash bargain by a
representative firm and identical workers.
       Since the production technology features decreasing returns to scale, we adopt the bargaining solution first
proposed in Stole and Zwiebel (1996) by extending the framework in Elsby and Michaels (2013) to include hours
worked. The bargain is over wages, taken as given that firms will optimally select hours given the compensation
function, as in (1).13 A worker’s surplus from forming a match is given by the value of being employed in a firm
in state (ε, n) minus the value of being unemployed. The firm’s marginal surplus of forming the match with any
given worker is given by


                             S(ε, n) = εhFL (h · n) − ω(h, n, ε)h − ωn (h, n, ε)hn + βD(ε, n)                                  (6)

with h = H(ε, n).
       Wages are determined after employment, meaning that hiring costs are sunk. The bargaining power of the
worker is parameterized as η. Nash-bargaining over the marginal surplus implies that the surplus is shared
according to
                                                                      η
                                               W e (ε, n) − W u =        S(ε, n).                                              (7)

The wage solves the following differential equation:14

       Wages are increasing in the worker’s bargaining power, the marginal product of labor, the hiring costs, the
value of leisure, and the disutility of labor. The term wn (h, n, ε) · h · n represents the effect of a marginal worker
  12
     As suggested by Dustmann et al. (2014), we consider bargaining between a firm and its workers rather than national bargaining.
  13
     Brügemann, Gautier, and Menzio (2015) argue there is an inconsistency in the framework of Stole and Zwiebel (1996) and
propose an alternative extensive form game to support the Shapley value outcome.

     All the expressions to solve (7) and derive the wage can be found in Appendix B.


                                                                10
on the firm’s marginal product of labor. If the negotiations were to fail, this increases all the other workers’
marginal product of labor, thus increasing the average wage payments for the firm. With respect to Elsby and
Michaels (2013) there is an additional effect from the disutility of providing hours: the optimal choice of hours
influences the effect a marginal worker can have on the marginal product of labor. By choosing higher average
hours, the firm can decrease the marginal product and partially offset the spillover into the remaining workers’
marginal product in case of a failed wage negotiation.

   The optimal employment policy is defined by cutoff values in idiosyncratic productivity ε. If productivity
today is below a certain threshold, the firm will fire workers. Similarly, if ε is above a certain threshold, the firm
will post additional vacancies. The cutoffs define a region of inactivity. The thresholds are denoted as ψv and
ψ. The inverse of the threshold values, ψv−1 (ε) and ψ −1 (ε), define the optimal choice of employment given the
level of productivity ε today. This employment policy will be denoted as N (ε, n−1 ) and takes the form

Distribution of Firms The distribution of firms over productivity and employment is denoted λ(ε, n−1 ). Its
law of motion is governed by the process for idiosyncratic profitability shocks and the firm’s employment policy
function, N (ε, n−1 ).

Equilibrium A stationary equilibrium consists of policy functions N (ε, n−1 ) and H(ε, n), a stationary distri-
bution λ∗ (ε, n−1 ) and a wage schedule ω(·), such that policy functions solve the firm’s problem, the wage solves
the bargaining problem between workers and firms, and the distribution λ∗ is a fixed point.

3.2      Hours Constraint and Short-Time Work
To capture the rigidities of the German labor market in terms of hours adjustments, we let h represent some
notion of ‘normal’ hours per worker, as in Burdett and Wright (1989).15 Firms must set h ≥ h, which introduces
an additional constraint on the firm optimization problem compared to the setup above, where implicitly h = 0.
We can now introduce the ‘STW policy’, which will be represented by the parameter Ξ. Firms that use the
policy must set average hours subject to h ≥ h − Ξ. In this way the policy can have an effect on hours (and
therefore also employment) by increasing Ξ in an environment in which the lower bound on hours is binding.
The policy parameter can take values Ξ ∈ (0, h], with 0 representing ‘no policy’, and Ξ = h representing ‘full
flexibility’.
       In line with the German STW policy, the government replaces a fraction τΞ of the regular full time wage
of workers with h < h. For each worker on STW the government pays τΞ · (h − h) ω(h, ε, n). This is financed
through a lump-sum tax τ on all workers to balance the government’s budget. There is no experience rating
and thus no direct charge to firms for workers being compensated under this scheme.
       The size of the labor force is L. The government’s budget constraint is given by
                                                    Z
                                     L · τ = τΞ ·                 (h − h) · 1h ω(h, ε, n)λ(ds)                                (16)
                                                     s=(ε,n−1 )

The indicator     1h takes the value of one if h > h ≥ h − Ξ. When the policy is not in place τΞ = 0. Since
the policy is financed in a lump-sum fashion, taxes do not affect the negotiation because they do not change a
worker’s surplus from finding a match. The value of employment becomes

           W e (ε, n) = ω(h, ε, n) · h + τΞ · (h − h) ω(h, ε, n) − ξ(h) − τ + βEε0 |ε sW u + (1 − s)W e (ε0 , n0 ) .
                                                                                                                 

    Below, we show the robustness of our results with respect to h due to additional flexibility in hours (working-time accounts as
stressed by Burda and Hunt (2011)) or contractual arrangements (Dustmann et al. (2014).



                                                                   12

This defines H(ε, n; Ξ). The employment function characterized above is not changed by the policy.
         Importantly, the wage function specified in (8) is assumed not to respond to the use of STW by a firm.
That is, workers in firms using STW work fewer hours and receive a wage according to (8), but we prevent the
firm from appropriating part of the workers’ surplus that comes from the government subsidy. We justify this
assumption both on the grounds of empirical relevance and its quantitative implications.
         In our model, if wages were renegotiated after accounting for the subsidy to workers, firms would capture
a fraction of the government subsidy and be induced to increase employment.16 Using STW to reduce hours
and increase employment in this manner is contrary to both the stated intent of the policy and evidence of firm
behavior during the use of STW.17


4         Calibration and Estimation
This section presents our parameter values. The model is fit to the economy prior to the policy intervention and
is then used to explore the effects of STW.

4.1        Parameterization
The stationary model is fit to the German economy prior to the 2009 recession. There is an hours constraint
h > 0 but no STW policy, i.e. Ξ = 0. The model is solved at a monthly frequency. The discount factor is set at
β = 0.9967, corresponding to an annual interest rate of 4%.
         The top block of Table 2 indicates the calibrated parameters. The matching function is assumed to be of
the form M = µU γ V 1−γ . We set the match elasticity to γ = 0.65 as in Kohlbrecher, Merkl, and Nordmeier
(2016). We target the German monthly job-finding probability of φ = 0.0622 as reported in Ravenna and Schott
(2016). The German Employment Agency publishes a monthly series of the number of vacancies. We find an
average labor market tightness of θ = 0.091. This implies that in the steady state µ = 0.1439. The resulting
monthly vacancy-filling probability is q = 0.6835. The parameter α, which governs the decreasing returns to
scale in production, is taken from Cooper et al. (2007) and set to 0.65.18 Workers’ disutility of labor is given by
               1+ ξ1
ξ(h) = ξ0 h        1   .
         The parameters b, ξ0 , and η are jointly calibrated by targeting average employment, average hours worked,
and the labor share. From the German micro data we obtain a target for the average establishment size of
     This leads to the existence of a second local maximum in the firm’s objective function, one where h < h, and another for
    16

h ≥ h. Because the subsidy τΞ is large (60 - 67%), this has the quantitative implication that all firms end up using STW, while
simultaneously expanding their number of employees. The most closely related paper studying the use of STW in Germany, Balleer
et al. (2016), circumvents this problem by having single-worker firms.

     Our data does not allow us to estimate the parameter α directly from the German plant-level data. The estimates in Bachmann
and Bayer (2014) for a cross-section of German non-financial firms implies a value of α = 0.7.

98.5 workers. As in Cooper et al. (2007) we normalize hours such that in the steady state without time-varying
ε, average hours are equal to one. We calibrate η by targeting the labor share in manufacturing in Germany
between 1995-2008, which is 0.76. The flow value of unemployment b amounts to 13.8% of average monthly
wages.
    The remaining parameters are estimated via simulated method of moments (SMM). These parameters are the
vacancy-posting costs cv , the disutility of labor ξ1 , and the parameters governing the evolution of idiosyncratic
productivity shocks, ρε and σε . There exists no one-to-one mapping of parameters into moments here. We
therefore choose moments that are informative about the underlying parameters. The estimated parameter
values are shown in Table 2. The estimation is summarized in Table 3.

    A key consistency requirement is that the stock and flow concepts of unemployment consistently yield an
unemployment rate of 9.04%, the average unemployment rate in Germany between 1992 and 2009, the same
period that was used to compute labor market tightness.19 The jointly estimated parameters must ensure that
this consistency requirement is met.
    The hours change distribution is informative about the parameter ξ1 . It influences how firms adjust hours
  19
     The law of motion for unemployment implies that u∗ = φ+δ

given by firms’ employment policy, pinning down total employment N , which is L(1 − u∗ ).


                                                               14
following a change in ε. We target the fraction of firms with small hours adjustments.20 This inactivity rate is
equal to 53.8%. Similarly, we identify cv via the fraction of employment inactivity (47.6%). Another moment
                                     cv(n)
we include in the estimation is      cv(h) ,   the ratio of the cross-sectional coefficients of variation of employment and
hours. This moment is informative about the relative importance of the hours and employment margins in the
economy’s steady state.
       The estimation finds the vector of parameters Θ = (cv , ξ1 , ρε , σε ) that minimizes the (weighted) distance
between moments calculated from the model and the data. This distance is denoted as L(Θ).

4.2      Moments
The estimated parameters generate simulated moments that lie close to their empirical counterparts, as Table 3
shows. The size of the vacancy posting costs cv implies that firms spend on average 1.2% of monthly profits on
vacancy posting costs.21 The estimated values of ρε and σε , as well as the steady state job destruction rate lie
close to parameter values estimated in related studies.22
       The model generates an inactivity rate in hours of 54.2% and an hours change distribution which is very
close to the data. The model’s employment change distribution is characterized by a large inactivity region of
48.5%, which is slightly above its empirical counterpart.23 While the model produces a realistic employment
change distribution, the absence of a richer structure of employment adjustment costs implies that the model
produces too many large adjustments and too few small adjustments compared to the data.
       An important object in determining the model’s dynamics is the negotiated hourly wage between workers
and firms. This is shown in Figure 5. The hourly wage is decreasing in the total number of employees n and the
number of hours h. If n increases for a given h, this decreases the marginal product of labor and thus negatively
affects the wage. When changing hours there are two effects at work. First, similarly to the case for changes
in n, for a given n an increase in h decreases the marginal product of labor. This negatively affects the wage.
However, the wage now also takes the worker’s disutility for providing hours into account. As hours increase,
this disutility effect becomes increasingly stronger.
       More productive firms are larger. The model also generates a positive relationship between the intensive
and extensive margins of employment, workers and average hours. Large firms choose longer hours for their
workers. The reason behind this has to do with labor hoarding: the presence of labor adjustment costs generates
inactivity in the firm’s employment policy. Facing the possibility of receiving a low idiosyncratic productivity
shock, a large firm might find it optimal to be able to reduce total hours worked (n · h) through a reduction in
hours. This positive relationship between n and h generates a positive relationship between firm size and hourly
wages.
  20
     As in the data we define ‘inactivity’ as adjustments smaller than 5% in absolute value. To correspond to our data equivalent,
we use time-aggregation to compute year-to-year changes.
  21
     Cooper et al. (2007) find that total monthly adjustment costs are 0.775% of firm profits. Silva and Toledo (2009) find that the
labor costs of posting vacancies are 32.66% of the average monthly worker wage. In our model this figure is 39.18%.
  22
     For example, we obtain a job destruction rate δ = 0.0062, which is very close to the value of 0.00605 obtained by Ravenna and
Schott (2016) using German worker-level data. The estimated baseline values in Bachmann and Bayer (2014) imply monthly values
of ρε = .99725 and σε = 0.0261.

5    Policy Implications and Aggregate Shocks
We now add two exogenous aggregate states to the model. The first one is an aggregate productivity shock
A. The second one is the STW policy. There are two levels of aggregate productivity, Alow and Ahigh . In a
recession, i.e. when A = Alow , the STW policy can be active or not. The state when STW is active during a
recession is denoted as AΞ . The three aggregate states are therefore {Ahigh , Alow , AΞ }. We assume that STW is
always unexpected by firms.24 The joint transition matrix Π of the aggregate state between periods t and t + 1
is given by

                                                                 Ahigh   Alow   AΞ
                                                                                     
                                                     Ahigh         ρ     1−ρ    0

    The probability of a change in the productivity state absent STW is given by ρ. Once the economy is in
the STW-recession state AΞ , the policy will continue with probability π. The probability of entering the high
productivity state is not affected by the STW policy. The probability π is chosen to generate an expected
  24
     As a robustness exercise we compute results when the policy is not unexpected in Section 6. The results are qualitatively
unchanged.




                                                                   16
duration of STW of six months.25 We calibrate ρ to generate an average duration of a recession and expansion
of three years.
      With shocks to aggregate productivity A the vacancy-filling probability is no longer time-invariant. Firms
need to forecast the vacancy-filling probability q, which is an equilibrium object determined by λ(ε, n−1 ), the
joint distribution of firms’ productivity and employment levels. To solve the model with aggregate variation
we employ a computational strategy along the lines of Krusell and Smith (1998). To forecast q 0 firms use the
information about current q and the current and expected aggregate productivity levels. The outcome of this
iterative procedure is a forecasting equation used by firms given by

                              log(q 0 ) = β0 + β1 log(q) + β2 A + β3 A0 + β4 (A = A0 ) + ν.

The estimated coefficients when Ahigh = 1, Alow = 0.99, and ρ = .0904 are β0 = 1.13, β1 = 0.62, β2 = 2.32, β3 =
−3.59, and β4 = 0.01. The resulting R2 = 0.9991 and the maximum accumulated forecast error is 0.15%. The
fact that firm policy functions are characterized by a region of inactivity facilitates the estimation of the forecast
equation. For a given q, shocks to aggregate productivity generate shifts in the firms’ inactivity regions. The
vacancy-filling probability q is a slow-moving state variable because of the persistent idiosyncratic shocks, which
generate a staggered adjustment process of labor demand. How many firms have adjusted labor demand is
reflected in the aggregate statistic q. Therefore current q is an important variable in forecasting q 0 . We then
solve the firm’s and worker’s optimization problem with the transition matrix Π and the forecast law of motion
for q 0 supplementing the idiosyncratic shocks, i.e. the firm’s state becomes s = (ε, n−1 ; A, q).

5.1     STW without Aggregate Productivity Shocks
We are ultimately interested in assessing the effectiveness of the German STW policy during the recent recession.
To begin, we consider the effects of STW without variations in aggregate productivity. This allows us to isolate
the effect of the policy and later study potential interactions with aggregate productivity.
      A key implication of the constraint is that if a firm cannot choose h < h after receiving a negative shock
to idiosyncratic productivity, it will make additional adjustments in labor demand via the extensive margin.
The STW policy gives the firm additional flexibility in hours. This flexibility implies fewer layoffs and a lower
unemployment rate. Because of its effect on the vacancy-filling rate, the lower unemployment rate leads to higher
search costs for expanding firms that wish to hire new workers. This misallocation will produce a negative effect
on output.
      The direct effect of the policy is to eliminate the floor on hours. Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution
of average hours worked with and without STW. Without the constraint a significant fraction of firms chooses
h < h. Absent the policy, firms create an hours buffer in order to be able to respond to variations in ε without
having to resort to firing.
      Next, we show a simulation of the transition from an economy with a binding hours floor to one where
STW is in place. This is represented by the blue, solid lines in Figure 7. This case is labeled ‘GE’ for ‘general
equilibrium’, because the vacancy-filling probability q endogenously responds to changes in firms’ policies. Figure
 25
   This corresponds to π = .8706. The maximum duration of STW was six months before the 2009 episode. During 2009 the
maximum duration was increased to 24 months.

7 shows that under the STW policy employment increases by 2.5% (the unemployment rate falls to 75% of the
steady state unemployment rate without STW). Average hours worked decline by 4.5%, leading total hours
worked to decrease. The vacancy-filling probability decreases by 4.3 percentage points, implying an increase
in vacancy-creation costs of 6.65%. This leads to less hiring by expanding firms, causing the observed drop in
output of 1.05%.
      The endogeneity of q is crucial for the negative effect on output. The red, dashed lines in Figure 7
show the results for the transition into an economy with STW when q is exogenously fixed at its steady-steady
value. This is abbreviated as ‘PE’, for ‘partial equilibrium’. The positive employment response is now more than
twice as large. Importantly, when firms do not face higher vacancy-creation costs as a result of the policy, total
output is virtually unaffected.26 In partial equilibrium, the policy increases employment without the negative
consequences for output.
      To reinforce this point, consider the effects of the policy on average hours and employment growth for
 26
      Additional negative effects on total hours worked (n · h) come from the increase in wages.

different types of firms. We group firms into four bins, based on their idiosyncratic productivity and lagged
employment level in relation to the respective median. We focus attention on two groups here: Firms with low
ε and high n and firms with high ε and low n. Figure 8 compares the responses of average hours worked and
average employment for these groups at the time the STW policy becomes active. The left (right) side shows the
response for firms with low (high) ε and high (low) employment. The top (bottom) panel shows the response of
average hours (employment). As before, the solid blue line shows the results in general equilibrium, while the
red dashed line shows the partial equilibrium responses, when q is held constant.
   The figure shows the heterogeneous response of firms. Firms with low ε and high n will tend to shrink.
These are the firms that are actively using the STW policy. When the policy is not in place, the hours floor is
binding for these firms. After the introduction of STW, they reduce average hours worked to a level below h and
employ more workers because there are fewer layoffs. The responses are qualitatively similar under exogenous

or endogenous q. When q responds to the STW policy and hiring costs increase, retaining more workers inside
the firm becomes more attractive and the positive employment effects are larger.
   Contrast this with the behavior of firms with high ε and low n. These firms tend to grow and are therefore
generally not using the STW policy. Here the differences between the exogenous and endogenous q cases stand out
clearly. While under exogenous q growing firms shift total labor demand towards slightly fewer average hours
and more employment as a result of the additional flexibility, the opposite is the case when q endogenously
                                                                                                   cv
responds. In that case, because of the increase in vacancy creation costs                           q ,   growing firms hire fewer workers
and instead work their existing workers longer hours.
   The STW policy creates additional flexibility at the firm-level by making it possible for firms to overcome
the hours variation friction. This exerts positive productivity effects because firms set hours such that the
static first-order-condition (10) always holds. On the other hand the policy leads to less employment growth
in expanding firms. Because more labor is being retained at unproductive shrinking firms, expanding firms

                                                                     20
are faced with a higher vacancy creation cost. This leads to less employment growth in firms with positive
productivity growth, which negatively affects output. As Figure 7 shows, the joint effect of these two forces is
that employment increases but output falls.

              The solid blue (dashed red) lines show a recession without (with) STW in place. All values with the
              exception of the fraction of firms using STW (last panel) have been normalized to their pre-shock
              values.



   We now show how the STW policy interacts with negative productivity shocks. We set Alow = AΞ < 1 to
generate two recession states, one with, and one without the policy. Figure 9 shows two sets of impulse response
functions. Starting in Ahigh the solid blue (red dashed) line shows the response of an economy experiencing a
one-time productivity shock Alow (AΞ ). Following the negative productivity shock, firms demand less labor, as
shown by the decrease in total labor input. The composition of this reduction is very different across the two
recessions. Absent the policy, the hours floor is binding and only small reductions in average hours are feasible.
Consequently, the number of employees falls and the unemployment rate rises.
   When the policy is in place, firms reduce average hours by much more while retaining a larger fraction of


                                                              21
their employees. The result is that under the policy, the unemployment rate increases by 0.5%, compared to an
increase of 4% without the policy. As the top right panel of Figure 9 shows, the decline in output is stronger
when the policy is in place. During the STW policy, output falls by an additional 1.6% of pre-recession output.
   This is a ‘cleansing’ effect of recessions, brought about by the endogenous vacancy filling rate. Inflows into
unemployment lead to an increase in q. This incentivizes job creation and is the reason why recessions can
lead to labor reallocation that can ultimately be productivity-enhancing. With the STW policy the ‘cleansing’
channel is muted. As shown above, this implies that growing firms hire less labor. In recessions without the
policy, the correlation of plant-level productivity and employment increases, while with the STW policy the
correlation declines (see Figure 10). Every time a firm decides to hold on to a worker instead of releasing him
or her into the pool of unemployed, the firm inadvertently decreases the vacancy-filling probability for all other
firms. The individual firm does not take this externality into account when making its optimal employment
decision.

Figure 11, where we show average labor productivity per worker and per hour. The effect of the policy is a
relative decrease in ALP per worker, while ALP per hour increases. Because of the reduction in average hours
worked, labor productivity per worker falls by more when the policy is in place. However, because of decreasing
returns, the "marginal hour" of work now produces more output, causing labor productivity per hour to increase.

   On the aggregate level, the STW policy decreases both job destruction and job creation, as we show in
Figure 12. The recession without STW leads to a large spike in job destruction. Employment falls mainly
due to inflows into unemployment. Job creation declines on impact but then overshoots. The reason for the
overshooting is that after the initial employment adjustment it becomes cheaper for firms to create jobs because
the vacancy-filling probability q rises.
   The STW policy can prevent an increase in job destruction during a recession. But because fewer workers
are released into the pool of the unemployed, the vacancy-filling probability increases by less, dampening the
incentives for job creation.

6     Discussion
In this section we discuss the robustness of our results and take the model’s conclusion to the data.

6.1   Robustness
We provide some robustness results of the key effects of the STW policy with respect to parameter changes. We
summarize the effects of the STW policy on employment and output in DN and DY . They give the maximum
absolute difference of employment and output during a recession with or without the STW policy in place.
For variable x we let S (S Ξ ) be the series of observations following the negative productivity shock. Then
Dx = max |S − S Ξ |. To evaluate the elasticities that follow, in our benchmark model the employment difference
is DN = 0.37% and the output difference is DY = −1.61%.
    We start by examining the importance of the models’ parameters for the size of the employment and output
differences. We show the elasticities of DN and DY with respect to parameter changes in Table 4. These


                                                           24
elasticities are informative about which parameters are important in driving the key channels in our model.
They are computed by changing a parameter and then letting the economy converge to its new steady state
without aggregate productivity shocks.27 We then add aggregate shocks to compute impulse response functions
and obtain the employment and output differences following a recession with or without STW.

                                                  Table 4: Elasticities of Dx
                 The table shows the elasticities of Dx with respect to changes in model parameters. Dx = max |S −
                 S Ξ |, where x is respectively employment (N) and output (Y). S and S Ξ denote the series of N
                 observations following a recession with (without) STW.



       Table 4 shows that the parameters b, η, cv , and σ have relatively small effects on the size of the employment
and output differences between STW and a normal recession. For example, a 1% increase in workers’ bargaining
power η leads to a 0.36% smaller DN and a 3.06% smaller DY relative to the benchmark. As workers appropriate
a larger fraction of the match surplus, the firms react less to changes in aggregate conditions. The same intuition
applies to increases in b, which raise workers’ outside option. Small changes in σ do not affect most firms’ regions
of inactivity, therefore leading to small effects on the main channels of the model. The parameter ρε denotes
the persistence of idiosyncratic shocks and generates the largest elasticities of DN and DY . An increase in
ρε leads to larger regions of inactivity and more inaction in firms’ hours and employment policy functions.
A recession therefore leads to smaller employment and output adjustments and the STW policy becomes less
effective. The parameters governing the workers’ disutility of labor, ξ0 and ξ1 are key determinants of the hourly
wage equation (8). Increase in ξ0 and ξ1 increases the hourly wage and change the trade-off between hours and
employment. For example, increasing ξ1 incentivizes firms to grow by expanding the workforce, rather than
using overtime. Similarly, during a recession, firms tend to decrease labor demand through hours reductions,
which become more feasible during STW, increasing DN relative to the baseline. Because fewer of the changes
in labor demand come from changes in the number of employees, the effect on q is limited and the output effects
of the policy are smaller.
       Next, we show the robustness of our results under alternative specifications of the policy. Table 5 summarizes
our findings. The first row shows the benchmark model. In Row 2 we study the impact of the lower bound for
hours. If h < 1, firms can reduce hours below 1 even in the absence of STW, giving them additional flexibly
compared to the benchmark model. This is in the spirit of the working time accounts emphasized in Burda
and Hunt (2011). To show the sensitivity of our results we consider h = 0.975.28 While the results remain
qualitatively unchanged, fewer firms now use the policy during a recession. As a result the relative reduction in
  27
     Clearly, there exist substantial non-linearities in the elasticities of DN and DY with respect to parameters. We compute the
elasticities after a 1% change in the respective parameters.
  28
     We re-calibrate and re-estimate the model, including the law of motion for q.

the unemployment rate is smaller compared to the benchmark model, and the output loss due to the ‘reallocation
channel’ shrinks.

                 series of N observations following a recession with (without) STW.



       In the baseline model, the introduction of STW is always unexpected by firms. Row 3 of Table 5 shows results
for the case when this assumption is removed. In this version of the model firms attach a positive probability
to the introduction of the STW policy in a recession through an additional aggregate state. In a recession, the
economy can transition into a new state Alow,Ξ , in which the STW policy is not active, but can be reached
with positive probability.29 A transition from Alow to Alow,Ξ leads to a small increase in employment and total
hours worked because the probability of being affected by the binding hours floor in the future is now smaller.
The results in Table 5 compare the effects of a normal recession with those from a direct transition into STW.
Compared to the benchmark case the positive employment effects are smaller and the negative output effects
are larger.
       Given that a downside of the STW policy is the adverse effect on hiring, a natural alternative to the STW
policy could be hiring credits. Results are shown in the last row of Table 5. Instead of preventing job destruction,
this policy incentivizes job creation through a subsidy κ for each new vacancy that is created, lowering hiring
costs to (1 − κ)cv .30 We solve the model for κ = 0.25. Our results show that the hiring credits’ potential to
mitigate the increase in unemployment during a recession is limited. Because a large number of firms enter the
labor adjustment region following the negative productivity shock, the unemployment rate spikes on impact. The
hiring credits hardly affect this behavior because they have virtually no effect on shrinking firms. Firms that are
hiring during the recession benefit from the hiring credits and increase their level of employment. This leads to a
faster return to pre-recession levels of unemployment compared to a recession without the hiring credits policy,
but no change in the initial increase. Hiring credits increase the correlation between firm-level employment and
productivity. More labor is flowing to the firms with the highest productivity growth, generating positive output
effects.31 In ‘sclerotic’ labor markets, where hiring and firing is less prevalent than in more dynamic economies,
  29
     In this scenario there are four possible aggregate states, {Ahigh , Alow , Alow,Ξ , AΞ }. The aggregate transition matrix takes the
following form:
                                                         Ahigh      Alow           Alow,Ξ     AΞ

      The tax revenue needed to finance this policy are cv · κ times the number of vacancies created.
  31
      The effectiveness of hiring credits is limited, even when κ is set to a higher level. The reason is that the increase in the vacancy-
filling probability q at the beginning of a recession is decreasing in κ. This has the effect of offsetting the reduction in hiring costs


                                                                     26
the effectiveness of incentivizing job creation is limited.

6.2    Welfare Implications
We use our model to assess the welfare implications of STW. While the STW policy increases employment
relative to a recession without STW, it also lowers total output, making the overall welfare effects ambiguous
ex-ante.
    We distinguish between welfare effects for firms and workers. We subdivide firms into four groups according
to their employment (high/low) and productivity levels (high/low), relative to the median. Employed workers
are grouped in a similar fashion, depending on their employer, while unemployed workers are homogeneous.
    In a recession with STW the value of currently unemployed workers is affected in two ways relative to a
recession without STW. First, because an increase in unemployment is prevented, the job-finding probability
φ = qθ falls by less than during a recession without STW. However, the policy is financed through a lump-
sum tax τ on all workers in the labor force, including the unemployed. In our calibrated model the costs of
the policy (see Equation (16)) amount to 1.4% of current output. For the unemployed, this negative effect on
welfare outweighs the effect of the higher job-finding rate. However, the effects are small, welfare of the current
unemployed changes by -0.026% of its value during an expansion.
    Workers benefit from the STW policy because it reduces the probability of being fired. Additionally, the
disutility from working falls. However, as for the unemployed, the costs of the policy are shared equally while
some workers do not work in firms that use STW. Table 6 shows the welfare effects for four different types
of workers, grouped by the type of firm they are working for. Workers in firms with low productivity ε are
benefiting the most from the policy, because those firms are most likely to put workers on STW. For workers
in high productivity firms the benefits of the policy are noticeably smaller. For workers in firms that have the
most growth potential (low n, high ε), the costs outweigh the benefits.

    We also computed the relative worker welfare gains from STW by whether or not their matched firm used
the STW policy. Workers in STW firms have an average welfare increase of 0.0631% of pre-recession welfare,
while their counterparts see a decrease by -0.0027%.
    A similar picture emerges for firm values, as we show in Table 7. The firms benefiting the most from the
policy are those that have high employment and low productivity. As shown above, those are precisely the firms
that use the STW policy. Firms that do not use the policy still benefit, because of the additional flexibility. But
their value increases by less because of the changes in the vacancy-filling probability q.

6.3     Implications of the Model
This final section contains two exercises. The first one tests the model’s prediction of lower aggregate job
creation following the use of STW. The second one evaluates a counter-factual to study German output growth
and unemployment in the absence of the STW policy.

6.3.1    Job Creation in Germany

The macro data on job creation and job destruction supports the model prediction of lower aggregate job creation
following the use of STW. Because our micro data only contains firms in the manufacturing sector, generating
a ‘control group’ of firms that did not use the STW policy is not possible. We can, however, compare the
manufacturing sector, in which the uptake of the policy was primarily located, to other sectors, in particular the
service sector, where the use of STW was much less prevalent. We use aggregated micro data of worker flows
from the German Federal Employment Agency made available by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB)
as reported in Ravenna and Schott (2016).32
    We group firms into three sectors (manufacturing, services, and others) and obtain the stocks of total em-
ployment and the flows of newly created jobs by sector between 1976 and 2014. The data are seasonally adjusted,
quarterly averages of monthly flows. Our empirical strategy consists of testing for a significant difference in job
creation in manufacturing compared to other sectors during the ‘STW policy’ period.
    We estimate the following model:

                        JCjt = β0 + β1 · STWt + β2 · Manuj + β3 · Manuj · STWt + γX + εjt .                                    (19)

Job creation in sector j at time t depends on a vector of controls X, the STW policy, which is a dummy variable
that takes the value of one between the second quarter of 2009 and the last quarter of 2010, a dummy for the
manufacturing sector, and an interaction term between the policy dummy and the manufacturing dummy. The
coefficient of interest is β3 , which estimates the difference in job creation in manufacturing and other sectors
  32
     Publicly available aggregate data on job creation, job destruction, and total employment by sector is available from the German
Employment Agency. Our empirical results are robust to using this alternative data source (results are available upon request) but
because that data is annual and only available starting in 2004 we gave priority to the IAB data.

(sector-specific) time trend. Results are shown in Table 8.
       The dependent variable is either the logarithm of job creation or the job creation rate. The coefficient of
interest, β3 , is negative and significant in all specifications. The results suggest that job creation (rates) in
manufacturing were significantly negatively affected by the STW policy.33
       While these results do not in themselves provide conclusive evidence of our theoretical channel, they are in
line with our predictions and with findings by related studies (e.g. Balleer et al. (2016)).

6.3.2      GDP growth and unemployment

Recall that Figure 9 shows the model’s predictions of a recession with and without the STW policy. It is
informative to relate these predictions of the model to the actual experience in Germany and other OECD
countries. Based upon model calculations, in the absence of the policy, the decline in GDP would have been
5.3% and the unemployment rate would have been about four percentage points higher. These predictions are
much closer to the OECD average.
  33
    We found our results to be qualitatively robust to various alternative specifications. These include adding 2011 to the ‘STW
policy’ years, removing the residual sector category, estimating the effect in a panel starting in 1995 (after much of the transition
dynamics associated with the reunification had played out), and including previous incidences of widely-used STW programs (1991-
1993) in the STW dummy. Results are available upon request.

7    Conclusion
This paper studies the employment and productivity effects of short-time work in Germany between 2009 and
2010. The policy facilitates reductions in hours worked per employee with the goal of preventing layoffs. Using
confidential German micro-level data we estimate a search model with heterogeneous multi-worker firms. Our
findings suggest that STW was successful in preventing an increase in unemployment. However, the policy leads
to a decrease in the allocative efficiency of the German labor market resulting in significant output losses. This
reflects a reduction in the equilibrium value of the vacancy filling rate induced by the policy intervention. The
aggregate data on job creation confirms the importance of this channel.

nificant share of activity lies in manufacturing or mining. Only plants within Germany are registered. The
underlying data is collected on a monthly basis and then aggregated by year. The employment change distribu-
tion is shown in Figure 13.

Macro Data The remaining graphs show aggregate data on the use of STW in Germany during the period
under consideration in this study. The data comes from the German Federal Employment Agency.34 Figure 14
shows the number of workers and firms using STW for economic reasons.35
       Figure 15 shows the distribution of hours reductions for workers using all types of STW. The vast majority of
working time reductions during the 2009 recession were between 0% and 50%. Figure 16 shows the distribution
of firm sizes for workers using all types of STW. It shows that most workers who were put on STW were working
  34
     It should be noted that the statistics regarding the use of short-time work come from a more comprehensive data source starting
in January 2009. We refer to the Federal Employment Agency’s website for details.
  35
     As was pointed out in the main text, we concentrate on the use of STW due to economic distress (§170). This decomposition in
the aggregate numbers is available since 2008. The overwhelming majority of STW use is due to economic distress. Data for other
uses of STW is available upon request.

in medium and large firms.
   Figure 17 shows the importance of manufacturing for the uptake of the STW policy. The graph is drawn
by averaging over all observations from 2009. More than 80% of workers (or 78% of full-time equivalents) who
were on STW during 2009 worked in manufacturing. Manufacturing firms represented around 45% of all firms
who used STW in 2009. The numbers refer to STW for economic reasons.

B        The Wage
Note from the firm’s envelope condition that the firm’s marginal surplus has a recursive structure. It can be
written as

  S(ε, n) = εhFL (h · n) − ω(h, n, ε)h − ωn (h, n, ε)hn +
                                                                                            Z   ∞                       Z    ψv (n)
                                                                                                     cv
                                                                                        β               dG(ε0 |ε) + β                 S(ε0 , n)dG(ε0 |ε) (20)
                                                                                            ψv (n)   q                      ψ(n)


       Next, we find an expression for the left-hand side of equation (7). The value of a worker who is unemployed
at the beginning of the period is given by
                                            "                                                                            #

                                                                       Z
                               u                            u0                                                  0

                                                                        0       ψ(n)    1 − G(ψv (n))

Upon finding a job today, which occurs with probability φ, the new job must be in a firm that is posting
vacancies. This implies that ε > ψv (n−1 ) today, and that n = ψv−1 (ε). The value of ε0 is unknown, the worker is
taking the expectation over it.36 Under Nash sharing(7) the worker’s expected surplus in an expanding firm is
                                                 η
W e (ε0 , ψv−1 (ε0 ))dG(ε0 |ε) − W u0 =                  0   −1
                                                1−η Vn (ε , ψv (ε)).          From the first order condition of a hiring firm (3) we know
that S(ε0 , ψv−1 (ε0 )) =      cv

       A worker in a firm in state (ε, n) receives an instantaneous compensation ω(h, ε, n) per hour worked and
suffers the utility cost. If the firm receives ε0 < ψ(n) next period, it will fire workers. In that case workers
are selected to be fired at random, so with endogenous probability s̃ the worker will be unemployed, receiving
W u0 . With the counter-probability (1 − s̃) he remains employed in a firm that will be in state (ε0 , ψ −1 (ε0 )).
                                                                           η
Nash-sharing implies that W e (ε0 , ψ −1 (ε0 )) − W u0 =                           0   −1 0

that    S(ε0 , ψ −1 (ε0 ))   = 0, implying       W u0   =   W e (ε0 , ψ −1 (ε0 )). If the firm            hires workers next period, employment

    Moreover, there is a distribution of employment levels, H(n), over which an unemployed worker will take expectations when
evaluating the expected future benefits of being hired (over the employment levels of all hiring firms today).



                                                                               37

if the firm remains inactive, the expected value of an employed worker in the following period will be given by
                                                                            η

   Now we subtract W u from both sides in (26). On the right-hand side we use the expression for W u that was
derived in (23).
