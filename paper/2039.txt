             Seniority Rules and the Gains from Union Organization




                                   ABSTRACT



This paper examines the optimality of several seniority provisions which

are common to U.S. union contracts. The paper focuses on the attempts by

the initial union members to maximize their return from organizing the

union. An overlapping generations model is used in the analysis. Seniority

wage increases are found to serve as implicit initiation fees and thus

serve as one means of appropriating rents from future union members. Lay-

off rules are shown to be optimal only when the organizers are constrained

in the types of contracts they can write. Without these constraints, the

optimal contract provides full insurance making layoff rules unnecessary.

The paper concludes with a plausible set of constraints which organizers

may   face   and discusses the conditions necessary for seniority layoff

rules to result.

 I.   Introduction

      The focus of recent work on unions has switched from the individual union

worker to the bargaining pair consisting of the union and the firm. The most

prominent feature of the bargaining pair is the explicit contract they

negotiate. A careful analysis of the structure of these contracts should aid

our understanding of unions. Recent work in this area includes research on

COLA provisions (Card, 1983; Ehrenberg, Danziger, and San, 1983) and on

contract length (Dye, 1980; Harris and Holmstrom, 1983).

      The aim of this paper is to extend the work in this area in two

dimensions. First, I summarize existing information on the provisions of

major U.S. industrial union contracts (other than COLA clauses and contract

lengths). Secondly, I develop a simple contracting model and discuss the

optimality of these observed contract provisions. The unique aspect of this

model is its emphasis on the initial union organizers rather than the current

union members.

      The organization of the paper is as follows. Section two presents the

summary of characteristics of U.S. union contracts. A simple contracting

model is developed in section three for an environment of no uncertainty.

Section four adds in demand uncertainty and analyzes the structure of the

optimal contract when the firm is risk neutral.

II. Characteristics of U.S. Union Contracts

     In the following sections I will use a contract model to attempt to

explain three general features of U.S. industrial union contracts. These

features are: seniority based wage structures, seniority based layoffs, and

the apparent use of non-price mechanisms to ration union memberships.

     Union wage structures are typically written into the contract in the form

of a wage matrix. The rows of the matrix consist of different job categories

or labor grades while the columns consist of steps within a category or grade.

An example taken from the 1915 contract between Martin Marietta Aerospace and

the Autoworkers is provided in Table 1. Movement between the first and last

step occurred automatically every 14 weeks in 5 intervals.

     Automatic step-wise movements across the columns of the wage matrix are

quite common. The 1978 survey of major collective bargaining agreements by

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that "automatic" increases (i.e.

within rate ranges at fixed intervals without reference to merit) appeared in

65 percent of their agreements covering 59.6 percent of workers (Bulletin no.

2065).

     Medoff and Abraham (1981, p. 5) provide further evidence on this point

based on a survey they carried out:

            virtually none of the very large within-grade or within-job
     earnings advantage associated with company service could be explained in
     terms of productivity; once employees are assigned to grades or jobs, the
     salary advantage that accrue with company service appears to be automatic
     and hence, independent of performance."
     Seniority   also plays an important   role   in movements between job

categories as well. A review by the BLS of approxmately 1,800 major
                                         —3-.




contracts in 1971 (Bulletin no. 1425—11) found that seniority was the "sole"

or "primary" determinant of promotions in 37.9 percent of all agreements

covering 23.4 percent of all workers. In manufacturing, the figure was 40.6

percent of all agreements covering 25 percent of all workers. The Bureau of

National Affairs (BNA) investigated this issue in 1983 by surveying a sample

of 400 contracts from their file of major union contracts. They found

seniority to be the "sole" or "determining" factor in promotions in 45 percent

of the total sample and 54 percent of the manufacturing contracts.

       Even in contracts where seniority is not the "sole" or "primary"

determinant of promotions, it may still be a significant factor. For example,

the 1968 agreement between Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation and the

Steelworkers (U.S.A.) stipulates that:

       "In all cases of promotion, the following factors will be considered:
       (a) length of service, and (b) ability to perform work. In determining
       factor (b), an employee with longer Continuous service shall not be
       compelled to show that he has the highest rating in this factor, it will
       be sufficient for him to show that he has an average rating . . ."
In   general, then, industrial union wage structures can be characterized as

favouring wage increases that are strongly tied to seniority. This occurs

both through movements between job steps and promotions among job categories.

       A second interesting feature of industrial union contracts is how the

union restricts the manner in which the firm can adjust the total labor input

during a downturn. Contracts often place limitations on work-sharing and

stipulate that layoffs and recalls be based on seniority. Work-sharing refers

to hours restrictions, division of work, and rotation of layoffs.

Work-sharing provisions range from outright prohibitions against any use of

work-sharing to restrictions on the magnitude and duration of its use.

     The contract signed in 1973 between the Square 0. Co. and the Electrical

Workers (IBEW) contained the following prohibition:

     "If work becomes slack, the company shall not reduce the work-week for
     the plant to less than 40 hours, but shall make layoffs with occupational
     group and overall seniority . .   so as to maintain a 40 hour week and
     provide employment to those with the greatest seniority."

An example of restrictions placed on work—sharing is provided in the 1971

contract between the Carrier Corp. and the Sheet Metal Workers:

     "For temporary reductions -in production not exceeding 4 weeks in any one
     year, the normal work-week for a work group, department, plant or all
     plants may be reduced to four 8-hour days without involving a seniority
     layoff."

     The overall result is that labor input adjustments in unionized firms

occurs primarily through variations in employment rather than average hours.

Medoff (1979) provides a comparison based on May Current Population Survey

micro data for the period, 1973-1975. He found that layoffs were 45 percent

more -important than reductions in average hours for unionized blue collar

workers but that layoffs were 9 percent less important for non-union blue

collar workers.

    When layoffs occur, union contracts often specify that they take place

according to seniority. The 1971 review of contracts by the BLS (Bulletin no.

1425-13) found that 25 percent of agreements stated that layoffs must be based

solely on seniority. For example, the 1971 contract between the I/A Market's

Food Handler's Division and the Meat Cutters (MCBW) states:
                                      —5.-




     "Seniority will apply to layoffs and rehires. The last employee hired
     shall be the first laid off, and the last laid off shall be the first
     rehired."

     Approximately 44 percent of the contracts with layoff provisions assign

seniority a "predominant" role but allow for considerations of other factors

such as ability. The 1971 contract between Crown Cork and Seal Co. and the

Steelworkers (U.S.A.) illustrates this type of provision:

     "Seniority shall govern in regard to . . . increases or decreases in
     forces, provided that the individual has the ability to perform the job."

The more recent survey by the BNA found that seniority is the "sole" or

"determining" factor in 88 percent of their sample of contracts and 91 percent

of the manufacturing contracts. A common characteristic, then, of industrial

union contracts is that they encourage layoffs over work-sharing and the

layoffs that occur are tied to seniority.

     The final characteristic that I would like to discuss is the apparent

absence of rationing of scarce union jobs by a pricing scheme. Becker (1959)

noted that the ability of unions to generate rents for their members will

create an excess supply of workers for union jobs. This excess supply must be

rationed by either price or non-price mechanisms. Becker argued that it would

appear to be in the interest of the current union members to use a price

mechanism such as initiation fees. However, the typical union initiation fee

is very small in comparison to the present value of the estimated wage

differentials (see Becker, 1959; Taft, 1946). This has led researchers to

examine non-price rationing schemes such as discrimination and queuing (see
                                         -6-


Becker, 1959; Abowd and Farber, 1982).

     In the remaining sections of the paper, I will describe the optimal

contract for the union organizers to write.    I will demonstrate how it may

contain the seniority characteristics discussed in this section. In addition,

I will point out how this contract uses a price mechanism other than

initiation fees to ration union jobs.


III. Certainty Case

     My aim is to investigate the impact of unionization per Se. For this

reason, I start from a set of simplifying assumptions which imply that

seniority should be irrelevant in the non-union sector.   I then analyze what

forms of seniority will be optimal for the organizers of the union to include

in their first contract. This pinpoints which forms of seniority arise

explicitly within a union setting.

     Assume that production takes place with an equal number of young and old

workers. Each type of worker has the same productivity and value of leisure.

There are no fixed hiring costs, no training opportunities, and no problems

detecting shirking. Non-union firm pay a constant wage, WA to young and old

workers. In addition, each worker has the same time separable utility

function with identical discount rates. Young workers may save but they can

not borrow against future earnings. The only distinction between workers is

their remaining number of working periods.

     By organizing a union, the workers are given the right to collectively
                                       —7-


bargain with the firm. As part of this bargaining process, they may jointly

withhold their labor input through calling a strike. It is useful to think of

this bargaining process as involving two distinct components. The first

Consists of an external bargaining between the union as a whole and the firm

over a share of the rents accruing to the bargaining pair. This bargaining

over rents may involve a strike and the ultimate sharing will depend on

reiativ bargaining strengths of the two sides (see Tracy, 1984). This phase

of the bargaining process is not explicitly modelled in this paper.

     Given the outcome of this rent sharing, a second phase of internal

bargaining commences over the distribution of the union's share of the rents

among its members. The analysis begins at this stage of the bargaining. The

first case I consider is where the union organizers can commit the union to a

long-term contract covering the entire future of the union.

     The objective of the initial union members is to structure this explicit

long—term contract so as to maximize their return from establishing the union.

Two conditions imposed from outside the model as well as two conditions

generated from within the model constrain the options open to the organizers.

I explicitly prohibit the union from being able to borrow against its future

flow of rents. That is, the union can only realize its return by collecting

period by period its share of rents in the form of wages. Secondly, union

members are assumed not to have property rights in the union. This implies

that a member's union card has no asset value and consequently can not be sold

when he leaves the union.' Finally, the two internal constraints on the
                                           -8-



organizers are that they cannot write a contract which violates in any period

the initial rent—sharing agreement with the firm. In addition, the contract

terms must be structured so that the union can attract new members and retain

old members in each subsequent period.2

     To summarize, initial union members incur some cost in order to organize

a union. In return for this investment, these workers gain two things. The

first is that the firm pays the union a share of the rents accruing to the

bargaining pair each period. Secondly, these workers are given the right to

draw up an explicit long-term contract and to commit the union to that

contract. The case where the contract is open to renegotiation in each period

will be discussed later on in this section. Throughout the analysis, the

demand conditions (both present and future) facing the firm are assumed to be

known with certainty by both the firm and the union.

     In order to explicitly describe the organizer's decision problem, define

the following:

                 = Wage paid to young union workers in period t

                 = Wage paid to old union workers in period t

          WA = Wage paid to non-union workers

          K = Firm'sshare       of total rents

          N = Number of workers in the union which is equally
              divided among young and old members.

         R(N) =    Total   revenues net of non-labor costs

With no uncertainty, contracts simply stipulate the wage to be paid to young

and old workers in each period. Denote a particular long—term contract by
                                               -9-



w =           where   W =   (wt,wt).
      There is no consensus in the literature on the appropriate objective

function for a union. For simplicity, assume that the organizer's objective

function is given by the weighted average of the utility of a young and an old

organizer. The specific weight used, A, is determined by the relative

bargaining strengths of the young and old organizers. The decision problem

for the organizers during this second phase of bargaining can be written as:


(1)        MAX A [U(w1) +            U(w02)] + (1—A) U(w01)
                              (1p)

                                                                           (1)'   ,tt

(10)        w0t: (1+p) U(w0tbfti =        t    -     t   3




       The structure of the optimal long-term contract is summarized in the

following two propositions.


       Proposition 1:

            The optimal contract distributes all of the union's period by period

       share of rents to its members. In addition, only the initial organizers

       benefit from the union.


       Demonstration

            Given that X > 0, equation (5) implies that      > 0. Similarly,

       with X > 0, equation (8) implies that 712 > 0. Since 112 > 0, equation (7)

       implies y2 > 0. Setting t = 3 in equation (10), 2 > 0 implies that 713

       > 0. Finally setting t = 3 in equation (9), 713 > 0 implies that 13 > 0.

       Repeated use of equations (9) and (10) shows that     > 0 and ' > 0 for

       t   3. Combining this result with the earlier results give us that n.t > 0
       Vt while    > 0 for t     2. The rent constraint is binding f or each period

       while the lifetime utility constraint is binding for all new members who

       join the union in periods following its establishment.


       If the union organizers could charge entry fees and if no capital market

imperfections existed, then it would not be surprising to find that
                                            —11—


proposition one holds. That is, despite the fact that the firm pays the union

a share of rents in each period of the contract only the organizers benefit

from being in the union. The entry fee would be set equal to the discounted

value of this flow of rents. This would allow the organizers to fully

appropriate all future rents. What makes proposition one interesting is that

it holds even when the organizers can't use explicit entry fees. Given this

constraint, the organizers adopt a second-best method of price rationing. The

nature of this alternative scheme for appropriating future rents is given in

proposition two.


     Proposition 2:

               The optimal contract involves seniority based wage increases. That

     is, the union wage profile is steeper than the non-union profile for all

    members who join the union after -it is established.


     Demonstration

               Assume for simplicity that the magnitude of X is such that both

    young and old organizers benefit from setting up the union, i.e.

           =      = 0.   The optimal contract is given by


           =
               (w1,w01)
      t
           =   (w*,w*); t
                 yo          2



    These wages are implicitly defined by the following conditions


     (i)
                                                    —12—


            U'(w*
                yl               (i-A)
(11)                     =
            U(w*
               01
                  )                A



(12)        R(N) =           (w*1÷w*1) = K


       (ii) (w,w):

(13)               {W: U(W) + (•i÷p) U (W) = U, R(N) - (w+w)               = K}



(14)        w* = MAX w
             0        0
                   w*cw
                             $


            The opt-imality of               is clear since it exhausts the total rents
       available to the organizers in the first period and divides these rents
       in the appropriate manner given the relative bargaining strengths. To

       show that W* = 1t=2                   optimal, we must demonstrate two things.
       First we must show that W dominates all other feasible stationary
       contracts. Secondly, we must show that no non-stationary contract can

       be optimal.
            Consider any stationary contract from period two onwards:
       W=             where              = (w,w) ; t    2. Proposition one demonstrated
       that a binding rent and life—time utility constraint are necessary
       conditions for an optimal contract. Given a stationary contract, this
       implies that W satisfies

       Consequently, for a stationary contract W to be optimal, WeW5. Which

       stationary contract out of the set W will the organizers prefer? The

       only wage term in these contracts that enters the organizer's objective

       function is we,. This wage is collected by the young organizers during

       their second period in the union. This implies that the organizers will

       choose the stationary contract from W which has the largest value for

       w0. This is summarized in equation (14).

            We will now demonstrate that there is no non-stationary

       contract that can dominate W* and satisfy the two necessary conditions

       from proposition one. Consider any non-stationary contract (w)2.

       In order to dominate W*, the non-stationary contract must set w2 >            w.
       Again this follows from the fact that w02 is the only contract term in

       {w)2 which enters the organizer's objective function. If w02 >

       then in order for W2 to satisfy the second period rent constraint, w2 <
            The contract {w}'2 must also be able to attract young workers in the
       w.
       second period. Since w,2 <              this implies that w03 >
                                           w                             w.   The magnitude

       of w   is illustrated in Diagram One.
           03
            The optimal stationary contract sets W equal to Point A in the

                                                              the non-stationary contract
       diagram. Suppose that by increasing w02 >          w
       sets w2 equal to Point B. To satisfy the lifetime utility constraint for

       new members in the second-period, wages paid to these new members when
                                            —14-


     they are old must be equal to the level indicated by Point C. Given that

     the non-stationary contract must also satisfy the rent constraint in

     period three, W3 is set to equal to Point D. Continuing with the

     argument indicates that the non—stationary contract must raise wO, and

     lower           each period from their previous levels in such a way

     as to move up along the rent constraint. This strategy can not be

     continued indefinitely given the upper bound of           [R(N)-K] for w0

     and the lower bound of zero for               Thus, no non—stationary contract

     can dominate W* and simultaneously satisfy the rent and lifetime utility

     constraints in each period. The optimal contract, then, is stationary

     from period two onwards. The proposition is demonstrated by noting that

     W <   w       < p4*
      y        A      o


     When commitment is possible, the union organizers find it optimal to

write seniority-based wage increases into the contract starting in the second

period. Tilting the wage profile in this manner transfers income from new

union members to the organizers. However, this form of price rationing

creates an inefficiency in the intertemporal consumption pattern of new

members. This inefficiency limits the magnitude of the wage tilt. In

addition, this explains why new union members are indifferent between joining

the union or not despite the fact that the firm is continuing to share the

rents in each period.

    An interesting comparative static result comes out of this simple model.

Consider the impact of a reduction in the union's flow of rents. This shifts

the bargaining constraint inward. Following the argument above, the optimal

stationary contract moves from Point A in the diagram to a point southeast

along the indifference curve U. This implies that the wage/tenure profile

will be flatter than before. If empirical measures for the total rents

available to a bargaining pair and for the union's relative bargaining power

were available, then the model predicts that these two variables would

interact positively with tenure in a union wage regression.

       The remaining aspect of the certainty case to discuss is the structure of

union contracts when the union can not commit itself to future contract

provisions. In this case, the contract can be changed each period. While it

seems natural to assume that current young union members are uncertain about

their future relative bargaining strength, I limit myself to the case

where the sequence of bargaining strengths is known in advance. Let this

sequence be denoted by h =
                             {X}'1.    The optimal contract conditional on h

that is signed in period t is given by W I A and consists only of a young and

old wage for that period.

       For any t, W A solves:


(17)                 [Uyt +     (1+p) U(w+1)] + (1—At) U(w0t)

       Rather than discuss the general structure of these contracts, I will

focus on two special cases involving specific A sequences. The first case is

Where the only young workers to have any bargaining power are those that help

organize the union. That is, A = 0 for t2.


       Proposition 3:

             The optimal long-term contract with commitment is identical to the

       sequence of one-period contracts where no commitment is possible but

       for t2.


       Demonst rat ion


            Substituting for At in equation (22) we get that 1J(w0t) =

       Since U(wt)>O and         this implies that >0. That is, the rent

       sharing constraint is binding for t2. Now substitute        into equation

       (21) to get that )'tU(wt)=         Since U(Wyt)>O and i>O, this implies
                                        —17—


     that          The lifetime utility constraint is also binding for t)2.

     These two constraints plus the feasibility constraint for older workers

     define a stationary sequence of one-period contracts identical to the

     long-term contract discussed in proposition two.


     The optimal long-term contract can be supported even though commitment to

future contract terms is impossible if         for t2. How might we rationalize

this particular sequence of relative bargaining strengths? Suppose that all

proposed changes in the contract terms must be voted on by the current union

members. Given the simple age structure and preferences of the union members,

there are only three possible voting outcomes: unanimous opposition,

unanimous support, or a split vote along age lines. The sequence            for t2
would result if all ties were broken in favor of the old union members.

Instead of commiting the union to a long—term contract, the union organizers

only need to commit the union to this voting rule. This may be possible

through adopting a union constitution which embodies this rule and which

requires more than a majority vote to amend.

     The second case to consider is where the relative bargaining strength of

young workers is constant through time. That is,       = A > 0 for all t.



     Proposition 4:

            When At = A for all t, union organizers can use seniority-based wage

     increases to extract rents from future members only when older union

     workers have relatively more bargaining strength, i.e. A <   1/2.
                                      -18-


     Demonstration:

           Assume that both old and young union organizers earn some rents from

     the union. This implies that A > 0 and     =    = 0.   The first-period

     wages, then, satisfy the following two conditions:

           U(w* )
               yl ——(1—A)
           U(w*01)     A


           R(N) —
                      (w+w)   = K



     These wages define a stationary contract which satisfies the first-order

     conditions for each subsequent period. When A <   1/2, w1 < w1.

     To summarize, if the union organizers can commit the union to a long-term

contract, then they will structure the contract so that wages increase with

seniority. Making the wage profile steeper than the productivity profile

allows the organizers to appropriate some of the rents that the firm pays out

to future union members. Seniority-based wage increases act as a substitute

for initiation fees.4 Commitment t a long-term contract is not necessary so

long as the organizers can commit the union to a voting rule which sets At = 0

for t2. When the organizers can not commit the union either to a long-term

contract or to the appropriate voting rule, then their ability to appropriate

future rents is limited by the relative bargaining strength of future union

members.

     One final point to note in the certainty case concerns the impact of the

political nature of unions on the contracts they write. A union contract can
                                      —19-


not go into effect until it is "ratified" by the union membership.

Differences between union and non-union practices have been viewed as arising

from differences in preferences between a "median" union voter and a

"marginal" non-union worker. Freeman (1976) explains:

          "If as a first approximation the median voter model is applied
     to union behavior, trade union policy will be set by the median
     member (who is the marginal voter) . . . trade unionism transforms
     the supply side of the job market by making median (or some other
     average) rather than marginal preferences the 'determinant' of the
     labor contract." (author's emphasis.)

     This model offers two cases where this distinction does not apply. If

the organizers can commit the union to a long-term contract or if no

commitment is possible but At = 0 for t2, then the optimal contract is given

by point A in diagram one. Given the bargaining constraint, the s"tructure of

this stationary contract is determined entirely by the preferences of the

"marginal" worker deciding whether to join the union or not. So long as the

constraint on hiring new union members is binding (i.e. new union members do

not earn rents), "marginal" rather than "median" preferences will play a key

role in shaping the form of the contract.


IV. Uncertainty Case

     In this section the optimality of different layoff "rules" is examined

when the firm faces demand shocks in each period. In order to generate

layoffs in the model, a very simple form of uncertainty is used. In each

period, the firm is in either a "high" or "low" state of demand. The

probability of a high demand state occurring in any period is P and is
                                         -20-


independent of previous demand conditions. In low demand states, I assume

that it is efficient for the firm and the union to lay off a fraction e of the

union workers where 0 < e <   1/2.   That is, it is possible to concentrate all

layoffs in one cohort of workers. If a worker is laid off, then he either

finds a part-time job paying WA or receives b in terms of leisure and state

unemployment benefits. There are no search costs and the probability of

finding a part-time job is given by 6.     1 assume that b and 6 are the same for

young and old union workers in order to minimize the need for layoff rules in

the non-union sector.

     Throughout this section, I assume either that the union organizers can

commit the union to a long-term contract or to the appropriate voting rule

supporting a long-term contract. The first point that I would like to

establish is that the union organizers incorporate layoff rules into the

contract only as a means of overcoming restrictions on the types of

compensation they can write into the contract. This observation is

illustrated through the following two propositions.


    Proposition 5:

          If the organizers are prohibited from paying y wages to laid

    off workers, then so long as the probability of finding a part—time

    job is not too high, the organizers adopt a seniority layoff rule.


    Demonstration:

    Let    index the layoff rule in the tth period. As        ranges from

    zero to one, layoffs occur by strict inverse seniority to strict
                                                          —21—


seniority. Intermediate values a correspond to randomized layoff

 rules. Contracts Consist of four wage terms for each period plus

the layoff rule,               =                                           Superscript      e denotes

a wage paid to an employed worker in the bad state. The organizer's

decision problem can be summarized as follows.5

       Given that the organizers want to tilt the wage profile in order to

       appropriate rents, w <           <                Clearly, U(we) > EIJ'.   If 8 is

       by Holmstrom (1983), it is too expensive ex ante to lay off the older

       workers who receive higher wages. The organizers adopt a strict

       seniority layoff rule, i.e.          =       1.   The difference between this result

       and Holmstrom's is in the motivation for the tilted wage profile.


       Now consider how the optimal contract changes when the organizers face no

restrictions on the types of compensation they can use in the contract. In

particular, the contract can pay unemployment wages to young and old workers,

these wages can be conditioned on whether the laid off worker finds a

part-time job, and these wages can be negative for young workers so long as

they still have an incentive to remain in the union.
                                                    -23-


Proposition 6:

       If the union organizers can structure unemployment wages as outlined

above, then they are indifferent to the manner in which the firm

initiates the layoffs.


Demonstration

       Add a second superscript to index whether a laid off worker finds

a part-time job or not. This creates eight wages for each period, i.e.

   =                                      i =   y,o.      The decision problem for the

organizers can be written as in proposition 5 where now6

The first-order conditions for W imply that it is optimal for the

organizers to structure the contract so that each cohort of workers is

fully insured across all demand and employment states.

Substituting in for these insurance results causes                           to drop out of both

the objective function and each of the constraints. Consequently, the
                                       -24—


organizers are Indifferent to the layoff rules used.


       The need for layoff rules, then, arises from restrictions on the set of

feasible contracts available to the organizers. The results of proposition

five provide a reasonable explanation for union seniority layoff rules only to

the extent that the restrictions placed on the contracting environment also

seem reasonable. Previous work on implicit contracts (see: Akerlof and

Miyazaki (1980) and Rosen (1983)) has pointed out that there is little

theoretical justification for a priori prohibitions against payments made to

laid off workers by their firms. In addition, these payments are actually

written into U.S. union contracts. A survey by the BLS (Bulletin no. 2065)

found that 25 percent of manufacturing contracts examined provided

"supplemental unemployment" benefits. These contracts covered 53 percent of

unionized manufacturing workers. In addition, Feeman and Medoff (1984) found

that unionized firms have a 5 percent higher probability of offering

supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and an 81 percent higher

expenditure on these benefits.


       In light of this evidence, it is important to examine the use of layoff

rules in a setting where the union organizers are given more latitude than

allowed in proposition five. Specifically, I allow the contract to specify

wages to unemployed workers. These wages can vary depending on the workers

age cohort. However, the bargaining pair can not verify whether or not a laid

off   worker secures a part-time job. This implies that unemployment wages can
                                                    -25-


not be indexed to the worker's subsequent employment status. This provides an

intermediate case to those discussed in propositions five and six.


     Proposition 7:

         Given the set of feasible contracts described above, the specific

     layoff rule which is optimal for the organizers to write into the

    contract depends on their attitudes toward risk. The optimal rule is

    given by

    Seniority layoffs                                              increasing

     Seniority layoff rules may be part of an optimal explicit contract even

when limited forms of supplemental unemployment benefits are allowed.

However, even this restriction on the set of feasible contracts may also be too

strong. The basic assumption used is that the state can verify the worker's

subsequent employment status while the union (or firm) can not. This

informational asymmetry may not exist in practice. For example, the SUB plan

adopted for Ford Motor Company and the UAW in the early sixties deducted any

outside earnings over $10 per week from the total benefit. (See: BLS

Bulletin no. 1425-2).

    Two final issues are worth discussing. The first concerns the

"enforceability" of the contract. This issue has been raised by several

authors recently (see for example Bull, 1983). The fact that union workers

can not be forced to fulfill a particular contract has been allowed for by the

inclusion of the to utility constraints. However, there still remains the

issue of what prevents the firm from firing older workers who are being paid
                                      -28-


wages in excess of their productivity. The standard argument is that

"reputation" effects are strong enough to rule out this type of behavior (see:

Holmstrom, 1981, 1983). In the context of union contracts, collective action

by the union may provide a stron9er deterrent than reputation effects.

Formalized union grievance procedures may be interpreted as a type of

enforcement mechanism. This illustrates another example of the "Exit vs.

Voice" distinction between non-union and union labor markets (see: Hirscham,

1970).
     Finally, I would like to address a potential criticism of the model. A

central feature of the model is the desire by the union organizers to increase

the tilt of the union wage/tenure profile as a means of appropriating rents

from future members. However, most empirical studies (see: Block & Kuskin,

1978; and Duncan & Leigh, 1980, 1985) find that union wage/tenure profiles are

flatter than non-union profiles. These findings may still be consistent with

the model's predictions. It is important to interpret the wage rate in the

model as the total compensation for a period. The above studies ignore

non—wage components of the compensation package. Freeman and Medoff (1984)

find that for a union and non-union job paying the same wage, fringe benefits

are approximately 30 percent higher for the union job. In addition, they find

that unions alter the composition of the fringe benefits in a way that benefits

older workers. They conclude:

         "We find that, while wages do not rise as rapidly with age or
    seniority for union workers as for non-union workers, nonwage
    benefits rise more rapidly with age under unionism, and by more than
    enough to offset the slower increase in wages with age." (p. 131)
                                      —29--



     Total compensation/tenure profiles may in fact be steeper for unions as

suggested by this model. However, a remaining criticism is that Freeman and

Medoff's evidence also indicates that both young and old union workers receive

higher levels of total compensation than their nonunion counterparts. This

does not substantiate the model's prediction that young union members should

not earn rents from being in the union.

1.   This is in contrast to the taxi cab market where medallions do have asset

value. See Martin (1980) for a discussion of these property right issues.


2.   There may arise circumstances in which the union is both willing and able

to drive the firm out of business by bargaining for more than the total amount

of the rents.   I restrict my attention to cases in which the firm has

sufficient bargaining power to insure itself a share of the rents into the

indefinite future. This implies that it is always important that the union is

able to attract new members.


3.   An alternative may to see that point A in the diagram is the optimal

stationary contract is to notice that the other possible stationarycontract

is not feasible since it sets w <          In addition, it is important to note
                                     WA.

that A only affects the distribution of the union's first-period rents among

the young and old organizers. The shape of the wage/tenure profile from

period two on is independent of A.


4.   An additional rationale for unions to tilt their wage profile exists in

states with right-to-work laws. These laws allow workers to choose to be

covered by a union contract without joining the union. A free-rider problem is

created since initiation fees can be collected only from those workers who join

the union. This can in part be circumvented if unions implicitly collect the

initation fee through a tilted wage profile.


5.   Implicitly I've assumed that workers accumulate seniority while on

layoff. In a survey of contracts, the BLS (Bulletin no. 1425-14) found

considerable variation in the actual treatment of seniority on layoff. Many
 contracts allow workers to collect seniority for the entire layoff period

 regardless of its length. Some contracts specify a maximum possible layoff

 period for which seniority accumulates. An example of this is given by the

contract signed between Dunlop Tire and Rubber Company and the United Rubber

Workers in June 1973:

     "A laid off employee subject to recall with 2 years' or more of
     seniority when laid off shall be carried on the seniority list
     indefinitely. If rehired, he shall receive credit for seniority
     held at time of lay—off, plus seniority credit for time laid off not
     to exceed 2 years."

The BLS, though, also found examples of contracts in which no seniority was

collected on layoff.


6.   I've assumed here that the firm pays for unemployment wages out of

current revenues. This type of "unfunded" plan is actually not used much in

practice. Out of a total of 174 supplemental unemployment benefit (SUB) plans

examined by the BLS in the early sixties, only three were unfunded. The

common practice is for a single employer or group of employers to pay each

period a fixed amount per employee into a fund. All SUB payments are paid out

of this fund. This type of financing was used in 160 out of the 174 plans

examined. So long as you require that the firm's per period contributions

equal its expected SUB payments, then the results carry through. A third type

of financing is an individual worker account. According to this method, the

firm keeps track of all credits and payments made for each employee. Unlike

the funded plans, these accounts are vested in that employees can take any

surplus in their account (up to some maximum amount) with them when they leave

the firm. This third form of financing was found in 11 of the 174 plans (see:

BLS Bulleting no. 1425—2).
