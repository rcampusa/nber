                                 ABSTRACT




         Previous  studies of female labor force participation in
Japan   often   show that the estimates of female wage rates are
 negative" in their single—equation models of labor supply.
Based on the common belief that the substitution effect dominates
the income effect for female labor supply, to disentangle the
problem of the inconsistency is, therefore, necessary for the
purpose of predicting the behavior of female labor supply and for
guiding policy actions.
         Xn this paper, we have estimated a logit model of married

women's part—time employment and a fertility equation in the context

of a simultaneous-equation model. By specifically differentiating
part-time   employed married women from full-time employed married women,
we find that the structural coefficients of the part-time labor
supply are significantly different from those of the full-time
labor   supply in terms of elasticity. However, contrary to the
result of married women's full-time employment, we find little

interdependency between married women's decisions to work as

part—time employees and their fertility in urban Japan.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1981, the number of married women with spouse present

(hereafter, married women) was about 29.8 million, L9.Lt    percent
of which were in labor force.1 About 8 million of the married
women in the labor force were employed in non-agricultural and
forestry industries and 29 percent of them were part—time
             2
employees.
       In Japan, women generally give priority to housework after

marriage. They stay in (or enter) the labor     market   only as long as
their jobs do not conflict with their housework, e.g., preparing

meals, cleaning house, and raising children. Married women who
re—enter the labor market at a later date often work at firms of
relatively small size and/or become part-time employees at low
                                                                   3
wages in the seniority dominant lifetime employment structure.

The greatest increase in part-time employment for married women
has been witnessed in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade
and the service industries. They tend to enter and leave with the
business cycle because of the types of the industries where they
are employed and partly because of their primary responsibility

in the household.
                                   2




       Previous studies of female labor force participation in
Japan often show that the estimates of female wage rates are

"negative" in their single-equation models of labor supply

(Hill 1982). In recent years, however, female labor supply has
been successfully analyzed by Hill (1982, 1983, and 1984) and
Yamada and Yarnada (1984). Hill constructs a logit model which
explains the behavior of female labor supply for both grouped
and disaggregated data well. Hill finds that the ratio of female
employees to the total number of females over age 15 is a suitable

measure for the female labor force participation rate in Japan.5
Subsequently, Yamada and Yarnada (1984) estimated a simultaneous-

equation model of married women's labor supply and fertility in
urban Japan and found a significant interaction between the two.

However, these previous studies have not fully analyzed the labor
supply of part-time employed married women because Hill (1982 and

1984) treats full—time and part—time employees together while
Yamada and Yarnada (1984) studies only full-time employed married
women. Therefore, there exists little empirical evidence of
the factors influencing the behavior of part-time employed

married women in Japan.6
       There are several reasons why we consider it equally

valuable to study the labor supply of part-time employed married

women as well as their full—time counterparts.
                                                                         4
                                  3




       First, their employment has grown in secondary and tertiary
industries in past years. Wholesale, retail and services in tertiary
industry are likely to grow further as the economy grows in the future
Secondly, because of the reduction of the young labor force, ages 15

through 19, employers hire married women as part-time employees not
only as the main substitute to make up the reduction, but also as

the labor force against cyclical contraction of the economy.
The employers adjust the number of part-time employees as well as

their hours of work in response to peak hours and peak seasons of
business. This reflects the fact that the firms usually incur low
quasi—fixed costs for married women1s part-time employment due to

less fringe benefits, less specific job trainings, and their wage
scale which is excluded from the seniority system. Thirdly,
the historical increase in womens life expectancy and the rapid

decrease in marital fertility permit a longer span of potential
working years for married women Fourthly, the main motivation for
married women to enter the labor market is to supplement the household
income. Their financial contribution to the household has become

increasingly important in the past several years: their average
                                                             7
monthly earnings are nearly 11 percent of their husbandts.

This factor seems to be more important in influencing the decision

to work as future part-time employees. Finally, 3i44 percent of
women not in the labor market wished to have held a job in 1979.

45.1 percent of the potential labor force wanted to be part—time

employees while 12.2 percent wanted to be full-time,8 These
observations indicate that we can no longer ignore part-time
employed married women in the labor market.

       The present paper focuses on married women's part-time
labor supply and fertility in urban Japan in a simultaneous-

equation model, The increasing number of married women's part-time
employment and the falling marital fertility rate can be treated
as endogenous variables subject to the household decisions in
the "new home economics" (Schultz 1974). Although one might
argue that the reasons for married women's decisions to work as
a part-time employee would differ from the reasons of full-time

employed married women (Luft 1975), we rather consider that their

decisions to become part—time employees in Japan is subject to
the similar socioeconomic constraints as the full—time employed
married women on the basis of the reasons stated earlier and

according to Takahashi (1983) and Japan (Labor White Paper 1983).
       Our model, which uses corss-sectional market averages,

has several advantages. These advantages are fully discussed in
Cain and Dooley (1976), Link and Settle (1981), and Yaniada and

Yamada (l98L), however, we will only point out a few remarks here,

First, distinguishing married women from all females, and also
                                  5




urban Japan from all Japan, will yield a relatively homogeneous
group of married women. Secondly, variations in tastes and transitory
wages within a given geographical area can be averaged out.
Thirdly, our estimates will circumvent a simultaneous equation

bias by explicitly treating both married women's part-time labor
supply and fertility as endogenous variables in the model.

Finally, our estimates will permit comparisons with the estimates
obtained with Japanese data (Hill 1984, and Yarnada and Yamada

1984) and United States data (e.g., Long and Jones 1980)
       The plan of this paper is as follows: Section II describes

our statistical model and briefly mentions theoretical predictions
of the variables in the model. Section III reports the empirical
results. Finally, section IV gives a summary of the findings.

II. THE SPECIFICATION OF MODEL

The variables in our model are cross-sectional market averages

obtained from the 1980 Population Census of Japan. The ratio of
part—time employed married women to the total population of
married women over age 15 is defined as the labor force

participation rate of part-time employed married women in

a given prefecture "i" (hereafter, PARTLFP1). PARTLFP. have
their values between zero and one.9 The logit model of married
women's part-time labor force participation is defined as
follows (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 1976):


                                        1
             P. =
              1
                    F(Y.)
                       1
                            =                               (1)
                                                —AX.
                                    1 + e          1



where P. is the probability of being in labor market as part-time
employees for married women in the i-th prefecture; F() is
the cumulative logistic probability function; and X1 is a vector

of right-hand-side variables.

       Equation (1) is rewritten after substituting PARTLFP1 for
   as follows (Neter and Wasserman 1974)


                      PARTLFP.
        *
   PTLFP = log(
                                1
                                            )=AX +     e.   (2)
                    1 - PARTLFP.

where e is asymptotically distributed with mean zero and

variance (l/(TOTMARiX i x
                                          T0M is the total
number of married women over age 15 in cities (Shi"      in
Jpaneses) in the i—th prefecture.
        The following simultaneous—equation model is estimated:

where the variables in the model are defined in Table 1.
Equations (3) and   (4) are estimated with the weights,

WGTi    (TOTMARixPARTLFPix(1ePARTLPPi)
                                           1/2   and (m) 1/2,
in the above simultaneous—equation model,  respectively.
        Tables 1 and 2 present the difinitions of the variables
and their statistics in the model. The theoretical reasons for
including the variables in each equation and their expected
signs are extensively discussed in the literature (Ben—Porath
1973, Cain and   Dooley   1976, Cain and Weininger 1973, De Tray
1973, Fields 1976, Fleisher and Rhodes 1976 and 1979a,
                                   8




Long and Jones 1980, Michael 1973b, and Willis 1973), We will,
therefore, comment on only some of the variables in each equation.

       Concerning equation (3), a labor supply equation, women's
part-time market wage rate (LNPATW1 in natural logarithm) will
have a positive effect on married women's part-time labor force

participation because the higher market wage rate will cover
more individuals with different reservation wages, ceteris

paribus (Ben—Porath 1973). The bearing and raising of children
are women's time—intensive nonmarket activities, which will
inhibit market work by married women (Cain and Dooley 1976).

Therefore, an increase in the fertility rate (FERTI1) is expected
to have a negative effect on married women's labor supply,

The effect of market unemployment rate (UNEMP,) on married women's

labor supply is ambiguous, although a negative discouraged worker
effect seems to dominate a positive added worker effect in Japan
(Furugori 1980) and in the United States (Bowen and Finegan 1969,

Cain and Dooley 1976, Dooley 1982, Fields 1976, and Fleisher and
Rhodes 1976 and 1979b). An industry mix variable (INDMI)
represents employment opportunities for women and its effect

should be positive (Bowen and Finegan 1969, Cain and Dooley 1976,
Fields 1976, and Fleisher and Rhodes 1976 and l979b)
                                    9




          The sign of female education (EDUCA1) is expected to
be negative, based on previous works (Hill 19814, and Yarnada and

Yamada 1984). Shapiro and Shaw (1983) argue, whether or not
higher educational attainment for married women increases their

labor supply depends on the relative strength of a higher market
wage and a greater shadow price of time. In a married women's
labor supply equation with their market wage rate and education
as the explanatory variables, the coefficient of their education

reflects the shadow price of time and the sign is, therefore,
expected to be negative. On the other hand, female education
may reflect their tastes for market work and/or access to jobs

with nonpecuniary benefits (Cain and Dooley 1976). Also this may have
a nonneutral effect on the productivity of time in the labor market
more than that of time spent in household production (Leibowitz

1974) .   These hypotheses, therefore, predict a positive effect of
EDUCA1 on women's labor supply. Recent empirical work with
United States data shows that the sign is significantly positive

for married women, e.g., Dooley (1982) and Fleisher and Rhodes

(1976), whereas Cogan (1981) , Long and Jones (1980) and Shapiro

and Shaw (1983) find a negative association.11 The proportion
of children who go to either nursery schools or kindergartens
(KIND5) will have a positive effect because those available

facilities will provide a good opportunity for married women to
                                  10




substitute for their own time-inputs into childrearing (Schultz
1978)

        With respect to the fertility equation (4) , women's
part—time wage rate (LNPATW) and married women's part-time labor
supply (PTLFP1) are expected to have a negative effect on married
women's fertility (FERTI) because they will reflect the opportunity
costs of bearing and raising children (Cain and Dooley 1976,
Cain and Weininger 1973, Link and Settle 1981, and Schultz 1974)

The negative sign on LNPATW1 is expected on the basis of the

assumption that the negative substitution effect dominates the
positive income effect on fertility. The effect of the husband's
income (LNHINC. in natural logarithm) is expected to be positive,
ceteris paribus. Female education (EDUCA) is used as a proxy
variable for effective contraceptive knowledge and the expected

sign, therefore, will be negative (Cain and Dooley 1976, Cain and
Weininger 1973, Hashimoto 1974, and Michael 1973b). The quality
of children (CHILQ1) is included to observe "thea proper

coefficient of LNHINC. and the coefficient of CHILQ.
                                                   1
                                                     will be
                     1
negative because of the substitution of the quality and quantity
                                       12
of children (Becker and Lewis 1973),

        Finally, both labor supply and fertility equations are
                                                          13
estimated by a method of two—stage least squares (2SLS).

Since the both equations in the model are not exactly identified,
                                    11




we use asymptotic t—statistics to evaluate the second-stage

estimates (Fleisher and Rhodes 1976, and Maddala 1974).
As mentioned earlier, since the labor supply equation is the
logit transformation, its F—statistic is reported for evaluation

rather than R—square (Hill 1984).

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The model of simultaneous equations discussed in the previous
section was applied to the urban areas from 47 prefectures in
1980. The model was estimated with weighted data by a method

of two—stage least squares (2SLS). Table 3 reports the estimates
of the structural coefficients obtained by 2SLS. Model I consists
of the logit equation of married women's labor supply as part-

time employees (I—(l)) and the fertility equation (I—(2)).
Model II is the same specification as Model I but the labor

supply is measured by the proportion of married women who are

part—time employees, PARTLFP, which is, therefore, not the logit
transformation. Table 4 reports the empirical results under
the assumption that the behavior of married women's part-time

labor supply is not simultaneous but independent of their fertility
behavior. Equations (3) and (4) in Table 4 are a single—equation
logit model estimated by a method of generalized least squares
(GLS) for the urban areas and all (urban and rural together) areas

from 47 prefectures in Japan, respectively. Table 5 summarizes
our recent findings of the wage and income elasticities of
married women's labor supply.
                               16




3-1. Labor Supply
The estimates of the labor supply equations are generally
consistent with the economic hypotheses and statistically
significant at the various significance levels. Since most
of the estimates in elasticity terms change little in

Model I—(l) and Model II-(1) in Table 3 and equation (3) in
Table 4, our following discussion is made mainly about
the results of Model I-(1)
       The logit model of the married women's part-time labor

supply (Model I—(l) in Table 3) is statistically significant
at the 1% significance level (F—statistic=10.70). The estimated
coefficient of the women's part—time wage variable (LNPATW) is
significantly positive. To recover the partial derivative of

LNPATW, we multiply the coefficient, 0.904, by 0.177
(=O.229x(1—O.229)) where 0.229 is the sample mean of

the proportion of married women as part-time employees (PARTLFP).
Since LNPATW is in a natural logarithmic form, the point estimate
of the elasticity of PARTLFP with respect to LNPATW will be

obtained by dividing the value of the partial derivative,

0.160 (0.9O4x0.177) , by 0.229, which results in about 0.7 at
the sample mean. This wage elasticity is more than three times

as large as that of urban full-time employed married women's,

0.2 as shown in Table 5, although the former is slightly larger

than the wage elasticity of female, 0.44 (Hill 1984).
                                       17




       mong previous work with U.S. data which rarely
differentiates married women's part-time employment from their

full—time employment, Long and Jones (1980) specifically focuses
on part-time married women workers and finds the wage elasticity,

0.25, with the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of women 30-40.
Therefore, the wage elasticity of married women's part-time labor

supply in Japan is much larger than that for U.S. married women.

On the other hand, the part—time wage elasticity in Japan, 0.7,
is generally smaller than those reported in recent U.S. studies
which do no differentiate part-time from full-time workers:

2.0 (Cain and Dooley 1976) ,    0.44   and 3.4 (Dooley 1982) ,   4.2
(Fleisher and Rhodes 1979a) ,      1,28 for a mean of eleven studies
(Keeley 1981) , and 2.2 and 3.5 (Shapiro and Shaw 1983).

       The effect of husband's income (LNHINC) is negative and

statistically significant (—0.642 in Model I—(l) in Table 3).
The income elasticity is about -0.5 at the sample mean, which
is less than one third of that of urban married women's full-

time employment (—1.8 in Table 5). However, the income elasticity,
—0.5, is rougly equal to that for female employees for 1970,

—0.52 (Hill 1984) .   The part—time income elasticity is significantly
larger than that of U.S. married women in absolute value, -0.068

(Long and Jones 1980) ,   while,    in similar simultaneous—equation

models, the part-time income elasticity in urban Japan is nearly
half or a third of that of U.S. married women (-1.2 in Cain and

Dooley 1976, and —1.4 in Fleisher arid Rhodes 1979a)
                                  18




      The variables of unemployment rate (UNEMP) and female

education (EDUCA) are most significant in the labor supply
equation. With respect to the negative coefficient of UNEMP,
the discouraged worker effect dominates the added worker effect

among the part-time employed married women, The elasticity
with respect to UNEMP at the sample mean, —0,25, indicates that
a one percent increase in UNEMP reduces the probability of

choosing part-time paid jobs for married women by 0.25 percent.
The effect of female education (EDUCA) is significantly negative
and the elasticity is —0,51 at the sample mean. Married women's

education in urban Japan, therefore, increases their shadow price
of time, inhibiting them from joining labor markets rather than
their education reflecting a taste for market work,

       The effects of an industry mix variable (INDMI) is
significantly positive, 0.052. That is, an increase in relative

availability of jobs for women encourages more married women to

join to labor force. Similarly, the significantly positive
effect of the enrollment of children in nursery schools or
kindergartens (KIND5) indicates that an availability of day—care

centers and nursery schools encourages married women with
pre—school children to join the labor market. However, with

higher labor force participation for married women, the demand
                                    19




for day-care centers and nursery schools will increase. Therefore,
the causality between KIND5 and married women's part—time labor

supply may be dual.

       For comparative purposes, Model II—(1) is reported when
the labor supply of part-time employed married women as the
dependent variable is measured by the proportion of married
women over age 15 who are part-time employees in urban Japan.
The labor supply equation in a simultaneous-equation model
explains 65 percent of the married womens labor supply behavior

as part-time employees in urban Japan. In Table 4, equations
(3) and (14)   are a single-equation logit model of labor supply
separately for urban areas and all (urban and rural together)

areas from 47 prefectures, respectively. Concerning the GLS
estimates of equation (3), the elasticities of LNHINC and UNEMP
becomes —0.46 and —0.22 from -0,49 and —0.25 in Model I—(1),
respectively, while other elasticities show virtually no changes
and INDMI becomes marginally insignificant.

       For a summary, our findings support Hill's contributions

about female labor supply in Japan (Hill 1982 and 1984):
in our terms, a logit model of married women's part-time labor

supply explains their behavior for grouped data well; and

a proportion of married women over age 15 who are part-time

employees is a suitable measure for their part-time labor force
                                  20




participation rate. The basic socioeconomic variables in our

simultaneous—equation model are significantly robust.

The elasticities of married women's part-time labor supply
with respect to their part—time wage rate and husband's income
are about 0.7 and -0.5 for 1980 in urban Japan, respectively.

3—2. Fertility

The fertility equations are listed as Model E—(2) and Model fl—(2)
in Table 3. Both equations are statistically significant at
the 1% significance level. We focus only on the results of
Model I—(2) as a pair of Model I—Cl) because of no significant
changes with their results in terms of elasticity.
         The women's part-time wage rate (WPATW), husband's
income (LNHXNC) and married women's    part—time labor supply (PTLFP5),
all   are insignificant. The unexpected insignificant coefficients
of LNPATW and PTLFPt in addition to that of FERTI in Model I-Cl)

indicate that there is little simultaneous interdependency between
married women's fertility and their decisions to work as part-time
employees)4 Married women probably enter the labor force as

part—time employees at a different stage of their life cycle than
their full—time counterparts. That , part—time employed married
women might already complete their desired fertilities and, while
sending their children to day—care centers or nursery schools,
join   the labor markets.

        The variables of unemployment (UNEMP), female education
(EDUCA), and the quality of children (CHILQ) have their expected

signs and all are statistically significant. The elasticities
are about 0.2 for UNEMP, —0.4 for EDUCA, and —1.3 for CElLO.
                                22




The positive coefficient on UNEMP indicates that married women

tend to give birth when the opportunity costs are low. The same

result is also found with U.S. married women (Cain and Weininger
1973). On the other hand, the negative effect of EDUCA on FERTI
agrees with the view that married womens education is a proxy
for their knowledge of birth control techniques. The effect of
child quality (CHILO) is the most significant variable in the
fertility equation. The negative sign shows the substitution of

the quality and quantity of children, whose elasticity, -1.3,
in urban Japan is larger than -0.92 with U.S. married women in

absolute value (Fleisher and Rhodes l979a).
       Finally, as a brief summary, the specification on

the fertility equation is satisfactory but the R-square (0.39)
and F-statistic (4.30) are much smaller than those of the labor
supply equation, Furthermore, we suspect that there is a
simultaneous interdependency between married women's decisions

to work as part—time employees and their fertility in urban Japan.

IV. SUMMARY

In   this paper, we have estimated a logit model of married women's

part-time employment and a fertility equation in a simultaneous-
equation model. The model is applied to the urban areas from

47 prefectures in 1980, using the prefectural grouped data in
the 1980 Population Ceusus of Japan.

        By specifically differentiating part—time employed married
women from full-time employed, we find that the structural

coefficients of the part—time labor supply significantly differ
from those of the full-time labor supply in terms of elasticity.
The major factors influencing married women's part-time labor

supply are their part—time wage rate, husband's income, total
unemployment rate, women's education, and the availability of
nursery schools and kindergartens. The elasticities of their
labor supply with respect to women's part-time wage rate and
husband's income are about 0.7 and -0.5, respectively.
        The specification on the fertility equation in a simultaneous—

equation model is satisfactory, but the variables pertaining to

married women's part-time work, e.g., women's part-time wage rate
and their part—time labor force participation, are statistically

insignificant. Other socioeconomic variables, e.g., total
unemployment rate, women's education, and child quality, are
                                28




found to be significantly strong factors influencing marital

fertility.
       As a concluding remark, contrary to the result of our
previous study on married women's full-time employment, we
find little interdependency between married women's decisions to

work as part-time employees and their fertility in urban Japan.

the employees who either work for shorter daily hours or work
for shorter weekly or monthly hours for a certain period, e.g.,
35 hours or less per week, irrespective of their daily work hours
than regular full—time employees. According to Takahashi (1983),
about 86 percent of female part-time employees were married women
with spouse present, 10 percent were either widows or divorced, and
only about 4 percent were unmarried single women in 1981.

       31n 1980, 52.3 percent of female part—time employees in
non—agricultural and forestory industries were employed in firms
employing 1—29 employees, 12.9 percent in firms employing 30-99
employees. 9.8 percent in firms employing 100-499 employees,
16.4 percent in firms employing 500 or more employees, and
9.4 percent in the government. Source: Japan (1982), Actual
Conditions of Women's Labor, Table 28 in p.89.
In 1980, the wage rates per hour for female part-time employees in
manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and service industries
were 558 yen, 624 yen, and 705 yen, respectively. Those wage rates
were about 83.5 percent, 78.5 percent, and 80.4 percent of
the female full—time employees' wage rates in each respective
industry. The ratio of hourly wage rate of female part—time
employees to that of the full-time employees varied according to
the size of the firms. The part—time employees earned 63.4 percent of
the full—time employees' wage rate in firms which employed 1,000 or more
employees, in firms which employed 100—999 the ratio was 78.4
percent, and in firms which employed 10-99 the ratio was 84.6
percent. Source: Japan (1982), Actual Conditions of Women's Labor,

       41n 1970, 57 percent of female part—time employees were
employed in the manufacturing industry, 27,7 percent in the wholesale
and retail trade industry, and 8.1 percent in the service industry.
In 1980, those figures became 37.0 percent, 45,5 percent, and
14.1 percent in each respective industry. Source: Japan (1982),

        In 1980, 36 percent of the female labor force was self—
employed or family workers.
       6To my knowledge, there are only a few recent studies on
part—time employed married women even in the United States, e.g.,
Grainm (1973) and Long and Jones (1980).

Female part—time employees in non-agricultural and forestry industries
gave the following reasons to work in 1981:
60.3 percent of the female part-time employees worked to help pay
household expenses; 12,6 percent worked to help pay their own
school—enpenses or their children's school-expenses; 7.9 percent
worked for the purpose of efficiently utilizing their leisure
hours; and 5,9 percent worked to help pay housing loans.

       9mere are numerous studies on women's labor force participation
using disaggregated data rather than grouped data and dealing with
the selectivity bias in the labor supply model. Gronau (1974) and
Heckman (1974 and 1979) are some of the early theoretical works,
while Smith (1980) and Heckman et al. (1981) are the comprehensive
survey of the recent development of the labor supply.
Hill (1983) used Heckman's estimation procedures for the sample
selection bias applied a trichotomous logit model to a 1975 survey
data of married women between the ages of 20 to 59 in the Tokyo
Metropolitan area.
       10The industry mix variable is constructed by using these
following industries: agriculture, forestry and hunting, fishery
and aquaculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, wholesale
and retail trade, finance and insurance, real estate, transportation
and communication, utilities (electricity, water and steam),
services, and government.

       11Leibowitz (1974) finds more educated women spending more
of their time in child care and gives the following explanations:
child care has the low substitution elasticity with other inputs;
and more educated women have a greater productivity in child care
in household production. p.249.

       12De Tray (1974) uses expected public school investment
per child in dollars for the quality per child, while Fleisher
and Rhodes (1979a) uses wage on current or last job for out-of-
school youth as the child quality. In our study, we follow
De Tray (1974) because of the availability of data although
this sort of reasoning may be vulnerable. In the fertility
equation (4), CHILQ is listed as if the variable were one of
the exogenous variables in the model. Although we do not
explicitly specify the child—quality equation because the
estimation is not our primary concern, the estimated CHILQ is
included as one of the explanatory variables in the fertility
equation.
       '31n the first stage of 2SLS, we regress PTLFP*, FERTI,
and CHILO on LNPATW,LNHINC, UNEMP, INDMI, EDUCA, KIND5, CHILD,
and EMPCH.

         Yamada and Yamada (1984) finds a significant interdependency
between full-time employed married women and marital fertility
in urban Japan. The elasticity of married women's fertility
with respect to their labor supply is about —0.3.
